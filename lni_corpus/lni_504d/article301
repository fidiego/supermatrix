an
increasing
number
of
immigration
cases
are
being
litigated
at
the
circuit
level
and
many
immigration
lawyers
may
be
illprepared
for
the
challenges
the
percentage
of
cases
being
appealed
from
the
intermediate
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
the
circuits
has
shot
up
from
5
percent
in
2000
to
25
percent
in
2004
the
spike
which
has
occurred
in
all
types
of
immigration
cases
but
especially
deportation
and
asylum
matters
is
largely
the
consequence
of
policies
designed
to
streamline
the
bia
that
were
first
implemented
in
2002
the
changes
eliminated
a
case
backlog
but
many
immigration
attorneys
contend
that
the
quality
of
review
has
deteriorated
and
they
are
left
with
no
choice
but
to
take
cases
up
to
the
federal
circuits
what
weve
seen
is
a
general
rubberstamping
of
immigration
judges
if
you
want
an
appellate
court
to
hear
your
case
chances
are
you
have
to
appeal
to
the
circuit
said
greg
siskind
an
immigration
attorney
in
memphis
tenn
the
deluge
of
cases
is
taking
its
toll
on
lawyers
courts
and
clients
immigration
attorneys
admit
that
many
practitioners
are
not
accustomed
to
the
rigorous
appellate
process
the
american
immigration
law
foundation
has
seen
a
growing
demand
for
their
workshops
which
are
designed
to
help
immigration
attorneys
improve
their
litigation
skills
many
lawyers
are
anxious
about
going
into
federal
appeals
court
despite
years
in
immigration
court
its
a
different
world
said
beth
werlin
litigation
clearinghouse
attorney
for
the
foundation
for
lawyers
who
are
used
to
a
volumepractice
in
immigration
court
arguing
before
a
circuit
court
can
be
a
huge
change
said
david
leopold
an
immigration
attorney
in
cleveland
its
also
a
dicey
proposition
for
their
clients
who
have
to
wait
longer
and
pay
more
to
appeal
their
cases
another
rung
the
surge
in
appeals
is
creating
a
messy
backlog
for
the
courts
some
federal
appellate
judges
have
made
no
secret
of
their
frustration
lashing
out
repeatedly
at
the
way
the
government
attorneys
are
handling
cases
and
the
shoddy
quality
of
the
judicial
records
they
see
on
review
judge
richard
posner
of
the
7th
circuit
recently
issued
a
scathing
ruling
criticizing
the
immigration
courts
and
the
us
justice
departments
office
of
immigration
litigation
for
its
handling
of
asylum
cases
the
performance
of
these
federal
agencies
is
too
often
inadequate
he
wrote
for
a
threejudge
panel
that
overturned
the
denial
of
asylum
for
an
albanian
woman
this
case
presents
us
with
another
depressing
example
posner
continued
this
case
has
been
poorly
handled
by
the
government
at
every
stage
the
proceeding
before
the
immigration
judge
the
summary
affirmance
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
decision
by
the
government
in
this
court
to
put
all
its
eggs
in
a
basket
that
it
should
have
known
would
not
hold
them

two
causes
intending
to
address
a
backlog
of
over
60000
immigration
cases
former
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
decided
in
2002
to
cut
the
number
of
bia
judges
from
23
to
11
and
increase
the
use
of
singlejudge
decisions
additionally
new
regs
broadened
the
type
of
cases
in
which
the
bia
could
issue
summary
affirmances
without
opinion
essentially
a
single
board
member
can
review
the
decision
of
an
immigration
judge
and
write
a
onesentence
opinion
stating
that
the
board
affirms
without
opinion
the
result
is
that
the
ijs
oral
or
written
decision
becomes
the
final
administrative
decision
of
the
agency
said
geoffrey
heeren
senior
attorney
with
the
legal
assistance
foundation
of
metropolitan
chicago
a
new
law
the
2005
real
id
act
which
bars
noncitizens
from
seeking
habeas
corpus
relief
in
district
court
for
most
detention
and
deportation
cases
has
further
inundated
the
circuits
with
immigration
cases
real
id
said
were
repealing
the
ability
for
people
to
go
through
district
court
and
everything
has
to
go
through
the
circuits
therefore
anything
pending
in
us
district
court
including
immigration
cases
is
automatically
transferred
said
laura
lichter
an
immigration
attorney
in
denver
effects
on
immigration
practice
seasoned
immigration
lawyers
say
that
the
federal
appellate
process
adds
another
layer
of
difficulty
to
a
practice
area
where
a
vulnerable
client
population
intersects
with
a
labyrinthian
administrative
process
added
to
that
said
lichter
we
often
see
sloppy
lawyering
at
the
administrative
level
and
a
poor
record
by
the
court
so
youre
stuck
with
that
record
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
circuit
lichter
who
is
an
elected
director
of
the
board
of
governors
for
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
said
that
researching
and
writing
an
appellate
brief
is
a
specialized
and
demanding
function
that
some
firms
used
to
a
volume
practice
are
not
set
up
to
do
to
do
it
right
takes
time
and
effort
and
were
seeing
that
some
of
the
appellate
lawyering
is
really
not
up
to
snuff
she
said
further
most
immigration
firms
have
multijurisdictional
or
national
practices
and
this
requires
familiarity
with
more
than
one
circuits
rules
jack
richbourg
an
immigration
attorney
in
memphis
tenn
has
handled
appeals
before
several
federal
appellate
courts
including
the
2nd
4th
6th
and
11th
circuits
its
a
complicated
process
to
perfect
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
he
said
although
the
law
is
the
same
the
local
rules
of
procedure
differ
and
as
soon
as
you
file
an
appeal
they
request
you
file
a
brief
within
60
days
and
that
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
lawyers
richbourg
also
noted
that
the
details
can
differ
markedly
some
circuits
require
a
joint
appendix
with
opposing
counsel
while
others
ask
that
lawyers
not
include
a
joint
appendix
and
each
circuit
has
its
own
page
limits
and
citation
requirements
another
pitfall
is
that
the
circuits
do
not
respond
as
quickly
as
district
courts
and
some
circuits
routinely
deny
stays
of
deportation
while
an
appeal
is
pending
this
can
lead
to
kafkaesque
consequences
lichter
recently
represented
a
north
african
political
asylum
seeker
who
was
deported
during
his
appeal
to
the
10th
circuit
because
the
court
denied
a
stay
request
after
he
went
home
we
won
his
case
i
called
him
in
algeria
to
tell
him
the
good
news
but
the
10th
circuit
doesnt
have
the
authority
to
bring
him
back
meanwhile
to
add
insult
to
injury
the
published
decision
was
all
over
the
internet
and
my
client
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
be
killed
if
we
didnt
shut
down
the
sites
lichter
recalled
the
client
was
eventually
allowed
back
in
the
united
states
only
because
his
wife
a
us
citizen
had
previously
filed
to
legalize
his
status
the
decision
is

the
increased
number
of
appeals
may
have
its
benefits
however
one
advantage
is
there
is
now
an
opportunity
to
make
law
on
issues
that
otherwise
would
not
be
decided
were
starting
to
see
a
more
nuanced
and
fuller
body
of
federal
precedent
coming
out
of
this
the
federal
courts
are
more
rigorous
than
the
board
ever
was
even
at
its
best
heeren
said
changes
on
the
way
some
hints
are
emerging
that
change
may
be
on
the
way
werlin
of
the
american
immigration
law
foundation
said
that
she
has
seen
anecdotal
evidence
that
the
bia
has
started
issuing
fewer
rubber
stamp
affirmances
this
may
be
because
of
a
jan
9
2006
memo
issued
by
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
that
expressed
his
concerns
about
the
quality
of
work
of
immigration
judges
and
the
intemperate
or
even
abusive
conduct
by
some
judges
the
memo
promised
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
immigration
courts
by
a
deputy
who
will
give
recommendations
for
improvement
some
circuits
are
also
altering
their
practices
because
of
the
immigration
caseload
for
example
the
2nd
circuit
has
come
up
with
new
rules
for
oral
arguments
to
address
the
backlog
of
immigration
cases
and
the
9th
circuit
is
actively
working
with
the
immigration
bar
to
improve
the
quality
of
lawyering
in
immigration
appeals
