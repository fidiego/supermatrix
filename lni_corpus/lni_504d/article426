immigration
to
the
united
states
during
the
1980s
is
expected
to
match
or
exceed
the
historic
high
mark
set
by
the
flood
of
nearly
9
million
immigrants
who
reached
american
shores
in
the
first
decade
of
the
century
according
to
a
new
study
of
government
statistics
the
report
by
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
research
group
concluded
that
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
between
1981
and
1990
will
equal
or
surpass
the
87
million
total
between
1901
and
1910
if
illegal
immigrants
are
included
the
current
total
would
be
several
million
higher
the
group
found
in
contrast
with
the
earlier
peak
which
was
characterized
mainly
by
unskilled
immigrants
from
europe
the
new
arrivals
are
primarily
of
asian
and
hispanic
descent
the
report
said
the
current
wave
has
rekindled
debate
over
the
nations
ability
to
absorb
large
numbers
of
immigrants
government
officials
and
private
immigration
specialists
said
they
agreed
with
the
studys
findings
the
immigration
in
the
80s
is
very
significant
because
these
are
historic
highs
said
doris
meissner
an
immigration
expert
at
the
carnegie
foundation
and
former
acting
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
we
are
only
now
beginning
to
grapple
with
how
the
size
and
composition
of
this
immigration
is
going
to
affect
our
national
life
it
looks
like
the
numbers
will
reach
85
million
and
perhaps
even
go
over
the
9
million
mark
this
decade
said
duke
austin
an
ins
spokesman
and
this
will
be
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
country
according
to
the
centers
study
the
current
immigration
wave
will
mark
the
second
time
the
number
of
arrivals
in
one
decade
has
surpassed
8
million
since
1820
when
the
government
began
keeping
records
the
figure
for
the
present
decade
has
been
bolstered
in
part
by
24
million
immigrants
who
have
sought
amnesty
under
the
revised
immigration
law
in
the
past
seven
years
4
million
legal
immigrants
were
admitted
to
the
united
states
according
to
ins
statistics
officials
said
18
million
are
expected
by
1990
if
current
trends
continue
the
total
is
expected
to
reach
the
87
million
mark
with
the
addition
of
those
granted
amnesty
along
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
and
other
immigrants
who
have
received
political
asylum
and
are
expected
to
be
granted
permanent
resident
status
legal
immigrants
are
people
admitted
because
they
have
close
relatives
who
are
us
citizens
or
residents
because
they
are
refugees
or
have
been
granted
political
asylum
and
have
become
permanent
residents
or
because
they
are
foreign
workers
with
skills
that
are
in
short
supply
in
the
united
states
the
influx
of
immigrants
who
like
their
predecessors
have
come
to
the
united
states
to
escape
economic
and
political
instability
is
expected
to
have
longlasting
repercussions
on
all
aspects
of
american
life
from
business
to
politics
to
social
institutions
experts
said
the
immigrants
are
leading
us
toward
a
less
standardized
society
and
making
us
make
adjustments
in
our
cultural
and
language
practices
said
david
simcox
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
in
areas
where
they
are
settling
in
disproportionate
numbers
there
is
disruption
to
the
economy
housing
schools
and
health
facilities
meissner
said
and
theres
been
no
local
planning
for
this
because
local
governments
have
not
been
prepared
however
thomas
espenshade
a
senior
fellow
at
the
urban
institute
a
research
group
cited
research
showing
that
the
benefits
of
immigration
probably
offset
the
disadvantages
by
satisfying
the
demand
for
labor
and
adding
variety
to
the
culture
theres
no
doubt
that
todays
immigration
is
good
for
the
country
said
rick
swartz
president
of
the
national
immigration
refugee
and
citizenship
forum
a
coalition
of
church
ethnic
and
legal
organizations
the
diversity
of
cultures
and
backgrounds
and
ethnic
heritage
is
a
great
source
of
energy
and
strength
to
the
american
identity
the
complexity
of
the
issue
is
revealed
by
differing
attitudes
among
americans
whose
parents
or
grandparents
were
immigrants
joe
gentiles

and

a
public
information
officer
for
the
dc
police
department
said
he
understands
how
recent
immigrants
fleeing
from
political
repression
and
economic
problems
look
to
this
country
and
say
thats
got
to
be
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
and
i
want
to
live
there
steve
rosen
a
45yearold
defense
department
employee
who
belongs
to
a
conservative
immigration
organization
is
proud
he
said
that
his
grandparents
came
from
poland
and
czechoslovakia
but
he
favors
stricter
controls
on
immigration
the
immigration
from
the
turn
of
the
century
was
largely
a
continuation
of
immigration
from
previous
years
in
that
the
european
stock
of
america
was
being
maintained
he
said
now
we
are
having
a
large
influx
of
third
world
people
which
could
be
potentionally
disruptive
of
our
whole
judeochristian
heritage
immigration
experts
said
there
has
always
been
some
antiimmigrant
sentiment
in
the
united
states
at
the
turn
of
the
century
the
number
of
italian
greek
polish
and
eastern
european
immigrants
began
to
overtake
the
total
immigrating
from
other
parts
of
europe
at
the
time
we
said
the
eastern
and
southern
europeans
were
inferior
people
said
demetrios
papademetriou
an
immigration
expert
at
the
us
labor
department
there
is
an
old
immigrant
saying
that
goes
america
beckons
but
americans
repell
said
alan
kraut
a
history
professor
at
american
university
the
country
has
always
needed
and
continues
to
need
immigrants
to
energize
us
culturally
and
intellectually
and
fuel
the
economy
but
at
the
same
time
americans
always
feel
threatened
and
are
fearful
of
newcomers
concern
over
the
recent
wave
of
immigrants
especially
hispanics
has
given
rise
to
an
effort
to
make
english
the
official
us
language
so
far
16
states
have
adopted
english
as
the
official
language
and
the
issue
will
be
on
the
ballot
in
november
in
three
other
states
population
control
groups
have
expressed
fears
we
see
immigration
as
an
important
part
of
our
overall
population
picture
said
donald
mann
the
president
of
negative
population
growth
inc
which
has
called
for
limiting
immigration
levels
to
100000
people
a
year
roger
conner
president
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
lobbies
for
tighter
controls
on
immigration
argued
that
if
high
immigration
rates
continue
every
major
longrange
ecological
problem
will
be
vastly
greater
to
solve
the
group
also
contends
that
immigrants
depress
wages
and
displace
us
workers
but
karl
zinsmeister
a
social
demographer
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
a
conservative
group
said
that
although
immigrants
sometimes
depress
wages
in
the
long
run
they
are
an
asset
the
american
formula
only
works
when
we
are
creating
new
opportunities
and
expanding
horizons
he
said
in
such
states
as
california
florida
texas
and
new
york
where
immigrants
are
settling
in
large
concentrations
profound
shifts
are
taking
place
demographers
said
according
to
ins
statistics
almost
70
percent
of
the
immigrants
in
1987
settled
in
those
four
states
along
with
new
jersey
and
illinois
and
the
six
states
have
been
magnets
for
immigrants
for
more
than
10
years
the
washington
area
drew
the
fifth
largest
concentration
of
legal
immigrants
last
year
after
new
york
los
angeles
miamihialeah
and
chicago
officials
said
leon
bouvier
a
demographer
and
former
vice
president
of
the
population
reference
bureau
an
information
clearinghouse
said
that
although
the
us
population
has
tripled
since
the
turn
of
the
century
immigration
now
has
a
greater
impact
because
the
fertility
rate
is
much
lower
within
the
next
20
to
25
years
whites
will
become
a
minority
in
california
texas
and
new
york
as
the
result
of
immigration
by
asians
and
hispanics
he
said
to
me
thats
a
dramatic
shift
and
rather
than
hide
it
lets
talk
about
it
and
get
these
people
to
fit
into
the
economy
according
to
a
recent
study
by
bouvier
the
six
states
where
the
majority
of
immigrants
have
settled
had
16
more
congressional
seats
in
1980
than
they
would
have
had
if
the
immigrants
had
not
settled
there
between
1950
and
1980
california
gained
six
seats
through
immigration
and
florida
gained
two
the
shift
of
seats
to
immigrationheavy
states
is
likely
to
accelerate
in
the
next
three
decades
as
immigration
remains
high
and
the
countrys
natural
increase
continues
to
slow
bouvier
said
at
the
turn
of
the
century
when
the
united
states
needed
unskilled
and
semiskilled
workers
and
there
were
few
restrictions
on
immigration
85
percent
of
the
immigrants
were
from
eastern
or
western
europe
officials
said
in
contrast
almost
85
percent
of
the
recent
immigrants
are
from
asia
or
latin
america
with
europeans
accounting
for
only
about
11
percent
of
the
total
the
shift
has
occurred
because
of
an
increasing
number
of
refugee
admissions
and
changes
in
immigration
law
officials
said
the
revisions
lifted
restrictions
against
immigration
from
asia
and
gave
preference
to
foreigners
with
close
relatives
in
the
united
states
rather
than
those
with
skills
in
short
supply
here
last
year
for
example
of
601516
immigrants
to
the
united
states
430384
were
admitted
because
they
were
family
members
of
us
citizens
or
residents
about
96000
were
refugees
or
people
who
had
been
granted
political
asylum
and
who
had
become
permanent
residents
only
about
50000
were
admitted
because
of
employment
skills
in
an
attempt
to
address
that
imbalance
the
senate
this
year
passed
a
bill
that
would
allow
more
immigrants
into
the
country
for
occupational
reasons
and
raise
the
yearly
limit
on
the
overall
number
of
immigrants
a
similar
measure
has
been
introduced
in
the
house
experts
said
immigration
levels
are
likely
to
remain
high
during
the
1990s
as
immigrants
who
are
already
here
try
to
bring
their
family
members
and
as
economic
conditions
in
latin
america
and
some
asian
countries
are
considered
likely
to
deteriorate
i
think
in
the
the
90s
the
us
will
continue
to
be
a
very
inviting
place
for
immigrants
simcox
said
he
cited
two
factors
that
will
act
as
a
magnet
to
attract
immigrants
the
established
immigrant
network
and
expected
labor
shortages
in
some
sectors
of
the
economy
david
north
an
immigration
scholar
who
works
for
transcentury
inc
a
study
group
here
agreed
this
continues
to
be
an
attractive
place
to
live
and
people
come
here
because
they
feel
they
can
get
a
better
life
that
was
true
at
the
turn
of
the
century
and
it
probably
will
be
true
at
the
turn
of
the
next
century
