he

have

length
497
words
continuing
his
recent
push
to
have
washington
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
into
law
president
obama
told
univision
wednesday
that
he
expects
a
bill
on
immigration
overhaul
to
be
ready
by
april obama
sat
down
with
the
latino
tv
network
to
talk
about
the
recent
developments
on
the
immigration
reform
front
including
the
progress
of
the
bipartisan
senate
group
known
as
the
gang
of
eight
which
has
been
working
on
a
compromise
bill
on
immigration amid
reports
that
the
group
has
reached
an
impasse
president
obama
assured
that
the
group
was
still
making
progress
and
are
actually
very
close
to
finalizing
a
deal
on
a
formal
immigration
bill im
actually
optimistic
that
when
they
get
back
they
will
introduce
a
bill
obama
said
during
the
interview
my
sense
is
that
they
have
come
close
and
my
expectation
is
that
well
actually
see
a
bill
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
next
month the
forecast
stayed
true
to
the
senate
panels
desire
to
have
a
bill
issued
soon
after
the
senate
reconvenes
after
easter
vacation if
a
bill
is
presented
by
the
start
of
april
president
obama
expressed
confidence
that
the
bill
could
be
passed
and
signed
into
law
by
the
end
of
the
summer
however
with
his
own
proposal
on
immigration
law
ready
as
a
backup
the
president
reiterated
a
previous
promise
to
submit
his
version
of
the
bill
to
congress
should
they
fail
to
come
up
with
a
feasible
immigration
plan
the
march
interview
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
public
appearances
that
obama
has
made
since
january
when
he
began
his
push
for
immigration
reform
as
part
of
his
campaign
vow
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
laws
both
the
president
and
republicans
in
congress
have
been
pressured
by
latino
voters
who
voted
for
obama
in
record
numbers
during
the
november
elections
to
make
immigration
overhaul
a
priority
after
years
of
delays
on
capitol
hill
however
there
still
remain
some
republicans
who
are
weary
over
the
rapidly
approaching
deadline
that
obama
has
mandated
on
immigration
reform
recently
six
republican
senators
sent
a
letter
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
urging
them
to
allow
legislators
more
time
to
read
and
analyze
an
immigration
bill
recent
word
on
a
deal
for
the
bill
suggest
that
the
panel
and
congress
have
been
at
odds
over
exactly
how
to
bring
about
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
millions
of
undocumented
immigrants
with
the
senate
panel
insisting
on
issuing
a
path
to
citizenship
only
after
the
border
is
secure
which
obama
insists
is
important
but
told
univision
that
progress
had
already
been
made
on
tighter
security
at
the
southern
border in
addition
the
aflcio
and
us
chamber
of
commerce
have
been
at
odds
over
the
contentious
issue
of
how
much
immigrant
workers
should
be
paid
the
union
wanting
higher
wages
than
the
chamber
has
agreed
to however
ana
avendano
a
lead
aflcio
negotiator
told
fox
new
latino
wednesday
that
negotiators
for
both
sides
are
back
at
the
table
to
continue
talks
and
are
back
on
the
right
track
