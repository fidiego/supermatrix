for
years
most
local
police
departments
have
resisted
the
idea
of
using
their
officers
to
track
down
illegal
immigrants
reasoning
that
crimefighting
is
better
served
by
building
relationships
of
trust
in
immigrant
communities
now
in
the
wake
of
the
sept
11
attacks
a
growing
number
of
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
country
say
that
they
have
begun
to
equate
immigration
enforcement
with
protecting
national
security
and
that
they
want
to
be
involved
in
the
starkest
example
of
the
turnaround
florida
will
soon
become
the
first
jurisdiction
to
accept
a
longdormant
federal
plan
to
deputize
local
police
officers
as
agents
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
florida
officials
say
they
are
completing
an
agreement
with
the
justice
department
the
immigration
services
parent
authorizing
35
state
troopers
sheriffs
deputies
and
city
police
officers
to
make
an
arrest
solely
for
overstaying
a
visa
or
entering
the
country
illegally
the
immigration
service
which
has
long
concentrated
on
border
control
and
employs
just
1947
agents
for
internal
enforcement
calls
the
new
arrangement
with
florida
revolutionary
and
is
actively
promoting
such
partnerships
with
other
states
the
justice
department
declines
to
identify
any
additional
states
with
which
it
might
be
in
negotiations
although
south
carolinas
attorney
general
charlie
condon
is
backing
a
bill
in
the
state
legislature
to
follow
floridas
lead
the
framework
for
such
agreements
has
been
in
place
since
1996
when
they
were
authorized
in
an
overhaul
of
immigration
laws
a
handful
of
efforts
were
made
then
by
immigrationcontrol
groups
and
local
legislators
around
the
country
to
empower
local
police
officers
to
arrest
illegal
immigrants
all
were
blocked
by
opposition
from
immigrant
groups
and
employers
the
indifference
of
local
law
enforcement
agencies
and
in
some
places
like
new
york
city
strict
laws
or
policies
protecting
otherwise
lawabiding
illegal
immigrants
from
being
turned
over
to
the
immigration
service
but
were
in
a
different
situation
now
said
the
north
miami
beach
police
chief
bill
berger
president
of
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
now
weve
got
a
situation
where
people
feel
truly
fearful
that
we
may
have
people
in
the
country
who
might
want
to
hurt
us
or
kill
us
all
19
hijackers
on
sept
11
were
foreignborn
men
living
in
the
united
states
on
temporary
visas
and
at
least
two
were
in
violation
of
visa
conditions
as
many
as
12
had
lived
briefly
in
florida
which
helps
explain
that
states
eagerness
to
work
with
the
immigration
service
federal
officials
say
the
intent
of
the
partnership
with
florida
is
not
to
storm
immigrant
communities
looking
for
everyone
in
the
country
illegally
but
to
bolster
the
resources
of
the
understaffed
immigration
agency
in
its
search
for
high
priority
illegal
immigrants
short
of
such
formal
agreements
local
police
agencies
have
already
been
drawn
into
immigration
matters
they
once
deemed
too
timeconsuming
or
peripheral
to
their
essential
duties
since
sept
11
for
example
many
have
participated
in
the
governments
antiterrorism
task
forces
hunting
for
middle
eastern
and
muslim
immigrants
who
have
ignored
deportation
orders
a
federal
felony
groups
that
have
long
supported
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigrants
and
the
enlistment
of
state
and
municipal
police
forces
in
the
effort
have
now
renewed
their
campaign
by
framing
it
in
terms
of
fighting
terrorism
islamic
terrorists
have
penetrated
every
aspect
of
our
immigration
system
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
washington
lobby
said
in
a
statement
this
week
but
at
a
time
when
the
foreignborn
population
has
reached
a
historic
high
and
when
an
estimated
eight
million
illegal
immigrants
most
of
them
hispanic
are
spread
across
the
country
others
warn
of
risks
in
using
police
officers
in
the
pursuit
i
dont
think
the
immigrant
community
would
have
confidence
anymore
in
the
police
said
dolly
hassan
an
immigration
lawyer
in
queens
where
a
vast
majority
of
residents
are
foreignborn
or
the
children
of
foreigners
the
police
here
have
always
done
a
tremendous
amount
of
outreach
to
convince
immigrants
that
information
about
their
status
wouldnt
be
shared
so
that
they
will
come
forward
to
report
crimes
since
the
attacks
the
justice
department
has
made
abundant
use
of
immigration
laws
to
arrest
hundreds
of
muslim
men
for
visa
expirations
and
to
hold
them
for
months
as
potential
terrorism
suspects
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
on
the
other
hand
ordinarily
do
not
have
the
power
to
arrest
a
foreigner
for
an
immigration
violation
except
for
ignoring
a
deportation
order
and
the
difference
in
authority
does
not
end
there
immigration
agents
have
wider
latitude
than
even
other
federal
law
enforcement
officers
to
make
arrests
without
a
warrant
and
to
single
out
ethnic
or
national
groups
after
the
terror
attacks
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
also
gave
the
immigration
agency
power
to
detain
indefinitely
without
bringing
charges
any
foreigner
deemed
a
security
risk
a
police
officer
acting
as
a
deputized
immigration
agent
then
would
not
have
to
meet
the
criminal
justice
systems
usual
standard
of
probable
cause
when
arresting
a
foreigner
that
officer
might
be
asked
to
arrest
a
foreigner
who
was
acting
suspiciously
or
was
believed
to
be
an
associate
of
a
terrorist
group
a
senior
justice
department
official
said
someone
you
have
information
about
but
you
dont
have
enough
to
arrest
him
on
under
existing
criminal
law
the
justice
department
has
already
used
immigration
data
to
pursue
those
it
considers
potential
terrorists
and
to
gather
intelligence
and
has
prevailed
upon
local
police
agencies
to
assist
last
year
for
example
the
police
in
many
states
were
asked
to
interview
5000
young
immigrant
men
from
countries
linked
to
terrorism
some
departments
including
three
in
oregon
refused
saying
that
as
they
interpreted
state
privacy
laws
they
were
forbidden
to
question
immigrants
who
were
not
suspected
of
any
crime
some
jurisdictions
prohibit
the
police
and
other
public
employees
from
reporting
illegal
immigrants
to
the
federal
government
in
new
york
city
a
1985
mayoral
executive
order
that
has
since
become
incorporated
into
city
regulations
provides
that
illegal
immigrants
can
be
turned
over
to
the
immigration
service
only
when
they
are
suspected
of
separate
criminal
activity
it
was
designed
so
people
wouldnt
sit
in
their
houses
worrying
about
whether
a
new
york
city
police
officer
is
going
to
come
knocking
on
their
door
because
they
overstayed
their
welcome
said
walter
l
burnes
a
department
spokesman
detective
burnes
said
the
police
department
did
not
now
envision
asking
the
justice
department
to
deputize
its
officers
as
immigration
agents
similarly
spokesmen
for
the
governors
of
new
york
new
jersey
illinois
and
michigan
all
immigrantheavy
states
said
agreements
along
the
florida
model
were
not
under
consideration
still
there
are
signs
that
more
than
ever
before
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
taking
it
on
themselves
to
look
out
for
illegal
immigrants
the
immigration
service
said
queries
from
the
police
to
its
law
enforcement
support
center
which
runs
a
registry
of
foreigners
and
their
legal
status
had
increased
sharply
since
september
to
30000
a
month
from
20000
sheriff
john
cary
bittick
of
forsyth
county
ga
whose
jurisdiction
includes
a
60mile
stretch
of
interstate
highway
that
is
a
favorite
route
for
immigrant
laborers
said
he
would
be
interested
in
having
his
deputies
empowered
to
act
as
immigration
agents
like
anything
else
said
sheriff
bittick
president
of
the
national
sheriffs
association
we
in
law
enforcement
had
to
set
priorities
in
the
past
maybe
immigration
was
not
as
high
a
priority
but
it
will
be
in
the
future
