recognizing
that
most
latinos

was
pleased

the
hardest
work
but
few
recognize
that
i
have
lived
here
for
more
than
20
years
and
the
only
law
i
have
broken
is
the
immigration
law
i
tried
to
come
legally
but
i
was
unable
to
i
decided
to
sacrifice
for
my
family
there
is
a
saying
in
spanish
the
humbler
the
person
the
more
respect
he
should
get

underscoring
the
urgency

the

was
part
of
a
national

opposition
to
passage
by
the
utah

immigration
as
an
asset

enhance
that
potential
for
individual
human
beings
businesses
and
society
this

not
a
time
for
timidity
