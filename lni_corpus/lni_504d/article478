a
littlenoticed
provision
in
the
counterterrorism
bill
approved
by
congress
would
drastically
reduce
the
rights
and
protections
of
aliens
with
claims
to
remain
in
the
united
states
civil
rights
advocates
said
today
under
the
bill
people
who
say
they
are
fleeing
persecution
and
who
arrive
in
the
united
states
without
valid
travel
documents
would
have
their
asylum
claims
decided
by
a
single
immigration
and
naturalization
service
border
officer
current
law
requires
a
hearing
before
an
immigration
judge
in
1995
3287
asylumseekers
arrived
without
valid
documents
immigration
experts
said
in
addition
the
provision
says
anyone
who
has
illegally
entered
the
united
states
in
the
past
may
be
summarily
deported
without
judicial
review
currently
these
immigrants
are
entitled
to
a
deportation
hearing
which
guarantees
constitutional
rights
like
legal
representation
and
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
to
show
why
the
alien
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
country
this
change
could
theoretically
affect
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigrants
including
those
who
had
lived
here
for
years
married
american
citizens
or
had
children
who
are
citizens
last
year
alone
about
80
percent
of
the
110000
cases
that
immigration
judges
decided
involved
people
who
faced
deportation
for
being
in
the
country
illegally
under
the
bill
the
fate
of
these
aliens
would
rest
with
an
immigration
officer
the
bills
provisions
are
a
radical
restructuring
of
the
immigration
laws
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
terrorism
and
go
far
beyond
anything
in
the
immigration
bills
now
being
considered
by
congress
said
lucas
guttentag
director
of
the
immigrants
rights
project
at
the
american
civil
liberties
union
the
house
today
approved
the
bill
by
a
vote
of
293
to
133
joining
the
senate
which
passed
the
legislation
on
wednesday
by
a
vote
of
91
to
8
president
clinton
has
promised
to
sign
the
legislation
in
time
for
the
anniversary
on
friday
of
the
bombing
of
the
federal
building
in
oklahoma
city
with
this
version
were
facing
really
major
changes
in
the
way
we
and
the
immigration
courts
do
business
said
david
a
martin
the
general
counsel
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
the
immigration
service
and
civil
rights
groups
were
caught
off
guard
this
week
by
the
immigration
provisions
included
in
the
antiterrorism
bill
and
were
trying
to
assess
its
consequences
mr
martin
said
the
administration
would
try
to
amend
the
immigration
bill
now
before
the
senate
to
modify
the
provisions
in
the
antiterrorism
legislation
both
the
immigration
bill
the
house
approved
last
month
and
the
legislation
before
the
senate
include
provisions
similar
to
the
terrorism
bill
regarding
the
exclusion
of
asylum
seekers
but
neither
bill
goes
as
far
as
the
counterterrorism
bill
to
deny
aliens
already
in
the
united
states
the
right
to
hearings
before
an
immigration
judge
senator
patrick
j
leahy
democrat
of
vermont
unsuccessfully
tried
to
strike
the
immigration
provisions
from
the
counterterrorism
bill
on
wednesday
and
is
vowing
to
try
again
when
the
senate
takes
up
its
immigration
bill
in
the
next
few
days
there
are
some
circumstances
and
oppressive
regimes
in
the
world
where
if
you
are
going
to
escape
you
may
well
need
to
rely
on
false
papers
mr
leahy
said
on
wednesday
one
congressional
advocate
for
immigrants
cited
as
an
example
inez
l
a
21yearold
woman
who
fled
el
salvador
in
the
late
1980s
after
her
parents
and
uncle
had
been
killed
she
entered
the
united
states
illegally
with
a
cousin
but
was
allowed
to
stay
as
a
housekeeper
in
maryland
under
a
program
that
granted
temporary
protection
to
refugees
from
el
salvador
and
guatemala
inez
married
and
had
twin
girls
but
recently
she
and
her
husband
separated
and
her
work
permit
expires
later
this
month
under
the
counterterrorism
bills
provisions
the
ins
could
be
required
to
separate
inez
from
her
children
and
send
her
back
to
el
salvador
without
any
hearing
immigration
experts
familiar
with
her
case
said
the
potential
is
that
all
kinds
of
people
who
have
a
nebulous
legal
status
would
be
deprived
of
existing
immigration
procedures
as
well
as
technical
forms
of
relief
said
carol
wolchok
director
of
the
american
bar
associations
center
for
immigration
law
and
representation
in
washington
currently
immigrants
who
have
been
in
the
united
states
illegally
more
than
seven
years
can
appeal
to
have
their
deportation
suspended
if
they
demonstrate
strong
family
or
employment
ties
why
are
we
legislating
against
refugees
in
a
terrorism
bill
asked
robert
rubin
assistant
director
in
san
francisco
for
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
they
are
not
terrorists
they
are
