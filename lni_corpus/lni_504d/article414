the
clinton
administration
is
trying
to
find
out
whether
a
database
that
would
list
all
eligible
us
workers
as
recommended
by
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
is
advisable
or
even
possible
the
bipartisan
commission
reported
to
congress
friday
that
a
database
employers
could
use
to
confirm
the
status
of
job
applicants
is
crucial
to
stemming
the
flood
of
illegal
immigrants
to
the
usa
the
proposed
employee
database
would
someday
allow
an
employer
to
dial
a
phone
number
punch
in
a
social
security
number
or
personal
security
code
and
verify
that
a
job
applicant
is
eligible
to
work
in
the
usa
but
susan
martin
executive
director
of
the
commission
that
prepared
the
report
says
the
registry
is
a
hotbutton
issue
before
the
commission
had
a
chance
to
meet
with
clinton
administration
officials
headlines
declared
the
database
criticized
as
a
big
brotherlike
invasion
of
privacy
as
already
dead
white
house
officials
say
the
database
idea
is
welcome
but
not
yet
possible
because
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
databases
are
in
disarray
those
databases
are
not
accurate
and
are
not
state
of
the
art
says
ginny
terzano
a
white
house
spokeswoman
a
lot
of
improvement
is
necessary
we
are
putting
resources
into
this
project
the
crime
bill
added
154
million
to
the
ins
technology
budget
raising
it
to
254
million
the
agency
may
get
an
additional
300
million
over
the
next
five
years
through
the
crime
bill
we
have
an
ambitious
program
under
way
to
upgrade
the
ins
databases
that
support
employer
verification
says
ins
commissioner
doris
meissner
the
ins
has
been
plagued
by
database
problems
in
august
the
american
civil
liberties
union
sued
the
ins
claiming
applicants
were
denied
jobs
because
ins
lost
60000
files
the
ins
failed
to
enter
data
and
then
when
it
does
it
is
so
inaccurate
that
it
is
impossible
to
locate
the
people
says
aclu
lawyer
lucas
guttentag
inss
track
record
is
very
clear
it
is
incapable
of
entering
and
updating
data
he
says
a
national
registry
system
using
ins
computer
data
is
bound
to
fail
but
says
martin
we
have
a
commitment
from
the
ins
to
improve
its
data
as
commission
staffers
meet
this
week
with
clinton
officials
to
establish
pilot
programs
in
some
states
both
sides
say
they
will
be
looking
to
learn
exactly
what
is
needed
for
a
national
registry
existing
pilot
programs
using
a
telephoneaccessed
database
in
california
florida
illinois
new
york
and
texas
will
expand
next
year
terzano
says
the
tests
will
be
done
with
an
eye
toward
the
national
system
before
you
go
top
speed
you
have
to
make
sure
youre
ready
when
an
engineer
is
designing
a
car
it
goes
through
several
tests
before
coming
off
an
assembly
line
commission
chairwoman
barbara
jordon
says
some
people
apparently
fear
the
government
will
have
too
much
information
i
would
hope
that
congress
spends
the
money
necessary
to
correct
the
data
that
is
kept
by
social
securityins
the
government
needs
good
data
too
melvin
straus
chairman
of
the
el
paso
branch
of
the
aclu
says
the
registry
is
just
a
bad
idea
there
is
no
compelling
interest
either
national
or
state
for
the
government
to
know
the
backgrounds
of
everyone
thats
an
invasion
of
privacy
the
right
not
to
be
bothered
and
the
right
to
be
left
alone
should
be
primary
