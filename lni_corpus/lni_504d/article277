the
latest
immigration
bill
approved
by
the
senate
is
far
far
worse
than
the
1986
immigration
bill
that
granted
amnesty
to
27
million
illegal
aliens
and
created
the
magnet
for
the
millions
more
who
have
come
here
since
a
house
panel
was
told
at
a
hearing
yesterday
in
addition
to
providing
legalization
to
about
four
times
as
many
illegal
aliens
as
did
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
irca
witnesses
said
the
current
bill
also
repeats
mistakes
made
20
years
ago
that
will
render
the
borderenforcement
provisions
and
employer
sanctions
meaningless
the
senate
amnesty
would
condemn
the
united
states
to
the
same
harmful
consequences
that
irca
caused
james
r
edwards
jr
of
the
hudson
institute
told
the
house
judiciarys
subcommittee
that
handles
immigration
only
now
its
effects
would
be
far
far
worse
rep
john
hostettler
the
indiana
republican
who
is
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
immigration
border
security
and
claims
said
the
problem
with
the
1986
legislation
was
that
it
allowed
legalization
before
measures
were
put
in
place
to
enforce
immigration
restrictions
and
punish
those
who
violated
immigration
laws
time
showed
us
that
irca
has
utterly
and
completely
failed
he
said
illegal
immigration
has
not
been
controlled
but
has
increased
significantly
in
the
past
two
decades
democrats
on
the
panel
for
the
most
part
criticized
republicans
for
holding
what
they
called
a
mock
hearing
and
accused
them
of
trying
to
score
political
points
off
the
explosive
issue
just
months
before
the
next
election
rep
sheila
jacksonlee
of
texas
ranking
democrat
on
the
subcommittee
said
the
reason
the
1986
bill
did
not
work
is
that
it
was
not
comprehensive
enough
a
criticism
she
also
leveled
at
the
enforcementonly
bill
approved
by
the
house
last
year
although
irca
had
legalization
programs
and
new
enforcement
measures
it
did
not
address
all
of
the
essential
issues
she
said
for
instance
it
failed
to
provide
enough
legal
visas
to
meet
future
immigration
needs
mrs
jacksonlee
also
castigated
republicans
for
smearing
the
senate
bill
with
the
term
amnesty
because
it
will
grant
citizenship
rights
to
some
10
million
illegal
aliens
already
here
it
was
derived
from
the
latin
word
amnesti
which
means
amnesia
she
said
after
giving
the
definition
s2611
does
not
have
any
provisions
that
would
forget
or
overlook
immigration
law
violations
replied
rep
steve
king
iowa
republican
i
dont
care
what
we
call
it
its
a
bad
bill
and
america
knows
its
a
bad
bill
though
republicans
repeatedly
referred
to
the
bill
as
reidkennedy
for
sens
harry
reid
and
edward
m
kennedy
democrats
noted
that
the
legislation
has
broad
support
among
senate
republicans
including
majority
leader
bill
frist
president
bush
also
has
been
highly
supportive
of
the
bill
michael
jackson
deputy
secretary
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
said
mr
bush
is
committed
to
a
threepronged
approach
to
immigration
reform
he
wants
to
strengthen
the
border
enhance
interior
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
and
create
a
temporaryworker
program
asked
whether
this
election
year
is
causing
problems
for
the
white
house
in
making
their
case
mr
jackson
replied
there
is
a
lot
of
focus
on
gaining
control
of
the
border
this
year
and
we
welcome
that
rep
silvestre
reyes
a
texas
democrat
who
served
26
years
in
the
border
patrol
was
among
those
who
testified
yesterday
he
accused
mr
bush
and
republicans
in
congress
of
wasting
time
with
the
hearings
talk
is
cheap
he
said
what
border
residents
want
and
what
americans
want
when
it
comes
to
border
security
and
immigration
reform
is
action
but
mr
hostettler
warned
that
action
without
consideration
for
the
mistakes
of
1986
will
only
create
a
bigger
problem
in
the
decades
to
come
congress
and
the
administration
have
no
credibility
with
the
american
people
he
said
why
should
americans
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
supposed
enhanced
enforcement
provisions
in
reidkennedy
will
be
effectively
enforced
by
the
administration
any
more
than
successive
administrations
have
enforced
irca
mr
hostettler
asked
the
administration
will
probably
implement
amnesty
for
millions
of
illegal
aliens
quite
quickly
enforcement
will
likely
lag
behind
if
it
occurs
at
all
we
will
find
ourselves
in
exactly
the
same
place
we
found
ourselves
