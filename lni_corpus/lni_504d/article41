the
desperate
desire
to
obtain
legal
status
combines
with
tangled
us
immigration
laws
to
create
a
climate
that
invites
deceit
and
fraud
for
perpetrators
the
risk
of
defrauding
immigrants
is
small
because
the
victims
are
reluctant
to
complain
the
amounts
immigration
consultants
can
make
off
their
prey
are
limited
only
by
their
nefarious
ambitions
the
last
thing
someone
whose
immigration
status
may
be
dubious
wants
to
do
is
attract
official
attention
the
money
unscrupulous
immigration
consultants
can
make
far
outweighs
the
limited
risk
but
that
could
change
the
texas
attorney
general
is
becoming
increasingly
aggressive
in
chasing
perpetrators
of
fraud
federal
legislation
that
would
impose
criminal
penalties
for
immigration
scams
has
been
introduced
at
the
moment
however
there
is
no
national
standard
for
pursuing
fraud
in
texas
the
attorney
generals
office
targets
suspected
scammers
and
recently
got
a
settlement
against
an
organization
whose
clients
complained
did
them
more
harm
than
good
cristo
vive
christ
lives
a
secular
organization
that
offered
immigration
consulting
collected
fees
ranging
from
232000
to
619000
annually
but
is
now
out
of
the
immigration
business
as
the
americanstatesmans
jeremy
schwartz
reported
this
week
the
organization
and
its
owner
jorge
sanchez
must
comply
with
a
court
order
that
bars
him
from
collecting
money
for
immigration
work
and
from
using
the
name
cristo
vive
sanchez
and
cristo
vive
were
targeted
by
the
texas
attorney
generals
office
in
2012
after
a
2011
americanstatesman
report
that
immigration
cases
handled
by
sanchez
and
his
organization
were
bungled
so
badly
that
his
clients
faced
arrest
and
deportation
sanchez
agreed
to
a
court
order
to
pay
250000
in
restitution
and
faces
a
300000
fine
if
he
violates
terms
of
the
settlement
with
state
authorities
the
settlement
reached
between
sanchez
and
the
state
is
the
result
of
a
civil
case
not
criminal
action
this
case
is
far
from
isolated
immigration
consultants
flourish
often
implying
that
they
are
legally
qualified
to
handle
immigration
cases
when
they
are
not
clients
often
are
charged
for
immigration
forms
that
are
free
and
thats
just
the
beginning
of
a
long
ripoff
that
could
lead
to
even
bigger
legal
problems
for
them
the
texas
attorney
generals
office
has
gotten
increasingly
aggressive
in
cracking
down
on
immigration
scams
closing
down
75
unauthorized
immigration
consultants
across
the
state
while
commendable
shutting
down
fraudulent
and
unscrupulous
operators
is
going
to
take
a
while
the
customer
base
is
large
and
either
unaware
or
downright
afraid
of
seeking
recourse
bear
in
mind
those
customers
are
seeking
the
help
to
obtain
legal
status
in
the
united
states
they
are
vulnerable
because
the
notarios
literally
notary
who
advertise
their
services
are
often
cheaper
than
lawyers
who
specialize
in
immigration
law
a
notario
in
some
latin
american
countries
is
a
stateappointed
attorney
in
the
us
of
course
a
notary
public
is
someone
who
acts
as
a
legal
witness
at
document
signings
a
notario
on
this
side
of
the
border
can
make
false
promises
about
speeding
up
the
process
and
guaranteeing
an
outcome
and
continue
to
collect
money
from
the
hapless
clients
who
invest
hope
in
them
this
is
a
foreseeable
problem
noted
us
rep
bill
foster
dill
foster
introduced
legislation
that
would
make
it
a
federal
crime
to
fraudulently
offer
immigration
legal
services
the
bill
calls
for
a
fine
and
up
to
10
to
15
years
in
federal
prison
for
offenders
not
only
do
these
notarios
exploit
immigrants
for
money
but
their
false
services
can
and
many
times
have
resulted
in
wellmeaning
immigrants
being
deported
because
they
didnt
receive
accurate
information
on
the
immigration
process
foster
said
its
federal
legislation
that
merits
support
even
if
the
current
attempt
at
immigration
reform
fizzles
perhaps
especially
if
it
fizzles
immigrants
seeking
to
legally
navigate
a
complicated
process
deserve
the
protection
these
are
people
who
are
trying
to
play
by
the
rules
after
all
but
could
have
their
opportunity
for
legal
status
compromised
by
fraudulent
advice
rendered
by
unscrupulous
con
artists
the
california
legislature
is
also
seeking
to
crack
down
on
fraudulent
immigration
consultants
criminalizing
this
type
of
fraud
deserves
the
attention
of
the
texas
legislature
as
well
but
the
next
regular
session
is
a
year
and
three
months
away
back
in
central
texas
sanchezs
lawyer
said
his
client
agreed
to
the
settlement
because
he
was
tired
of
fighting
the
state
ed
watt
of
dripping
springs
blamed
sanchezs
legal
problems
on
those
who
opposed
the
competition
at
lower
rates
its
an
explanation
that
invites
skepticism
especially
from
sanchezs
aggrieved
clientele
a
former
cristo
vive
client
told
the
americanstatesman
in
2011
that
sanchez
advised
him
to
seek
a
religious
worker
visa
instead
of
applying
for
political
asylum
because
of
threats
he
had
received
in
his
native
colombia
it
was
advice
that
nearly
got
him
deported
its
as
if
i
came
with
cancer
and
he
injected
me
with
malaria
