a
recently
formed
coalition
of
immigrant
advocates
is
scrutinizing
a
controversial
federal
program
that
checks
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
booked
into
jail
secure
communities
a
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
program
that
uses
an
automated
system
to
speed
up
immigration
checks
is
scheduled
to
be
deployed
in
santa
cruz
county
in
august
the
program
represents
a
dramatic
shift
in
immigration
enforcement
and
its
being
implemented
quietly
without
community
input
said
isaac
menashe
an
analyst
with
the
california
immigrant
policy
centers
oakland
office
menshe
spoke
at
a
coalition
meeting
friday
at
the
community
information
center
for
migrant
assistance
at
the
lutheran
community
church
menshe
said
while
officials
stress
catching
violent
criminals
the
program
is
casting
a
wider
net
and
through
the
criminal
justice
system
more
and
more
people
are
entering
the
immigration
system
under
the
program
a
traffic
stop
for
a
burnedout
tail
light
could
escalate
into
deportation
if
the
driver
couldnt
produce
identification
and
was
arrested
menshe
said
federal
immigration
and
local
law
enforcement
officials
tout
the
new
program
as
a
more
efficient
tool
to
track
someones
criminal
record
but
it
also
looks
at
immigration
status
and
menshe
said
as
the
local
police
role
in
immigration
enforcement
increases
trust
and
cooperation
will
erode
in
immigrant
communities
potentially
degrading
public
safety
he
said
theres
no
federal
law
mandating
the
program
and
communities
should
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
to
participate
doug
keegan
director
of
the
santa
cruz
county
immigration
project
said
the
coalition
took
no
action
in
response
to
the
presentation
about
a
dozen
people
attended
the
meeting
including
santa
cruz
councilman
tony
madrigal
santa
cruz
council
candidate
david
foster
and
a
representative
from
the
office
of
rep
sam
farr
dcarmel
as
well
as
immigrant
advocates
and
immigration
attorneys
keegan
said
the
group
formed
in
june
to
organize
free
immigration
workshops
in
the
fall
but
could
take
on
other
issues
keegan
said
before
the
sentinel
published
an
article
about
the
program
wednesday
few
were
aware
of
secure
communities
its
helpful
to
have
a
group
like
this
when
issues
arise
