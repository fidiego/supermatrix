guadalupe
gonzalez
is
the
chief
counsel
for
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
in
el
paso
a
lawyer
with
more
than
20
years
of
experience
in
immigration
law
and
a
stellar
record
in
2002
she
made
the
next
logical
career
move
she
applied
to
become
an
immigration
judge
i
love
el
paso
it
is
my
homei
was
born
and
raised
here
and
its
important
for
me
personally
to
contribute
in
a
role
that
is
both
vitally
important
to
our
country
and
of
particular
importance
to
the
el
paso
community
she
said
but
the
job
went
to
a
white
male
candidate
with
no
reported
immigration
experience
in
2004
when
two
other
judgeships
opened
they
went
to
two
other
white
males
both
of
them
gonzalezs
subordinates
with
markedly
less
expertise
in
immigration
law
than
gonzalez
gonzalez
56
sued
the
attorney
general
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
national
origin
and
the
suit
is
pending
in
a
washington
dc
court
in
her
filings
gonzalez
claimed
that
since
2001
only
two
hispanics
were
appointed
nationwide
for
40
immigration
judgeships
the
four
immigration
judges
in
el
paso
are
all
white
men
the
case
has
attracted
national
attention
amid
a
scandal
over
the
apparent
politicization
of
attorney
general
positions
and
judgeships
last
year
the
department
of
justice
fired
eight
us
attorneys
prompting
congressional
hearings
this
month
an
analysis
by
the
washington
post
found
that
at
least
onethird
of
the
immigration
judges
appointed
since
2004
have
had
republican
connections
or
have
been
administration
insiders
and
half
lacked
experience
in
immigration
law
bill
day
gonzalezs
lawyer
in
washington
dc
said
that
while
his
client
does
not
allege
that
the
departments
selection
of
judges
in
her
case
was
politically
motivated
there
is
a
common
thread
between
the
cases
the
attitude
of
the
department
of
justice
was
that
the
rules
did
not
apply
to
them
day
said
department
of
justice
officials
said
they
could
not
comment
on
the
pending
gonzalez
lawsuit
but
defended
their
hiring
practices
immigration
judges
appointed
during
this
administration
were
well
qualified
for
their
current
positions
said
department
spokesman
dean
boyd
in
washington
dc
the
department
does
not
exclude
from
consideration
those
without
immigration
experience
but
does
consider
immigration
law
experience
as
a
factor
in
hiring
immigration
judges
the
department
of
justice
changed
its
hiring
process
for
immigration
judges
in
april
vacancy
announcements
are
now
posted
online
and
applications
are
reviewed
by
a
panel
it
also
now
requires
that
newly
appointed
immigration
judges
pass
an
exam
on
immigration
law
department
officials
said
the
changes
were
motivated
by
reports
of
immigration
judges
failing
to
display
temperament
and
produce
work
that
meets
the
departments
standards
an
official
statement
read
the
more
than
200
immigration
judges
in
the
united
states
decide
the
fate
of
more
than
300000
immigrants
each
year
including
whom
to
deport
and
whom
to
grant
asylum
to
the
judges
rule
alone
and
appeal
rights
are
limited
immigration
experts
said
that
immigration
law
is
a
complicated
matter
with
the
intricacy
level
of
tax
law
the
political
leanings
of
an
applicant
for
an
immigration
judge
position
really
should
be
irrelevant
said
kathleen
walker
of
el
paso
presidentelect
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
there
should
be
a
focus
on
hiring
those
with
immigration
law
expertise
for
these
positions
whether
from
government
service
or
from
the
private
sector
in
gonzalezs
case
the
department
bypassed
the
competitive
hiring
process
by
using
the
attorney
generals
direct
appointment
authority
in
2002
gonzalez
did
apply
for
a
posted
immigration
judge
position
which
went
to
richard
ozmun
a
retired
us
navy
lawyer
but
in
2004
two
other
vacancies
were
never
posted
and
gonzalez
was
not
contacted
for
an
interview
even
though
she
had
previously
expressed
interest
in
becoming
an
immigration
judge
these
positions
went
to
robert
hough
assistant
chief
counsel
at
ice
under
the
direct
supervision
of
gonzalez
and
thomas
roepke
a
special
assistant
us
attorney
for
ice
the
government
tried
to
have
gonzalezs
case
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
since
gonzalez
did
not
actually
apply
for
the
positions
she
did
not
know
were
open
it
was
not
possible
for
her
to
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
selection
process
but
a
washington
dc
judge
denied
the
motion
last
year
saying
that
the
agency
could
no
more
discriminate
in
their
direct
appointments
than
in
more
competitive
settings
gonzalez
judge
emmet
g
sullivan
wrote
had
identified
a
particular
policy
that
has
a
discriminatory
effect
on
a
particular
group
the
attorney
generals
direct
appointment
authority
the
suit
asks
for
gonzalez
to
get
an
immigration
judge
position
back
pay
and
compensatory
damages
an
immigration
judge
in
el
paso
makes
between
112633
and
148031
a
year
gonzalezs
lawyer
said
in
light
of
all
the
wrongdoing
this
case
has
uncovered
the
department
of
justice
should
have
settled
this
case
a
long
time
ago
now
it
looks
as
though
theyll
have
to
pay
the
price
at
trial
day
said
being
mexican
american
should
not
disqualify
a
talented
and
experienced
lawyer
from
being
an
immigration
judge
