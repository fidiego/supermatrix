a
littlenoticed
provision
in
two
key
senate
immigration
bills
would
reshape
the
handling
of
immigration
appeals
cases
and
has
touched
off
an
outcry
from
several
legal
scholars
federal
judges
and
the
policymaking
group
for
the
federal
courts
the
measure
would
designate
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
here
an
administrative
court
that
focuses
primarily
on
patent
cases
and
currently
handles
no
immigration
appeals
as
the
only
court
in
the
nation
to
handle
immigration
appeals
such
appeals
are
currently
shared
by
the
12
other
federal
appellate
courts
the
judges
and
scholars
say
that
the
circuit
court
in
washington
which
handles
about
1500
nonimmigration
cases
a
year
would
be
swamped
by
an
additional
12000
immigration
cases
and
they
say
that
the
court
lacks
the
expertise
to
handle
complex
immigration
cases
which
often
raise
a
host
of
constitutional
and
humanrights
issues
the
question
of
how
these
cases
are
handled
is
particularly
sensitive
because
federal
appeals
judges
have
sharply
criticized
what
they
have
described
as
a
pattern
of
biased
and
incoherent
decisions
from
immigration
judges
in
asylum
cases
which
make
up
the
bulk
of
immigration
appeals
the
two
bills
one
by
senator
arlen
specter
republican
of
pennsylvania
and
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
the
other
by
senator
bill
frist
republican
of
tennessee
and
the
majority
leader
were
intended
in
part
to
ease
the
burden
on
the
nations
federal
appeals
courts
which
have
had
a
sharp
increase
in
immigration
cases
the
provisions
may
come
up
for
a
vote
in
the
senate
as
early
as
next
week
judiciary
committee
staff
members
said
that
designating
a
single
court
to
handle
the
cases
would
ensure
a
consistent
standard
for
immigration
decisions
and
discourage
immigrants
from
shopping
for
favorable
courts
they
said
that
immigration
lawyers
would
also
be
assigned
to
the
court
to
help
enhance
expertise
and
that
the
number
of
judges
would
be
increased
to
15
from
12
youre
trying
to
avoid
forum
shopping
and
trying
to
create
a
uniform
national
policy
for
immigration
said
a
senior
aide
to
mr
specter
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
details
of
the
legislation
were
still
being
negotiated
but
richard
a
posner
a
prominent
federal
appeals
judge
in
chicago
said
the
measures
were
not
a
sound
solution
even
with
the
three
additional
judges
judge
posner
said
the
annual
caseload
would
surge
to
900
per
judge
from
125
i
cannot
think
of
an
area
of
law
that
is
more
remote
from
immigration
than
patents
the
judge
wrote
to
senator
richard
j
durbin
an
illinois
democrat
on
the
judiciary
committee
no
doubt
the
judges
of
the
federal
circuit
can
become
knowledgeable
about
immigration
law
but
they
will
be
overwhelmed
by
the
new
caseload
leonidas
ralph
mecham
secretary
for
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
a
group
of
judges
who
make
policy
for
the
federal
courts
and
who
present
the
judiciarys
views
to
congress
raised
similar
concerns
no
sufficient
justification
to
support
changing
the
status
quo
and
shifting
these
cases
from
the
regional
courts
to
the
federal
circuit
has
been
provided
mr
mecham
wrote
to
mr
specter
the
judges
also
raised
concerns
about
a
proposal
that
would
appoint
a
single
judge
to
decide
whether
immigration
cases
were
worthy
of
consideration
for
appeal
if
the
judge
declined
the
case
no
further
review
would
be
available
mr
durbin
said
he
planned
to
offer
an
amendment
that
would
kill
the
measures
telling
his
colleagues
on
the
judiciary
committee
that
it
would
be
premature
to
make
such
changes
before
holding
hearings
but
the
senior
aide
to
mr
specter
strongly
defended
the
measure
noting
that
the
federal
circuit
would
have
fewer
cases
than
many
of
the
federal
appeals
circuits
even
with
the
additional
workload
he
also
pointed
out
that
most
of
the
federal
circuits
judges
were
generalists
not
specialists
before
they
were
appointed
the
surge
in
immigration
appeals
occurred
after
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
made
changes
in
2002
to
streamline
appellate
review
within
the
immigration
courts
many
appellate
judges
say
those
changes
essentially
shifted
work
to
them
immigration
cases
accounted
for
about
17
percent
of
all
federal
appeals
cases
last
year
up
from
3
percent
in
2001
in
new
york
and
california
nearly
40
percent
of
federal
appeals
involved
immigration
critics
of
the
new
legislation
say
that
shifting
appeals
to
washington
is
misdirected
and
that
a
better
solution
would
be
to
add
resources
to
the
overstrapped
local
immigration
courts
and
to
an
interimlevel
immigration
appeals
court
known
as
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
they
said
proposed
increases
in
financing
were
inadequate
leaving
immigration
judges
overburdened
and
threatening
immigrants
rights
to
federal
review
congress
needs
to
address
the
virtual
collapse
of
the
immigration
judge
and
appeals
system
not
deny
immigrants
a
chance
to
have
their
day
in
federal
court
said
lucas
guttentag
director
of
the
american
civil
liberties
unions
immigrant
rights
project
the
american
intellectual
property
law
association
which
represents
16000
lawyers
also
objects
to
the
change
saying
the
caseload
increase
would
hurt
the
way
patent
cases
are
handled
