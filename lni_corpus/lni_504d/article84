by

marrero
palgrave
macmillan
27
in
1987
one
of
pilar
marreros
first
assignments
as
a
journalist
focused
on
the
1986
immigration
and
control
act
this
statute
was
intended
to
amnesty
3
million
illegal
immigrants
while
preventing
future
illegal
immigration
as
she
notes
only
the
first
objective
was
met
illegal
immigration
persisted
and
proliferated
over
the
intervening
decades
with
an
eye
on
the
past
ms
marrero
discusses
the
benefits
of
illegal
immigration
in
killing
the
american
dream
she
finds
it
fills
jobs
americans
wont
do
and
it
lowers
the
price
for
consumer
goods
she
considers
enforcement
efforts
against
illegal
immigration
to
be
not
only
counterproductive
but
futile
because
willing
and
desperate
employees
will
always
beat
an
inexorable
path
to
willing
and
costcutting
employers
while
identifying
ineffective
strategies
in
the
nations
struggle
with
illegal
immigration
the
author
mentions
the
socalled
section
287g
collaborations
between
local
and
federal
law
enforcement
californias
and
arizonas
propositions
denying
public
benefits

illegal

ms
marrero
an
editor
and
reporter
for
the
spanishlanguage
daily
la
opinion
finds
immigration
to
be
an
extremely
controversial
topic
and
the
system
is
dysfunctional
she
laments
that
since
the
mid1990s
it
has
been
impossible
to
have
a
reasonable
discussion
on
the
issue
the
highly
volatile
complex
issue
offers
few
rewards
to
any
politicians
who
decide
to
address
it
as
comprehensively
and
honestly
as
it
merits
she
expresses
hope
for
the
nation
to
someday
engage
in
a
detailed
analysis
killing
the
american
dream
however
offers
no
criteria
by
which
a
national
policy
might
determine
the
optimum
level
of
immigration
in
light
of
jobs
the
environment
resources
or
the
means
to
provide
public
assistance
on
a
planet
experiencing
a
daily
net
population
gain
of
331000
births
minus
deaths
essentially
another
pittsburgh
daily
the
need
to
foster
a
detailed
analysis
on
the
optimum
level
of
immigration
is
destined
to
rise
in
prominence
the
author
seems
content
to
allow
this
national
policy
to
be
determined
by
prevailing
migration
patterns
she
discredits
any
attempt
to
address
the
level
of
immigration
as
hateful
to
this
extent
the
book
seemingly
undermines
the
authors
aspiration
for
a
reasonable
discussion
the
national
policy
in
establishing
a
nondiscriminatory
sustainable
level
of
immigration
will
be
enhanced
by
dignified
communications
and
mutual
respect
not
everyone
at
the
table
is
filled
with
hate
the
author
offers
no
insight
why
for
example
47
percent
of
hispanics
supported
arizonas
prop
200
denying
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
in
cnns
exit
poll
she
fails
to
explain
why
during
clintons
administration
the
barbara
jordan
immigration
commission
called
for
an
end
to
illegal
immigration
and
for
substantially
reduced
levels
of
legal
immigration
she
offers
no
insight
on
why
an
april
2012
poll
by
dallasbased
pulse
opinion
research
revealed
only
10
percent
of
us
voters
approve
the
current
rate
of
population
growth
which
according
to
the
us
census
bureau
will
double
us
population
from
313
million
as
of
april
to
more
than
600
million
by
the
end
of
the
century
she
makes
no
attempt
to
explain
why
recent
immigrants
minorities
underprivileged
and
others
would
have
concerns
over
the
nations
anticipated
40
percent
population
increase
in
less
than
40
years
is
there
too
little
congestion
too
much
unfilled
landfill
space
are
jobs
too
plentiful
wages
too
high
is
water
in
the
parched
south
too
abundant
access
to
credible
projections
and
worrisome
trends
often
outpaces
our
ability
to
responsibly
process
the
information
the
human
act
of
data
gathering
and
prediction
is
not
always
a
common
enterprise
this
book
becomes
a
case
study
on
how
these
variables
can
nurture
a
bias
the
aspiration
to
convene
a
reasonable
discussion
might
begin
by
formulating
a
criteria
for
the
level
of
immigration
in
a
nation
which
as
the
author
observes
continues
to
welcome
more
legal
immigrants
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
imputing
detestable
motives
to
anyone
weighing
into
the
conversation
will
not
advance
a
reasonable
discussion
killing
the
american
dream
capably
lays
out
the
claims
of
open
border
advocates
if
however
you
seek
substantive
information
on
ethical
criteria
in
formulating
a
longrange
sustainable
immigration
policy
you
may
have
to
keep
looking
beyond
the
four
corners
