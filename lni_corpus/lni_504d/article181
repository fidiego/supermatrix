after
healthcare
reform
is
immigration
reform
achievable
many
say
arizonas
stringent
new
law
demands
immigration
reform
from
washington
but
congress
may
not
be
ready
for
another
political
showdown

immigration
reform
is
a
steep
climb
under
the
best
of
circumstances
the
last
president
to
sign
a
major
overhaul
was
ronald
reagan
in
1986
and
now
with
washington
as
deeply
polarized
as
it
is
and
in
the
thick
of
a
midterm
election
campaign
getting
anywhere
becomes
wellnigh
impossible
that
still
has
not
stopped
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
d
of
nevada
from
trying
to
keep
alive
efforts
to
bring
an
immigration
overhaul
to
a
vote
this
year
senate
democrats
unveiled
a
new
proposal
for
reform
late
last
week
stressing
security
first
then
a
pathway
to
legalization
for
the
estimated
108
million
people
in
the
country
illegally
the
democrats
were
making
a
longshot
effort
to
attract
republican
support
but
none
was
forthcoming
and
the
issue
has
receded
in
washington
as
the
gulf
of
mexico
oil
slick
and
the
failed
times
square
car
bomb
attack
consume
attention
but
for
senator
reid
immigration
remains
a
top
political
concern
he
is
embroiled
in
a
tough
reelection
battle
and
he
needs
the
support
of
nevadas
large
hispanic
population
20
percent
of
the
state
arizonas
tough
new
antiillegal
immigration
law
which
requires
police
officers
to
check
a
persons
immigration
status
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
in
the
united
states
illegally
has
added
urgency
to
the
calls
for
federal
reform
critics
including
president
obama
fear
the
law
could
lead
to
racial
profiling
but
the
president
sounds
doubtful
that
a
comprehensive
reform
that
addresses
both
border
security
and
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
can
be
finished
this
year
weve
gone
through
a
very
tough
year
and
ive
been
working
congress
pretty
hard
mr
obama
told
reporters
on
air
force
one
april
28
so
i
know
there
may
not
be
an
appetite
immediately
to
dive
into
another
controversial
issue
why
has
fixing
an
immigration
system
widely
seen
as
broken
been
so
hard
to
achieve
in
some
ways
analysts
say
its
like
healthcare
reform
there
are
many
elements
and
constituencies
with
welldrawn
battle
lines
after
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
failed
to
deliver
on
its
promise
a
loss
of
trust
ensued
making
subsequent
reform
even
more
difficult
to
pursue
and
as
with
health
reform
it
will
take
major
presidential
and
congressional
muscle
to
achieve
success
immigration
brings
up
very
intense
emotions
for
people
even
conflicting
emotions
says
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
americas
voice
an
immigration
advocacy
group
people
who
are
close
to
the
immigrant
experience
feel
a
sense
of
outrage
that
most
americans
dont
understand
that
most
immigrants
are
really
good
people
who
work
really
hard
and
really
want
to
be
american
mr
sharry
adds
on
the
other
side
there
are
people
who
feel
really
strongly
and
outraged
they
feel
the
country
its
sovereignty
and
its
culture
are
threatened
by
immigration
in
general
and
in
particular
illegal
immigration
then
theres
the
vast
ambivalent
middle
and
an
immigration
policy
that
is
not
well
understood
the
1986
reform
outlawed
the
hiring
of
illegal
immigrants
and
required
employers
to
check
job
applicants
for
proof
of
legal
status
but
fake
identification
was
easy
to
obtain
and
the
hiring
of
illegal
immigrants
continued
apace
poorly
guarded
borders
and
lax
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
have
made
it
easy
for
illegal
immigrants
many
of
whom
arrive
with
visas
which
they
then
overstay
to
work
their
way
into
american
life
with
impunity
the
1986
amnesty
for
some
has
only
encouraged
more
to
come
and
the
system
for
legal
immigration
was
not
reformed
complicating
matters
for
advocates
of
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
is
the
opposition
they
face
from
powerful
interests
like
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
and
labor
unions
which
believe
immigration
reform
will
make
for
a
more
orderly
employment
system
and
thus
be
a
boon
to
the
us
economy
opponents
of
comprehensive
reform
particularly
the
path
to
citizenship
see
other
motivations
at
work
this
is
an
issue
with
strange
dynamics
says
dan
stein
president
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
you
have
wellmoneyed
special
interests
either
on
the
side
of
the
status
quo
or
largescale
immigration
some
business
groups
like
hiring
illegal
labor
because
its
docile
and
exploitable
more
recently
mr
stein
adds
the
democratic
party
has
become
more
enchanted
with
immigrations
potential
to
build
an
electoral
base
the
institutional
interests
of
the
two
parties
have
hardened
in
a
way
that
neutralizes
positive
public
discourse
in
the
runup
to
the
2010
midterms
the
importance
of
the
latino
vote
is
evident
in
a
february
report
americas
voice
identifies
40
battleground
house
and
senate
races
where
latino
voters
will
be
key
although
immigration
is
not
the
no
1
issue
for
most
latinos
it
is
clearly
a
defining
issue
the
report
says
like
all
americans
the
economic
crisis
continues
to
be
the
biggest
concern
for
latino
voters
the
report
continues
however
their
closeness
to
the
immigrant
experience
makes
immigration
reform
a
threshold
issue
for
many
so
its
not
just
reid
who
is
looking
to
his
latino
constituents
to
save
his
seat
but
on
the
flip
side
there
are
members
for
whom
the
immigration
issue
could
be
toxic
particularly
so
for
conservative
democrats
in
districts
without
large
immigrant
populations
they
want
nothing
to
do
with
immigration
reform
this
year
and
not
all
republicans
are
enamored
of
the
new
arizona
law
former
florida
gov
jeb
bush
has
raised
objections
as
has
the
states
republican
candidate
for
the
senate
marco
rubio
the
son
of
cuban
immigrants
the
arizona
law
goes
into
effect
90
days
from
its
april
23
signing
unless
a
court
challenge
succeeds
in
blocking
implementation
the
most
likely
outcome
for
immigration
reform
is
that
the
senate
holds
off
at
least
until
next
year
allowing
the
electoral
considerations
to
recede
in
prominence
but
one
need
look
no
further
than
the
major
push
for
immigration
reform
in
2007
to
wonder
if
an
overhaul
will
ever
be
doable
then
a
republican
president
george
w
bush
led
the
charge
and
got
12
republican
senators
to
join
him
but
the
measure
still
failed
to
reach
the
floor
for
a
vote
in
this
latest
effort
at
reform
the
only
republican
willing
to
work
with
the
democrats
was
sen
lindsey
graham
r
of
south
carolina
now
hes
off
that
track
incensed
that
reid
had
pushed
to
move
immigration
reform
before
energy
legislation
and
some
analysts
say
to
protect
his
friend
john
mccain
the
arizona
senator
who
at
one
time
was
a
major
proponent
of
comprehensive
reform
but
has
backed
away
given
his
primary
challenge
from
the
right
what
you
have
is
great
disappointment
that
immigration
didnt
move
in
2007
despite
bipartisan
support
a
republican
president
pushing
it
and
things
getting
a
lot
worse
out
there
with
laws
like
in
arizona
says
democratic
communications
strategist
peter
fenn
there
is
impetus
to
move
solid
good
federal
legislation
especially
when
states
are
going
to
blame
the
federal
government
for
not
acting
but
the
key
is
to
craft
a
bill
that
can
actually
pass
