beset
by
mission

a
bipartisan
commission
plans
to
recommend
that
congress
abolish
the
156yearold
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
disperse
its
functions
across
other
government
agencies
in
a
report
to
be
published
next
month
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
will
advise
breaking
up
the
management
of
an
immigration
system
that
it
views
as
illdesigned
to
handle
a
huge
influx
of
immigration
in
recent
years
and
an
increasingly
complex
mission
the
recommendations
are
motivated
by
longstanding
structural
problems
within
the
ins
and
not
by
a
spate
of
failings
and
scandals
that
have
plagued
the
agency
lately
said
lawrence
h
fuchs
one
of
the
commissions
nine
members
although
the
agencys
budget
has
grown
more
than
fivefold
and
its
staff
has
doubled
over
the
last
decade
a
number
of
problems
persist
and
there
are
some
fundamental
structural
impediments
to
doing
the
job
right
said
bruce
a
morrison
another
commissioner
and
a
former
democratic
congressman
from
connecticut
the
panel
appointed
by
congress
and
the
president
in
1990
to
advise
legislators
on
immigration
issues
is
scheduled
to
publish
its
fourth
and
final
major
report
before
disbanding
at
the
end
of
september
the
ins
yesterday
argued
strongly
against
the
recommendations
which
were
reported
yesterday
in
the
new
york
times
in
a
statement
the
agency
said
its
basic
functions
of
enforcing
us
immigration
laws
and
providing
services
to
applicants
for
immigration
benefits
are
complementary
not
competitive
and
that
the
ins
only
in
the
last
few
years
has
begun
to
receive
the
resources
it
needs
to
overcome
a
history
of
neglect
this
recent
investment
by
the
american
people
is
now
beginning
to
pay
off
the
statement
said
breaking
up
the
agency
which
has
been
proposed
frequently
over
the
years
would
be
needlessly
expensive
and
duplicative
requiring
other
federal
agencies
to
build
separate
new
capacities
while
proposals
to
reorganize
management
of
the
us
immigration
system
have
surfaced
periodically
at
least
since
the
truman
administration
the
increasing
complexity
of
that
system
and
the
immigration
agencys
troubles
have
combined
to
raise
the
prospects
for
some
kind
of
congressional
action
on
the
latest
recommendations
analysts
said
sen
spencer
abraham
rmich
who
called
for
ins
reforms
in
his
first
speech
as
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
said
yesterday
we
should
consider
splitting
the
ins
up
into
one
enforcement
agency
and
one
legal
immigration
agency
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
both
according
to
a
20page
briefing
paper
that
the
commission
has
circulated
in
congress
some
of
the
multiple
government
agencies
that
implement
various
aspects
of
immigration
laws
particularly
the
ins
have
so
many
priorities
that
they
have
proved
unable
to
manage
all
of
them
effectively
it
added
such
a
system
is
set
up
for
failure
and
with
it
further
loss
of
public
confidence
in
the
us
immigration
system
it
really
is
mission
overload
fuchs
said
of
the
immigration
services
increased
responsibilities
in
recent
years
in
addition
to
tightening
border
control
against
illegal
immigration
cracking
down
on
alien
smuggling
increasing
deportations
and
reducing
unauthorized
employment
the
service
has
been
called
upon
to
speed
up
naturalizations
to
cope
with
record
numbers
of
citizenship
applicants
and
process
historically
high
levels
of
immigrants
the
briefing
paper
said
the
commission
would
recommend
consolidating
within
the
state
justice
and
labor
departments
the
immigration
systems
four
main
operations
border
and
interior
enforcement
adjudication
of
visas
and
immigration
benefits
enforcement
of
immigrationrelated
labor
standards
and
appeals
of
administrative
decisions
this
approach
calls
for
establishment
of
a
bureau
of
immigration
enforcement
within
the
justice
department
to
bring
together
in
one
agency
the
border
patrol
inspections
of
people
arriving
at
ports
of
entry
investigations
of
immigration
related
crime
detention
of
illegal
aliens
and
deportations
at
present
the
border
patrol
functions
as
a
branch
of
the
ins
which
is
part
of
the
justice
department
in
the
state
department
an
undersecretariat
for
citizenship
immigration
and
refugee
admissions
would
be
created
to
handle
processing
of
all
types
of
visas
and
other
services
including
naturalization
and
passport
issuance
the
labor
department
would
take
over
responsibility
for
enforcing
sanctions
against
employers
who
hire
illegal
workers
or
fail
to
comply
with
other
immigration
related
requirements
the
commission
has
made
no
estimate
of
how
much
the
reorganization
would
cost
officials
said
this
is
a
policy
and
management
thing
rather
than
a
budget
thing
