hundreds
of
illegal
immigrants
stayed
in
the
oklahoma
county
jail
nearly
twice
as
long
as
the
national
average
before
being
removed
in
2008
because
of
problems
this
is
according
to
a
recent
report
released
by
the
syracuse
university
project
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
its
a
pretty
good
revenue
enhancer
if
there
are
extra
cells
said
stan
inman
former
district
3
county
commissioner
the
federal
government
pays
more
to
the
jail
than
the
state
or
city
to
house
its
prisoners
mark
myers
spokesman
for
oklahoma
county
sheriff
john
whetsel
said
money
had
nothing
to
do
with
why
they
were
there
so
long
when
someone
commits
a
crime
the
system
is
in
place
for
them
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
courts
then
the
federal
government
determines
what
happens
he
said
but
whetsel
implemented
a
hiring
freeze
shortly
after
the
removal
of
the
prisoners
citing
a
potential
loss
of
as
much
as
32
million
a
year
in
lost
revenue
at
the
time
the
county
was
being
reimbursed
4233
per
day
by
the
federal
government
for
each
federal
prisoner
this
compares
to
about
30
per
inmate
held
for
the
oklahoma
corrections
department
and
4066
for
those
held
for
oklahoma
city
inman
said
the
federal
immigration
system
is
rife
with
problems
and
is
notoriously
slow
in
how
it
deals
with
jails
but
reimbursement
money
received
from
the
federal
government
went
into
the
sheriffs
special
revenuecash
funds
while
the
county
paid
for
daily
expenses
im
not
saying
he
profited
by
it
but
it
could
give
him
surplus
revenue
inman
said
its
alarming
that
the
length
of
detention
is
significantly
higher
said
t
douglas
stump
an
immigration
attorney
with
more
than
25
years
of
experience
working
in
immigration
law
stump
said
he
frequently
encounters
detained
immigrants
who
have
been
misled
about
where
they
are
in
the
process
of
dealing
with
immigration
officials
he
said
this
can
affect
the
persons
length
of
stay
in
the
jail
stump
wouldnt
speculate
on
blame
for
the
longer
detentions
at
the
county
jail
in
the
12
months
leading
up
to
the
august
2008
removal
of
160
federal
inmates
from
the
oklahoma
county
jail
about
2000
immigration
detainees
went
through
the
jail
oklahoma
county
lost
its
status
with
immigration
officials
due
to
civil
rights
abuses
and
deplorable
conditions
there
according
to
a
federal
justice
department
report
myers
said
jail
officials
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
detention
length
cited
in
the
report
he
said
the
jail
has
been
operating
without
federal
inmates
and
has
made
do
without
those
reimbursements
but
were
at
a
point
now
that
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
do
is
come
up
with
more
funding
to
run
the
jail
he
said
carl
rusnok
spokesman
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
said
there
are
many
factors
that
determine
a
detainees
length
of
stay
including
immigration
court
backlogs
communication
between
jail
and
immigration
officials
and
drawn
out
legal
matters
its
not
all
dependent
on
what
happens
at

rusnok
said
tulsa
has
federal
deal
the
tulsa
county
sheriffs
department
began
contracting
with
the
federal
government
to
house
immigration
detainees
in
2007
the
department
is
one
of
63
jails
in
the
country
and
the
only
one
in
oklahoma
that
has
an
agreement
with

officials
sgt

public
information
officer
for
the

also
supervises
the
immigration
enforcement
program
there
he
said
nearly
3800
detainees
were
processed
in
2009
under
the
jails
agreement
with
immigration
officials
they
are
reimbursed
5413
per

held
there
each

data
contained
in

for

clark
said
noncriminal
offenders
leave
the
jail
in
a
few
days
and
some
complicated
immigration
cases
can
go
on
for
years
the
transactional

access
clearinghouse
group
studied
millions
of
federal
immigration
records
tracking
immigration
detainees
dating
back
from
1998
through
2009
at
a
glance
detention
process
in
immigration
when
an
illegal
immigrant
is
taken
into
custody
there
are
several
ways
to
proceed
if
a
person
from
mexico
or
canada
is
detained
for
their
immigration
status
and
has
no
criminal
background
they
can
voluntarily
return
to
their
home
country
at
the
expense
of
the
federal
government
this
typically
happens
within
a
matter
of
days
when
a
detainee
has
a
criminal
background
and
the
federal
government
determines
it
is
going
to
remove
the
detainee
the
government
begins
paperwork
for
deportation
the
official
removal
of
someone
from
the
country
for
either
criminal
or
immigration
reasons
detained
people
from
nonneighboring
countries
must
apply
for
travel
documents
through
that
countrys
government
every
country
is
different
on
response
times
other
situations
can
occur
where
federal
government
officials
allow
detainees
to
leave
on
their
own
recognizance
the
length
of
time
people
are
detained
for
immigration
status
often
comes
down
to
whether
the
detainees
choose
to
voluntarily
return
to
their
country
or
contest
their
immigration
status
complicated
immigration
court
cases
can
take
as
long
as
three
years
those
determined
by
immigration
officials
not
to
be
a
flight
risk
can
be
allowed
to
post
bail
immigration
officials
in
the
state
can
make
this
decision
few
people
use
this
avenue
primarily
because
of
a
lack
of
financial
resources
