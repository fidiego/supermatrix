the
obama
administration
has
failed
in
its
efforts
to
secure
the
border
and
enforce
immigration
laws
an
antiillegal
immigration
group
said
in
a
report
released
wednesday
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
washington
dcbased
group
says
the
administration
has
systemically
dismantled
immigration
enforcement
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
obama
has
delayed
on
three
occasions
a
requirement
that
federal
contractors
use
the
everify
employment
verification
system
according
to
the
report
the
group
says
the
administration
has
gutted
worksite
enforcement
operations
by
allowing
illegal
immigrants
to
stay
in
the
country
and
compete
with
american
citizens
and
legal
immigrants
for
jobs
the
administration
has
undermined
the
287g
program
that
allows
federal
officials
to
train
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
report
says
dan

the
groups
president
said
obama
and
members
of
his
administration
have
repeatedly
expressed
their
desire
to
push
amnesty
legislation
through
congress
the
administration
is
making
empty
promises
of
immigration
enforcement
to
make
amnesty
more
palatable
to
the
american
people
stein
said
in
a
speech
last
month

is
fully
committed
to
reforming
immigration
laws
at
a
hearing
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
on
wednesday
she
renewed
her
call
for
congress
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
everybody
recognizes
that
our
current
system
isnt
working
and
that
our
immigration
laws
need
to
change
napolitano
said
in
remarks
to
the
center
for
american
progress
in
november
she
said
the
government
is
serious
about
immigration
enforcement
the
flow
of
illegal
immigrants
into
the
united
states
has
declined
sharply
since
2007
when
immigration
reform
legislation
last
failed
in
congress
the
border
patrol
has
more
than
20000
officers
and
there
are
more
than
600
miles
of
border
fencing
she
said
the
government
also
has
expanded
a
program
that
identifies
and
removes
the
most
dangerous
illegal
immigrant
criminals
from
the
country
she
said
she
said
the
administration
has
expanded
and
improved
the
use
of
the
everify
system
which
allows
employers
to
electronically
prove
that
they
arent
hiring
illegal
immigrants
the
administration
has
also
ended
a
yearlong
backlog
for
background
checks
on
applicants
for
green
cards
and
naturalization
the
government
has
improved
technology
to
prevent
people
from
using
forged
documents
to
enter
the
country
she
said
at
the
border
in
the
interior
of
the
country
and
when
it
comes
to
legal
immigration
the
government
has
made
significant
strides
to
improve
enforcement
napolitano
said
some
local
immigrant
advocacy
groups
arent
happy
with
obamas
performance
on
immigration
issues
we
have
noticed
an
increase
in
detentions
and
arrests
of
people
who
already
had
outstanding
deportation
orders
said
emilio
amaya
director
of
the
san
bernardino
community
service
center
a
nonprofit
immigrant
assistance
organization
as
they
try
to
please
some
of
the
antiimmigrant
groups
in
the
country
our
community
is
paying
the
consequences
adrian
pantoja
associate
professor
of
political
studies
at
pitzer
college
in
claremont
said
he
would
advise
obama
to
avoid
immigration
reform
in
his
first
term
its
impossible
to
satisfy
everyone
when
positions
are
so
polarized
he
said
its
a
political
hot
potato
pantoja

as
