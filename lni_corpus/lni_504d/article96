monday
arizona
did
supreme
court
take
the
steam
out
of
states
immigration
activism
a
majority
of
americans
want
to
see
their
states
adopt
immigration
laws
similar
to
arizonas
but
the
supreme
courts
decision
monday
may
give
state
legislators
more
wiggle
room

avoid

while
the
us
supreme
court
on
monday
struck
down
major
pieces
of
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
as
state
overreach
its
far
from
clear
whether
the
ruling
will
quash
legislative
efforts
in
other
states
to
ferret
out
illegal
immigrants
in
their
populations
the
political
backlash
over
state
immigration
laws
and
the
natural
ebbing
of
illegal
migration
resulting
from
the
poor
economy
were
two
reasons
the
number
of
immigrationrelated
bills
at
the
state
level
declined
by
44
percent
between
2011
and
2012
but
a
big
part
of
that
equation
was
also
the
supreme
courts
pondering
of
arizonas
sb
1070
as
states
awaited
an
inkling
of
where
the
nations
top
judges
stood
on
the
topic
the
decision
on
monday
was
in
parts
decisive
chiding
arizona
at
one
point
for
introducing
intrusions
on
the
federal
scheme
but
it
left
intact
the
arizona
laws
papers
please
provision
that
allows
police
officers
to
ask
for
identification
from
people
they
suspect
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
that
caveat
leaves
enough
of
an
opening
for
state
legislators
to
keep
weighing
the
majority
support
among
americans
for
tough
immigrationrelated
laws
against
such
laws
political
and
economic
risks
short
term
this
decision
keeps
immigration
as
a
frontandcenter
issue
in
the
2012
election
because
it
didnt
provide
closure
and
essentially
told
both
sides
to
go
at
it
says
peter
brown
assistant
director
of
the
quinnipiac
university
polling
institute
in
the
long
term
what
it
means
is
that
state
legislatures
at
least
in
some
states
will
likely
have
to
deal
with
this
in
terms
of
whether
they
get
an
arizonastyle
law
that
includes
the
parts
that
got
the
seal
of
approval
the
supreme
court
did
draw
some
definitive
lines
for
states
pondering
arizonastyle
laws
making
it
a
state
crime
for
an
illegal
immigrant
to
seek
work
and
walk
around
without
immigration
papers
for
example
is
not
allowed
also
not
allowed
is
giving
police
authority
to
arrest
people
for
immigration
related
crimes
federal
law
makes
a
single
sovereign
responsible
for
maintaining
a
comprehensive
and
unified
system
to
keep
track
of
aliens
within
the
nations
borders
justice
anthony
kennedy
wrote
in
the
5to3
majority
opinion
justice
kennedy
noted
specifically
that
if
the
court
allowed
arizona
to
arrest
people
for
not
carrying
papers
attesting
to
their
legal
residency
status
every
state
could
give
itself
independent
authority
to
prosecute
federal
registration
violations
on
the
papers
please
aspect
the
court
in
effect
said
it
needs
to
be
tested
after
implementation
since
the
justices
could
not
gauge
its
legal
implications
without
seeing
it
at
play
the
arizona
law
allows
police
officers
in
the
process
of
enforcing
other
laws
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
reasonably
believe
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
a
key
part
of
the
broader
symbolism
of
state
immigration
laws
intended
to
push
illegal
immigrants
to
move
elsewhere
that
spectre
of
racial
profiling
is
a
critical
one
as
attitudes
around
immigration
are
looming
larger
in
the
presidential
election
across
the
us
about
56
percent
of
americans
want
to
see
their
states
adopt
an
arizonastyle
law
according
to
quinnipiac
but
among
hispanics
in
battleground
states
the
spectre
of
the
supreme
court
upholding
the
papers
please
provision
showed
that
60
percent
of
latino
voters
thought
it
would
create
an
antiimmigrant
and
antihispanic
environment
with
28
percent
of
latinos
saying
the
law
would
have
no
effect
on
attitudes
according
to
a
recent
latino
decisions
poll
in
tennessee
polls
regularly
show
at
least
70
percent
of
voters
backing
tougher
immigration
laws
and
joe
carr
a
republican
lawmaker
from
murfreesboro
has
acquiesced
sponsoring
several
key
antiillegal
immigrant
bills
that
have
passed
the
tennessee
legislature
with
bipartisan
majorities
dissatisfaction
with
washingtons
ability
to
control
immigration
remains
a
driving
force
in
the
states
politics
he
says
although
he
concedes
lawmakers
dont
have
much
more
work
to
do
on
the
immigration
front
now
that
the
supreme
court
decision
has
come
down
we
will
be
taking
a
hard
look
at
what
other
additional
measures
we
can
take
that
the
court
has
allowed
to
move
forward
mr
carr
says
some
immigration
experts
say
its
likely
that
the
steady
growth
in
immigration
related
state
bills
since
2005
is
over
punctuated
by
mondays
supreme
court
decision
in
the
first
quarter
of
2012
legislators
introduced
865
immigrationrelated
bills
and
resolutions
compared
with
1538
in
the
same
period
in
2011
according
to
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
arizona
lawmakers
introduced
33
immigrationrelated
bills
this
year
compared
with
57
last
year
i
think
at
this
point
weve
literally
exhausted
every
state
or
municipality
willing
to
pass
these
kinds
of
laws
says
jamie
longazel
a
sociologist
who
studies
immigrationrelated
issues
at
the
university
of
dayton
one
telling
fact
the
supreme
court
in
a
case
out
of
arizona
last
year
confirmed
the
ability
of
states
to
demand
that
employers
use
the
federal
everify
immigration
database
to
check
the
status
of
new
employees
in
the
year
since
no
states
even
states
like
alabama
and
georgia
which
passed
sb
1070style
laws
in
the
interim
have
actually
walked
through
the
door
the
supreme
court
opened
to
mandate
such
checks
meanwhile
backlash
from
not
just
hispanic
activists
but
also
from
teachers
religious
leaders
business
people
and
farmers
have
made
immigrationrelated
legislation
more
difficult
and
politically
risky
to
pass
policy
experts
say
its
really
possible
that
were
seeing
an
important
turning
point
says
tamara
jacoby
president
of
immigrationworks
usa
which
advocates
immigration
reform
on
behalf
of
small
businesses
i
think
a
lot
of
people
in
the
states
have
been
waiting
for
a
way
to
save
them
from
having
to
pass
tougher
immigration
laws
and
i
think
the
supreme
court
decision
helps
them
