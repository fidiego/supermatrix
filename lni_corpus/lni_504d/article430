canadian
immigration
officers
at
us
border
crossings
have
been
ignoring
an
immigration
department
directive
to
check
with
us
immigration
officials
before
turning
back
refugee
claimants
on
tuesday
morning
at
fort
erie
ont
an
iranian
man
tried
to
cross
into
canada
to
claim
refugee
status
under
a
canadian
government
policy
implemented
on
feb
20
he
was
turned
back
after
being
given
a
may
28
date
for
an
immigration
inquiry
before
the
man
was
to
be
sent
back
to
the
us
side
of
the
border
his
toronto
lawyer
lorne
waldman
asked
immigration
officers
if
they
were
going
to
check
with
their
us
counterparts
for
an
outstanding
warrant
or
possible
deportation
order
on
the
iranian
an
immigration
officer
replied
that
the
routine
was
to
return
a
refugee
claimant
without
a
check
if
there
is
a
problem
the
us
guys
will
call
us
and
the
individual
will
be
sent
back
to
us
and
well
admit
him
james
campbell
director
of
enforcement
and
control
for
the
canadian
immigration
department
s
ontario
region
said
all
immigration
officers
at
border
crossings
have
been
told
that
every
individual
returned
to
the
united
states
must
first
be
checked
with
us
immigration
officials
to
determine
if
they
will
guarantee
that
the
applicant
will
be
allowed
to
return
to
canada
for
the
inquiry
on
the
scheduled
date
if
there
is
any
doubt
we
are
not
to
return
them
a
directive
from
the
immigration
department
states
while
determination
of
the
degree
of
risk
or
of
removal
from
the
united
states
is
most
critical
in
the
cases
of
the
citizens
of
guatemala
and
el
salvador
officers
must
be
satisfied
on
the
basis
of
consultation
with
their
us
ins
immigration
and
naturalization
service
counterparts
prior
to
directing
back
that
any
person
directed
back
to
the
usa
under
these
instructions
is
not
subject
to
imminent
removal
from
that
country
however
after
checking
with
immigration
officers
at
the
fort
erie
and
niagara
falls
border
crossings
mr
campbell
confirmed
that
local
arrangements
rather
than
the
directive
were
being
followed
mr
campbell
said
a
local
arrangement
was
instituted
because
of
the
large
numbers
that
were
crossing
particularly
at
fort
erie
and
because
us
immigration
officials
in
buffalo
would
not
give
any
guarantees
over
the
phone
until
they
had
actually
spoken
to
the
individuals
they
agreed
that
we
would
simply
send
the
people
back
to
us
ins
and
if
there
was
any
problem
whatsoever
us
ins
would
call
us
right
away
and
we
would
take
the
people
back
into
canada
he
said
this
has
been
going
on
for
some
time
and
appears
to
working
well
they
tell
me
mr
campbell
added
that
the
same
procedure
was
instituted
at
niagara
falls
about
two
weeks
ago
he
agreed
that
the
exact
letter
of
the
directive
from
ottawa
was
not
being
followed
but
i
think
you
can
say
were
trying
to
follow
the
intent
of
the
directive
and
that
is
to
make
sure
that
no
one
is
in
jeopardy
of
being
deported
by
the
americans
i
think
that
we
are
achieving
that
by
this
process
a
major
concern
voiced
by
refugeeaid
groups
when
the
policy
was
announced
in
february
was
that
if
any
refugee
claimant
is
returned
to
the
united
states
from
canada
he
or
she
could
be
arrested
and
deported
immediately
if
there
was
an
outstanding
deportation
order
recent
immigration
figures
indicate
that
scores
of
guatemalans
and
salvadoreans
who
had
crossed
and
were
returned
to
the
united
states
to
await
their
inquiry
date
did
not
show
up
for
their
hearing
we
dont
know
what
happened
to
them
mr
campbell
said
maybe
they
got
fed
up
of
waiting
around
and
left
however
some
refugeeaid
groups
fear
that
us
immigration
officials
executed
outstanding
deportation
orders
on
many
of
them
mr
waldman
said
he
is
flabbergasted
and
shocked
that
the
directive
is
not
being
followed
im
sure
refugees
who
are
being
returned
to
the
us
are
being
put
in
jeopardy
as
a
result
of
this
practice
and
i
have
grave
concerns
about
what
happened
to
many
of
those
people
who
havent
shown
up
for
their
inquiry
mr
waldman
said
immigration
officers
should
comply
fully
with
the
letter
of
the
directive
and
if
they
feel
they
cannot
get
the
cooperation
from
their
us
counterparts
then
they
should
not
return
any
refugee
claimants
anything
less
would
put
refugees
at
risk
