in
an
effort
to
improve
the
nations
immigration
system
a
federal
advisory
panel
has
decided
to
recommend
abolishing
the
troubled
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
assigning
its
duties
to
other
government
agencies
declaring
that
the
immigration
service
suffers
from
mission
overload
the
panel
the
united
states
commission
on
immigration
reform
is
proposing
that
the
justice
department
the
immigration
services
parent
agency
retain
responsibility
for
controlling
the
border
and
removing
illegal
immigrants
the
state
department
which
now
deals
with
visas
at
american
embassies
overseas
would
handle
immigration
services
and
benefits
like
citizenship
requests
the
labor
department
which
now
monitors
wage
and
hour
laws
would
also
enforce
rules
covering
the
hiring
of
foreign
workers
according
to
a
draft
copy
of
the
report
structuring
organizing
and
managing
an
effective
immigration
system
obtained
by
the
new
york
times
its
very
hard
for
one
agency
with
so
many
conflicting
missions
and
so
much
fragmentation
to
have
priorities
set
and
missions
realized
said
bruce
a
morrison
a
commission
member
and
a
former
democratic
congressman
from
connecticut
explaining
the
panels
reasoning
for
dismantling
the
immigration
service
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
who
have
been
briefed
by
the
commission
in
the
last
few
weeks
generally
embrace
the
proposal
to
separate
along
functional
lines
the
disparate
immigration
duties
but
the
immigration
service
and
the
justice
department
are
gearing
up
to
fight
the
proposal
were
against
splitting
up
ins
said
carole
florman
a
justice
department
spokeswoman
we
believe
the
enforcement
functions
and
benefits
functions
really
do
work
hand
in
hand
the
proposal
comes
at
a
time
when
congress
and
many
of
the
nations
governors
are
growing
increasingly
exasperated
with
the
immigration
services
inability
to
cope
with
soaring
requests
for
citizenship
weed
out
criminal
aliens
living
in
the
united
states
and
crack
down
on
the
steady
stream
of
illegal
immigrants
entering
the
country
the
message
to
the
administration
is
that
this
is
not
about
rearranging
deck
chairs
on
a
sinking
ship
its
about
getting
results
said
allen
kay
a
spokesman
for
representative
lamar
smith
the
texas
republican
who
heads
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
and
has
been
briefed
on
the
proposal
the
house
appropriations
committee
last
month
directed
attorney
general
janet
reno
to
review
the
commissions
report
and
along
with
other
federal
agencies
develop
a
restructuring
plan
to
perform
the
nations
immigration
duties
more
efficiently
house
members
led
by
representative
harold
rogers
the
kentucky
republican
who
heads
the
appropriations
subcommittee
that
oversees
the
justice
department
are
urging
the
administration
to
act
on
the
proposal
by
october
1998
the
commissions
report
is
to
be
released
by
late
september
the
scope
of
the
panels
recommendations
has
surprised
many
senior
administration
officials
policymakers
who
have
been
briefed
on
the
commissions
findings
including
patrick
f
kennedy
the
acting
under
secretary
of
state
for
management
declined
today
to
comment
on
the
conclusions
privately
though
administration
officials
said
the
report
would
be
a
starting
point
for
a
spirited
debate
on
how
to
manage
the
countrys
burgeoning
immigration
system
many
of
the
nations
governors
also
find
the
commissions
proposals
intriguing
the
ins
has
done
an
abominable
job
in
so
many
areas
including
patrolling
the
border
that
we
are
certainly
open
to
looking
at
other
options
said
sean
walsh
deputy
chief
of
staff
to
gov
pete
wilson
of
california
a
republican
officials
at
the
immigration
service
one
of
the
fastestgrowing
agencies
in
the
government
whose
budget
has
doubled
to
31
billion
this
fiscal
year
from
four
years
ago
said
the
commissions
proposal
would
reverse
this
financial
investment
and
ignore
improvements
the
agency
had
made
in
recent
years
in
response
to
congressional
criticism
wed
be
redoing
all
the
work
weve
done
in
the
past
said
chris
sale
the
immigration
services
deputy
commissioner
independent
immigration
experts
who
criticize
the
immigrations
dual
role
as
border
cop
and
benefit
provider
today
gave
mixed
reviews
to
the
commissions
proposals
many
said
they
needed
to
see
more
details
theres
ample
reason
to
doubt
that
the
ins
can
be
a
service
provider
and
an
enforcer
for
the
same
group
of
people
cecilia
munoz
deputy
vice
president
of
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
civil
rights
group
in
washington
however
its
not
clear
that
separating
the
functions
is
going
to
fix
the
fact
that
the
service
side
of
the
ins
has
traditionally
gotten
short
shrift
demetrios
g
papademetriou
a
senior
associate
at
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
was
more
critical
the
commissions
intent
is
to
generate
a
conversation
rather
than
to
actually
put
out
a
blueprint
this
proposal
would
send
an
orphan
agency
from
one
department
to
another
in
washington
terms
this
should
be
dead
on
arrival
mr
papademetriou
said
he
favored
combining
all
the
nations
immigration
duties
into
one
new
agency
similar
to
how
the
government
consolidated
the
tasks
of
11
agencies
to
form
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
1970
that
would
give
an
agency
the
authority
to
be
held
directly
accountable
and
to
have
the
opportunity
to
propose
and
fight
for
its
own
proposals
mr
papademetriou
the
commission
considered
creating
an
independent
immigration
agency
mr
morrison
said
but
ultimately
rejected
that
idea
as
less
effective
than
assigning
inss
duties
to
other
agencies
congress
created
the
bipartisan
commission
in
1990
to
help
advise
lawmakers
on
immigration
issues
eight
commissioners
evenly
divided
among
republicans
and
democrats
are
appointed
by
congress
and
the
president
appoints
the
chairman
the
panel
had
its
greatest
influence
when
the
late
barbara
jordan
the
former
congresswoman
from
texas
was
the
chairwoman
during
her
tenure
the
panel
issued
reports
on
legal
and
illegal
immigration
earlier
this
year
after
her
death
the
panel
released
a
third
report
which
criticized
provisions
of
an
immigration
law
passed
last
year
that
authorizes
the
immediate
expulsion
of
some
wouldbe
refugees
who
arrive
in
the
united
states
but
the
commissions
fourth
and
final
report
is
likely
to
be
its
most
politically
explosive
after
interviewing
current
and
former
immigration
officials
from
several
government
agencies
the
panel
concluded
some
of
the
agencies
that
implement
the
immigration
laws
the
ins
in
particular
have
so
many
priorities
that
they
have
proved
unable
to
manage
all
of
them
effectively
the
report
continues
such
a
system
is
set
up
for
failure
and
with
such
failure
further
loss
of
public
confidence
in
the
immigration
system
to
solve
this
problem
the
panel
recommended
thinking
of
the
immigration
system
as
having
four
main
components
border
and
interior
enforcement
benefits
and
visas
workplace
labor
standards
and
an
appeals
process
for
enforcement
actions
the
enforcement
functions
including
removing
illegal
immigrations
and
breaking
up
smuggling
rings
would
be
handled
by
a
new
division
or
bureau
in
the
justice
department
these
functions
already
receive
priority
at
ins
but
identifying
them
as
the
sole
mission
of
a
single
agency
would
avoid
some
of
the
conflicting
priorities
the
draft
report
said
the
state
department
would
assume
all
responsibilities
for
immigrants
benefits
if
all
the
responsibilities
were
consolidated
the
draft
report
said
there
would
be
a
seamless
process
beginning
with
nonimmigrant
and
immigrant
processing
through
naturalization
to
passport
issuance
and
overseas
citizenship
services
the
labor
department
would
have
new
duties
for
enforcing
sanctions
against
employers
who
fail
to
verify
workauthorization
requirements
the
draft
report
said
the
head
of
the
panel
is
shirley
m
hufstedler
in
addition
to
mr
morrison
the
