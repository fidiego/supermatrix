state
representative
proposed
legislation
tuesday
backed
by
several
local
lawmakers
that
was
inspired
by
a
controversial
law
passed
last
week
in
arizona
to
combat
illegal
immigration
if
passed
the
bill
by
rep
daryl
metcalfe
rbutler
would
charge
local
law
enforcement
with
checking
immigration
status
investigating
businesses
suspected
of
knowingly
employing
illegal
immigrants
and
requiring
businesses
to
verify
a
potential
employees
legal
status
the
proposal
came
a
day
after
state
sen
daylin
leach
dmontgomery
introduced
a
bill
in
direct
opposition
to
arizonas
law
rep
scott
perry
rcarroll
township
supports
metcalfes
effort
and
said
he
will
likely
join
as
bill
cosponsor
the
federal
government
has
failed
to
enforce
the
nations
immigration
laws
perry
said
which
is
now
forcing
states
to
act
because
illegal
immigration
fosters
crime
lowers
wages
and
puts
an
added
burden
on
taxpayers
what
do
we
gain
having
cheaper
tomatoes
in
the
short
term
to
sell
out
our
security
and
sovereignty
in
the
long
term
perry
said
both
perry
and
metcalfe
said
the
proposal
doesnt
target
any
one
ethnic
or
immigrant
group
jose
colon
president
of
the
board
for
the
centro
hispano
jose
hernandez
said
much
of
yorks
hispanic
community
agrees
too
many
illegal
immigrants
abuse
the
system
he
said
he
supports
people
stopped
for
violating
the
law
having
to
prove
who
they
are
saying
it
only
makes
sense
in
an
age
of
terror
but
colon
said
the
necessary
immigration
laws
already
exist
and
the
federal
government
needs
to
better
enforce
them
the
federal
government
is
more
equipped
to
properly
deal
with
the
issue
than
states
or
municipalities
he
said
colon
was
also
bothered
by
the
rhetoric
metcalfe
used
introducing
his
proposal
when
he
spoke
of
murders
and
rapists
the
vast
majority
of
people
here
illegally
came
to
work
colon
said
and
it
makes
it
harder
to
have
the
serious
necessary
discussion
of
the
issue
with
such
inflamed
rhetoric
and
he
added
such
talk
could
create
friction
between
the
hispanic
community
and
others
craig
trebilcock
a
local
immigration
attorney
said
the
federal
government
has
failed
to
create
a
working
immigration
policy
but
metcalfes
policy
is
still
ridiculous
trebilcock
said
the
people
pressing
these
laws
dont
understand
how
complex
it
is
to
determine
the
immigration
status
of
someone
there
are
42
types
of
visas
trebilcock
said
and
thats
before
counting
those
granted
asylum
and
others
local
law
enforcement
no
matter
how
well
meaning
are
not
trained
or
equipped
to
become
primary
immigration
enforcement
officers
trebilcock
said
youll
end
up
with
a
bunch
of
lawsuits
trebilcock
said
a
bunch
of
municipalities
getting
sued
because
of
the
thousands
of
people
getting
stopped
theres
going
to
be
a
couple
problems
instead
he
said
the
law
will
discourage
legal
immigrants
doctors
scientists
laborers
students
that
the
country
needs

every
coming
here
about
the
bill
if
passed
house
bill
2479
would
require
an
employer
to
verify
a
prospective
employees
immigration
status
lying
about
immigration
status
would
be
a
seconddegree
misdemeanor
require
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
verify
a
persons
immigration
status
if
the
officer
reasonably
suspects
that
a
person
legally
stopped
detained
or
arrested
is
in
the
country
illegally
an
officer
could
not
inquire
about
peoples
immigration
status
if
they
were
not
first
stopped
for
another
offense
require
county
district
attorneys
to
investigate
companies
suspected
of
employing
illegal
immigrants
companies
caught
knowingly
doing
so
could
lose
access
to
state
grants
and
their
licenses
to
operate
create
a
thirddegree
felony
for
intentionally
smuggling
illegal
aliens
into
pennsylvania

in

state
reps
daryl
metcalfe
and
scott
perry
were
part
of
a
group
that
introduced
a
series
of
bills
that
would
have
changed
some
of
pennsylvanias
immigration
laws
those
never
made
it
out
of
committee
metcalfe
said
tuesday
his
proposal
has
bipartisan
support
but
is
not
likely
to
receive
much
support
from
house
democratic
leadership
or
gov
ed
rendell
however
he
said
with
a
budget
fight
looming
and
representatives
up
for
election
in
november
there
could
be
an
opportunity
to
muster
the
political
will
necessary
for
passage
but
metcalfes
bill
isnt
the
only
piece
of
immigration
legislation
now
in
harrisburg
state
sen
daylin
leach
dmontgomery
introduced
a
proposal
that
would
reinforce
current
laws
and
in
the
event
of
future
changes
to
federal
law
stop
local
law
enforcement
to
serve
as
immigration
officers
it
is
very
important
that
we
make
it
clear
that
pennsylvania
does
not
support
racial
profiling
