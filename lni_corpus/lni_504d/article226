it
covers
the
waterfront
of
things
that
states

legally
do

the
area
of
illegal
immigration
it
really
places

near
the
top
of
the
list
of
states
doing
something
to
discourage
illegal
immigration

the

a
ridiculous
imposition
of
a
failed
us
immigration
policy
on
local
businesses

law
enforcement
its
a
wish
list
of

a
huge
fence
around
america
and
stretch
a
huge
bubble
over
the
country
he
said
federal
lawsuits
have
been
filed
all

microsoft
opened
an
office
in
vancouver
canada
mdivani

the
software
giant
did
so
at
least
in
part
because
