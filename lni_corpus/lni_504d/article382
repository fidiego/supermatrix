a
study
sponsored
by
an
antiimmigration
group
finds
that
us
cities
with
a
high
percentage
of
immigrants
have
a
poorer
quality
of
life
than
cities
with
a
low
percentage
the
study
out
today
by
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
is
provoking
inflamed
arguments
about
immigration
and
the
issue
is
likely
to
become
even
hotter
early
next
year
when
congress
takes
up
legislation
that
would
sharply
curtail
immigration
for
the
first
time
in
decades
advocates
for
immigrants
say
they
hope
to
derail
the
bills
or
significantly
weaken
them
those
in
favor
of
restricting
immigration
say
they
believe
the
current
high
level
of
immigration
is
bad
for
the
nation
their
report
a
tale
of
ten
cities
compares
197090
census
bureau
data
on
five
pairs
of
cities
of
similar
size
in
each
pair
one
city
has
a
high
percentage
of
immigrants
and
the
other
has
a
low
percentage
the
study
analyzes
conditions
such
as
education
income
housing
and
crime
leon
bouvier
a
demographer
at
tulane
university
conducted
the
study
his
findings
long

oakland
miami
santa

and

all
with
high
percentages
of
immigrants
have
higher
unemployment
longer
commutes
and
more
poor
people
crowding
high
school
dropouts
and
violent
crime
i
was
flabbergasted
says
bouvier
i
did
not
expect
such
radical
differences
but
some
other
researchers
question
bouviers
methods
and
conclusions
michael
fix
a
demographer
at
the
urban
institute
a
liberal
think
tank
says
bouvier
compared
busy
port
cities
to
inland
cities
and
recessionwracked
california
cities
to
heartland
cities
those
differences
could
affect
quality
of
life
even
more
than
immigration
he
says
by
not
taking
into
account
anything
but
population
he
stacks
the
deck
in
a
way
that
doesnt
make
analytic
sense
says
fix
dowell
myers
an
urban
planner
at
the
university
of
southern
california
and
an
expert
on
qualityoflife
research
says
bouviers
choice
of
cities
amounts
to
comparing
apples
to
watermelons
dan
stein
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
says
earlier
studies
have
measured
only
national
trends
not
the
effects
of
immigration
on
specific
cities
this
is
an
innovative
way
to
show
how
immigration
affects
daily
life
in
highimpact
areas
says
stein
but
a
1994
study
for
the
alexis
de
tocqueville
institution
a
probusiness
think
tank
in
virginia
compared
states
with
high
and
low
percentages
of
immigrants
it
found
unemployment
rates
were
lower
in
states
with
a
high
percentage
of
immigrants
immigration
did
not
lower
job
opportunity
in
fact
the
data
suggested
the
opposite
says
richard
vedder

of
the
