even
as
health
care
reform
twists
in
the
wind
immigration
policy
looms
as
the
next
big
political
debate
and
hispanics
and
jews
are
moving
to
the
forefront
in
a
burgeoning
political
alliance
the
next
three
months
are
seen
as
critical
in
the
fight
for
immigration
reform
but
the
weakening
of
the
democrats
grip
on
congress
with
the
recent
loss
of
a
key
massachusetts
senate
seat
does
not
bode
well
for
the
passage
of
reform
legislation
the
jewishlatino
alliance
on
immigration
issues
builds
on
the
heritage
and
experience
of
the
jewish
community
and
on
the
enthusiasm
and
urgent
needs
of
the
hispanic
community
which
has
a
strong
interest
in
issues
of
family
unification
and
the
status
of
the
some
12
million
illegal
immigrants
most
of
them
from
latin
america
but
jewish
activists
also
see
the
joint
work
as
an
opening
for
cooperation
with
the
hispanic
community
on
other
issues
such
as
israel
if
we
want
to
engage
with
the
latino
community
on
issues
that
are
of
concern
for
us
including
israel
we
need
to
engage
on
issues
that
bother
their
community
said
gideon
aronoff
president
and
ceo
of
the
hebrew
immigrant
aid
society
we
want
to
create
growing
bonds
with
the
latino
community
and
we
cannot
create
these
bonds
if
we
are
indifferent
to
the
issues
that
are
of
concern
to
them
some
advocates
view
the
ethnic
backgrounds
of
the
two
key
lawmakers
leading
the
drive
for
immigration
reform
as
symbolic
of
the
growing
alliance
on
the
issue
in
the
house
the
main
immigration
reform
bill
was
presented
rep
luis
gutierrez
an
illinois
democrat
and
in
the
senate
it
is
expected
that
new
yorks
senator
charles
schumer
will
soon
present
his
version
of
immigration
reform
legislation
the
gutierrez
bill
has
been
praised
by
advocates
for
immigrants
as
providing
answers
to
most
of
the
concerns
of
the
hispanic
community
but
so
far
it
has
failed
to
gain
any
republican
support
schumers
bill
now
in
the
making
is
expected
to
have
more
bipartisan
appeal
by
taking
a
nuanced
approach
to
the
thorny
issue
of
providing
a
path
to
legalization
for
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
while
democraticbacked
health
care
reform
legislation
was
uniformly
opposed
by
republicans
and
now
seems
to
be
stuck
in
congress
advocates
agree
that
immigration
reform
stands
no
chance
of
passage
without
bipartisan
support
but
immigration
advocates
believe
that
the
blow
suffered
by
health
care
reform
supporters
following
the
massachusetts
senate
election
does
not
necessarily
dic
tate
the
same
fate
for
immigration
reform
indeed
said
hiass
aronoff
it
might
even
help
the
cause
due
to
increased
pressure
on
lawmakers
to
show
progress
on
key
issues
all
americans
have
seen
the
gridlock
in
washington
and
are
very
frustrated
with
it
he
said
now
the
president
and
congress
need
to
show
that
they
can
solve
problems
for
americans
but
with
the
political
clock
ticking
supporters
of
reform
fear
that
major
legislation
is
becoming
harder
to
pass
and
so
they
set
the
first
half
of
2010
as
a
desired
deadline
for
passing
legislation
every
day
we
get
closer
to
the
elections
the
harder
it
becomes
said
richard
foltin
director
of
national
and
legislative
affairs
at
the
american
jewish
committee
referring
to
upcoming
congressional
elections
jewish
communal
support
for
immigration
reform
is
organized
around
several
principles
including
the
need
for
a
path
to
legalization
for
illegal
immigrants
a
mechanism
for
dealing
with
future
immigration
waves
speeding
up
work
on
family
unification
integrating
new
immigrants
into
american
society
and
finding
as
jewish
immigration
advocates
put
it
an
effective
and
humane
way
of
enforcing
immigration
laws
and
border
control
this
last
point
seems
to
be
a
growing
concern
within
the
jewish
community
said
jane
ramsey
executive
director
of
the
jewish
council
on
urban
affairs
based
in
chicago
ramsey
whose
organization
has
been
working
closely
with
hispanic
groups
stressed
that
while
both
communities
strongly
support
immigration
reform
there
is
still
a
need
to
instill
in
members
of
the
jewish
community
the
importance
of
the
issue
which
for
most
jews
carries
a
symbolic
not
personal
importance
our
community
is
one
step
removed
she
said
and
therefore
it
is
very
important
to
make
it
real
for
people
by
interacting
with
the
latino
community
while
the
jewish
organizational
world
is
essentially
united
on
this
issue
some
have
argued
that
the
jewish
rankandfile
is
not
on
entirely
the
same
page
as
communal
leaders
the
supposed
divide
between
religious
leaders
of
various
stripes
and
their
rankandfile
was
the
focus
of
a
recent
survey
sponsored
by
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
washingtonbased
group
that
opposes
granting
illegal
immigrants
a
path
to
legalization
and
instead
argues
that
many
will
return
to
their
home
countries
if
immigration
laws
are
better
enforced
that
poll
which
was
conducted
online
by
zogby
international
in
december
found
that
jews
were
roughly
equally
divided
between
those
who
prefer
a
steppedup
enforcement
approach
and
those
who
prefer
granting
legal
status
with
a
path
to
citizenship
jewish
immigration
advocates
have
questioned
the
surveys
methodology
but
they
agree
that
there
are
diverse
opinions
within
the
community
yet
the
cis
poll
also
found
that
jews
were
still
considerably
more
likely
than
members
of
other
religious
groups
to
support
granting
legal
status
to
illegal
immigrants
a
finding
that
immigration
advocates
say
rings
true
the
organized
jewish
community
is
more
committed
than
ever
to
immigration
reform
a
letter
supporting
immigration
reform
which
will
be
sent
out
to
all
senate
offices
in
early
february
was
signed
by
dozens
of
national
jewish
organizations
joining
forces
with
the
hispanic
community
has
been
a
longstanding
goal
for
jewish
groups
but
what
seems
to
be
a
rare
chance
to
reform
immigration
laws
has
helped
galvanize
the
relationship
at
a
january
10
roundtable
in
durham
n
c
jewish
and
latino
activists
shared
their
immigration
experiences
and
looked
for
ways
to
work
together
in
support
of
the
legislation
we
broke
into
groups
and
spoke
about
the
similarity
between
our
grandparents
immigration
and
their
experience
nowadays
said
stephanie
grosser
who
has
been
coordinatingoutreacheffortsforhia
s
one
of
the
issues
activists
from
both
sides
discussed
was
hate
and
hostility
directed
at
immigrants
both
past
and
presentday
whether
they
were
jewish
newcomers
at
the
turn
of
the
20th
century
or
latinos
in
recent
decades
after
we
talked
about
why
the
jewish
community
cares
about
immigration
two
latino
women
from
the
crowd
came
up
and
hugged
me
grosser
recalled
cooperation
between
the
two
communities
goes
beyond
the
issue
of
immigration
reform
and
includes
many
joint
programs
on
the
local
level
on
the
national
level
jewish
and
latino
groups
are
part
of
broader
coalitions
organizing
a
washington
rally
in
march
in
favor
of
immigration
reform
which
will
be
preceded
by
advocacy
work
in
congressional
districts
during
the
february
congressional
recess
jewish
groups
bring
to
the
table
their
experience
and
wellestablished
network
of
polit
ical
contacts
a
contribution
highly
appreciated
by
hispanic
organizers
for
us
as
newcomers
to
the
society
this
experience
is
extraordinary
said
gutavo
torres
president
of
casa
maryland
a
hispanic
group
active
in
the
metropolitan
washington
area
they
know
how
to
work
through
the
system
how
to
lobby
how
to
advocate
the
jewish
community
has
a
lot
of
experience
and
a
lot
of
power
jewish
organizations
have
been
increasing
their
efforts
to
reach
out
to
the
hispanic
community
for
several
years
and
most
national
groups
have
established
joint
programs
and
sponsored
jewishhispanic
events
with
the
rapid
growth
of
the
hispanic
community
and
with
its
rising
political
clout
jewish
groups
see
added
value
in
building
bridges
to
the
community
we
are
working
on
immigration
because
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
because
it
is
part
of
our
values
said
the
ajcs
foltin
but
the
dialogue
also
creates
better
understanding
for
the
needs
of
our
community
