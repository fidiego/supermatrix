what
immigration
could
look
like
in
the
years
to
come
social
security
cards
are
replaced
with
national
id
cards
that
use
fingerprints
or
eyeball
scans
to
identify
the
cardholder
job
applicants
are
run
through
a
national
database
that
spits
out
their
immigration
status
only
three
types
of
immigrants
are
allowed
into
the
country
temporary
provisional
and
permanent
those
and
a
host
of
other
changes
are
needed
to
overhaul
an
outdated
and
inefficient
immigration
system
if
the
country
is
going
to
get
a
handle
on
its
immigration
problems
a
respected
washington
dc
think
tank
said
in
a
report
released
wednesday
the
report
by
the
independent
task
force
on
immigration
and
americas
future
an
arm
of
the
migration
policy
institute
says
current
immigration
laws
which
date
back
to
the
1950s
need
to
be
reformed
to
keep
the
country
economically
competitive
with
the
rest
of
the
world
workers
of
all
skill
levels
need
to
be
brought
into
the
fold
legally
to
maintain
that
competitive
edge
the
report
says
the
nonpartisan
task
force
made
up
of
a
crosssection
of
elected
officials
businessmen
and
immigration
experts
released
16
recommendations
to
stave
the
tide
of
illegal
immigration
they
presented
the
report
to
the
white
house
and
congress
on
wednesday
other
suggestions
include
establishing
a
governing
body
in
the
executive
branch
to
monitor
and
recommend
changes
to
legal
immigration
levels
to
meet
labor
market
needs
integrating
the
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
already
in
the
united
states
and
setting
up
a
smart
border
that
combines
technology
equipment
and
personnel
to
keep
illegal
immigrants
from
crossing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
consider
border
security
employer
accountability
labor
enforcement
economics
family
needs
and
integration
said
lee
hamilton
a
former
representative
from
indiana
and
cochair
of
the
task
force
the
two
bills
proposed
by
the
us
house
and
the
us
senate
fail
to
do
that
he
said
you
cannot
cherrypick
in
this
process
in
order
to
have
effective
immigration
policy
hamilton
said
you
cannot
solve
one
element
of
it
and
think
youve
fixed
the
problem
the
report
did
not
say
how
much
the
recommendations
would
cost
or
how
they
should
be
paid
for
as
expected
in
the
heated
debate
over
immigration
policy
the
suggestions
did
not
sit
well
with
everyone
julia
aires
of
the
sarasotamanatee
human
rights
coalition
said
she
agrees
with
the
recommendation
to
create
a
way
for
illegal
immigrants
to
become
us
citizens
she
felt
uneasy
however
with
the
proposal
to
strengthen
the
presidents
oversight
of
immigration
policy
that
sets
off
all
kinds
of
bells
in
my
mind
aires
said
what
we
are
experiencing
right
now
is
an
executive
branch
that
is
making
decisions
without
having
decisions
from
other
government
branches
or
the
public
claude
miranda
interim
director
of
the
tampa
bay
chapter
of
the
minutemen
florida
corps
which
advocates
stricter
immigration
laws
and
better
enforcement
of
existing
ones
disagreed
with
the
multipolicy
approach
to
immigration
reform
the
border
has
to
be
closed
before
any
meaningful
immigration
reform
can
take
place
she
said
stop
the
bleeding
first
miranda
said
if
you
can
do
that
and
you
can
close
the
border
to
illegal
immigrants
then
you
can
work
out
everything
else
miranda
also
does
not
favor
letting
the
countrys
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
remain
and
would
like
to
see
their
resources
cut
off
to
deter
them
from
staying
he
said
illegal
immigrants
drain
taxpayer
dollars
from
muchneeded
social
programs
and
law
enforcement
efforts
unless
you
are
an
american
citizen
you
get
no
social
programs
no
health
care
no
welfare
no
school
we
need
to
cut
off
the
incentives
he
said
task
force
members
will
trek
to
cities
across
the
country
to
present
the
report
and
work
with
legislators
to
turn
the
recommendations
into
law
although
they
acknowledge
that
could
take
a
while
i
would
like
to
see
these
recommendations
introduced
into
a
single
bill
even
though
i
know
this
will
not
pass
this
year
and
probably
not
even
next
year
hamilton
said
the
politics
of
this
are
tough
