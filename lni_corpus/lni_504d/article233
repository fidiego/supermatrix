the
low

governor
carcieris
executive
order
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigration
met
with
backlash
yesterday
from
rhode
island
democratic
party
leaders
who
accused
him
of
mandating
racial
profiling
and
from
immigrant
advocates
who
accused
him
of
scapegoating
and
inflaming
the
debate
it
was
the
talk
of
talk
radio
positive
and
negative
the
executive
order
the
governor
signed
thursday
will
empower
state
police
and
correctional
officers
to
enforce
some
immigration
laws
through
an
agreement
with
the
federal
bureau
of
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
it
will
require
electronic
verification
of
the
legal
status
of
employees
who
work
for
the
executive
branch
and
employees
of
vendors
who
do
business
with
the
state
tim
grilo
executive
director
of
the
rhode
island
democratic
party
accused
carcieri
of
staging
another
meaningless
media
orchestration
that
was
closer
to
a
hate
rally
than
a
press
conference
doesnt
the
governor
understand
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigrants
have
legally
come
to
rhode
islands
borders
for
the
past
two
centuries
and
have
greatly
contributed
to
our
society
grilo
said
rather
than
holding
a
forum
with
leaders
of
the
minority
community
he
chose
the
low
road
and
took
another
cheap
political
shot
given
his
plummeting
publicapproval
numbers
this
looks
like
little
more
than
a
desperate
attempt
to
throw
a
little
red
meat
to
his
withering
rightwing
base
the
governors
schedule
notes
he
will
take
to
the
airwaves
on
monday
morning
on
wpro
radios
john
depetro
and
buddy
cianci
shows
meanwhile
several
community
advocacy
groups
plan
to
address
the
governors
actions
at
a
news
conference
monday
carcieri
said
he
decided
to
take
action
in
the
face
of
federal
inaction
on
immigration
reform
inaction
he
said
has
led
to
an
epidemic
flow
of
illegal
immigrants
leaving
taxpayers
to
bear
the
consequential
costs
carcieri
spokesman
jeff
neal
said
carcieri
took
action
because
many
of
the
current
bills
aimed
at
illegal
immigration
were
introduced
but
failed
to
pass
the
general
assembly
last
year
and
as
a
result
it
is
not
clear
that
these
bills
will
be
approved
this
year
carcieri
reviewed
similar
policies
including
executive
orders
in
a
number
of
different
jurisdictions
including
tennessee
south
carolina
georgia
idaho
montana
missouri
arizona
florida
oregon
and
oklahoma
neal
said
he
consulted
ice
and
other
governors
carcieri
said
thursday
he
was
aware
that
the
topic
of
illegal
immigration
stirs
great
emotion
and
is
a
very
sensitive
issue
at
several
points
he
blamed
the
media
for
ratcheting
up
the
rhetoric
yesterday
critics
said
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot
hes
the
one
thats
inflaming
the
debate
said
ali
noorani
executive
director
of
the
massachusetts
immigrant
refugee
advocacy
coalition
which
partners
with
rhode
island
advocacy
organizations
the
governor
has
scapegoated
the
immigration
population
for
political
gain
and
along
the
way
has
undermined
the
safety
of
each
and
every
resident
of
rhode
island
noorani
said
if
you
look
or
sound
like
an
immigrant
theres
no
reason
to
ever
trust
rhode
island
state
troopers
noorani
added
once
a
victim
does
not
feel
safe
reporting
a
crime
the
criminal
wins
thats
the
net
result
of
the
executive
order
that
the
governor
signed
many
people
called
talkradio
shows
yesterday
to
praise
carcieri
including
buddy
tassoni
of
johnston
tassoni
is
a
member
of
rhode
islanders
for
immigration
law
enforcement
a
group
opposed
to
illegal
immigration
and
amnesty
for
undocumented
immigrants
i
applaud
the
governor
for
having
the
backbone
that
our
congressional
delegates
dont
have
tassoni
said
he
added
this
is
a
nation
of
immigrants
as
the
governor
stated
and
we
certainly
welcome
all
that
will
comply
with
our
immigration
laws
he
said
he
also
called
his
congressional
leaders
to
tell
them
the
governor
had
to
do
something
because
they
dropped
the
ball
riile
president
terry
gorman
said
he
was
extremely
pleased
with
the
governors
action
i
think
its
long
overdue
and
i
think
this
tremendous
reaction
from
this
opposite
side
of
the
issue
is
because
theyre
very
nervous
about
the
magnitude
of
this
situation
being
exposed
carcieris
actions
were
being
noted
outside
rhode
island
bob
dane
spokesman
for
the
conservative
national
group
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
said
carcieri
will
be
in
good
company
he
called
the
287
g
program
that
gives
state
police
immigration
powers
a
kind
of
forcemultiplier
its
a
good
program
its
not
cops
working
as
immigration
officers
as
much
as
its
cops
working
more
closely
with
the
immigration
officers
dane
added
so
much
of
the
immigration
fight
is
moving
from
inside
the
beltway
here
in
washington
to
cities
and
states
across
the
country
the
local
communities
in
the
states
are
doing
the
work
the
federal
government
isnt
doing
and
wont
do
angela
kelley
director
of
the
immigration
policy
center
a
research
arm
of
the
american
immigration
law
foundation
said
that
federal
action
not
executive
orders
by
governors
is
the
way
to
go
i
think
an
executive
order
is
a
good
way
to
do
business
if
youre
trying
to
send
a
message
but
its
not
a
terribly
effective
way
to
solve
the
problem
said
kelley
the
majority
of
local
initiatives
try
to
send
a
tough
message
of
cracking
down
on
folks
perhaps
naïvely
hoping
theyll
leave
i
do
think
its
naïve
were
not
talking
about
an
insignificant
number
of
people
there
are
12
million
undocumented
people
7
to
8
million
of
them
are
workers
and
we
have
3
to
5
million
us
citizen
kids
where
one
or
more
parents
are
undocumented
thats
why
i
think
its
about
sending
a
message
said
kelley
i
dont
think
anyone
really
believes
theyre
going
to
go
