a
number
of
colorado
police
chiefs
say
it
would
be
a
bad
idea  to
let
their
officers
make
immigration
arrests
despite
a
bill  being
considered
by
state
legislators
that
would
give
them
the  power
to
do
just
that
the
bill
scheduled
to
be
debated
in
the
house
this
week  would
authorize
local
and
state
police
to
arrest
individuals
on  immigration
violations
an
authority
normally
limited
to
the
us  immigration
and
naturalization
service
advocates
including
the
bills
sponsor
rep
don
lee  rlittleton
say
the
measure
would
be
a
way
for
colorado
to  contribute
to
the
war
against
terrorism
he
said
the
state
should  lend
a
hand
to
a
beleaguered
federal
agency
that
doesnt
have
the  resources
nor
staff
to
detain
the
estimated
8
million
undocumented  immigrants
now
in
the
united
states
but
several
police
chiefs
across
colorado
say
they
dont
have  the
money
or
the
training
to
turn
their
departments
into
an  extension
of
the
ins
worse
yet
they
say
the
mandate
could
make  it
harder
to
do
their
main
job
fighting
crime
communication
is
big
in
innercity
neighborhoods
and
the  underpinning
of
that
is
trust
said
denver
police
chief
gerry  whitman
whose
officers
are
specifically
prohibited
from
making  immigration
arrests
unless
another
crime
is
involved
if
a
victim  thinks
theyre
going
to
be
a
suspect
in
an
immigration
  violation
theyre
not
going
to
call
us
and
thats
just
going
to  separate
us
even
further
likewise
glenwood
springs
chief
terry
wilson
said
thats
a  whole
different
area
of
law
that
we
have
to
come
up
to
speed
on  we
have
enough
on
our
plates
right
now
its
not
as
if
were
out  looking
for
extra
things
to
do
federal
immigration
authorities
say
they
increasingly
see  deputizing
local
and
state
police
as
a
way
to
boost
the
agencys  available
resources
in
the
face
of
growing
criticism
after
the  sept
11
attacks
of
the
nearly
37000
ins
employees
only
about
2000
are  agents
dedicated
to
enforcing
immigration
laws
inside
the
united  states
and
their
efforts
traditionally
focus
on
immigrants
who  have
committed
other
crimes
such
as
robbery
or
assault
under
the
provisions
of
a
1996
immigration
law
local
and  state
police
can
engage
in
immigration
enforcement
only
if
they  first
sign
a
memorandum
of
agreement
with
the
justice
department  and
their
officers
undergo
extensive
training
early
this
month
the
justice
department
announced
that
it
was  reconsidering
those
restrictions
but
here
in
colorado
police
chiefs
say
one
of
biggest  problems
is
that
in
the
rush
to
plug
enforcement
leaks
federal  officials
and
state
lawmakers
have
forgotten
that
most
officers  have
no
expertise
in
immigration
law
and
no
experience
in
its  enforcement
police
officers
are
trained
from
day
1
that
to
make
an  arrest
they
must
have
a
legal
standard
that
legal
standard
is  probable
cause
colorado
springs
acting
chief
luis
velez
said  the
problem
is
youll
have
police
who
are
trained
to
deal
with  criminals
instead
of
dealing
with
people
who
are
in
effect
status
offenders
experts
say
that
except
for
major
offenses
such
as
immigrant  smuggling
or
returning
to
the
united
states
after
being
deported  most
immigration
offenses
are
civil
offenders
cant
be
tried
or
sentenced
to
prison
but
they
also  dont
enjoy
most
dueprocess
protections
such
as
trial
by
judge  or
jury
or
the
right
of
appeal
immigration
lawyers
say
that
without
those
safeguards
a  change
in
the
law
could
allow
serious
mistakes
by
untrained  officers
or
even
abuse
of
police
power
immigration
law
is
very
very
complicated
no
local  policeman
has
training
at
all
in
civil
immigration
law
you
have  to
know
what
a
violation
is
know
how
to
apprehend
somebody
know  what
happens
after
you
take
somebody
into
civil
custody
said  roxanna
bacon
a
phoenix
immigration
lawyer
the
difference
is
  that
one
is
protected
by
the
us
constitution
at
every
step
the  other
is
a
civil
matter
its
the
settlement
of
a
status
crime
lee
the
bills
sponsor
emphasized
that
the
legislation  wouldnt
require
local
and
state
police
to
enforce
immigration  laws
it
only
would
give
them
that
authority
if
they
choose
to
use  it
local
departments
would
be
encouraged
to
meet
with
the
ins  and
work
out
an
agreement
to
cooperate
directly
with
the
service  lee
said
of
the
legislation
which
also
includes
a
requirement  that
an
immigrants
drivers
license
expire
at
the
same
time
as  his
or
her
visa
this
is
a
specific
attempt
to
do
our
part
as
a
state
in  helping
the
ins
deal
with
issues
that
have
come
up
since
