both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
can
agree
on
one
thing
congress
and
president
bush
have
failed
in
tackling
the
issue
this
has
caused
a
record
number
of
bills
to
be
introduced
in
this
years
general
assembly
session
immigration
advocates
estimate
that
about
50
proposals
were
offered
this
year
lawmakers
seeking
to
toughen
state
laws
contend
the
measures
are
needed
to
fill
a
void
caused
by
the
inaction
of
federal
officials
one
thing
is
very
clear
virginia
state
legislators
are
frustrated
with
congress
failure
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
said
tim
freilich
legal
director
of
the
virginia
justice
center
for
farm
and
immigrant
workers
who
called
40
of
the
measures
negative
bills
cover
among
other
topics
education
law
enforcement
the
workplace
restricting
public
benefits
and
combating
human
trafficking
at
a
news
conference
this
month
some
house
republicans
cited
their
frustrations
with
the
white
house
as
a
republican
i
am
deeply
disappointed
in
the
leadership
on
the
issue
by
president
bush
said
del
john
s
reid
rhenrico
who
has
introduced
about
a
halfdozen
measures
that
would
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
i
agree
with
him
on
many
issues
but
on
this
one
i
am
disappointed
reids
bills
include
one
preventing
virginia
companies
from
firing
legal
workers
without
cause
if
businesses
knowingly
employ
illegal
immigrants
and
one
prohibiting
illegal
immigrants
from
paying
instate
tuition
at
public
colleges
and
universities
people
are
contacting
their
legislators
because
they
do
not
like
the
idea
that
people
are
coming
over
here
illegally
with
impunity
reid
said
in
an
interview
last
week
this
is
a
federal
issue
and
the
federal
government
should
deal
with
it
but
in
their
absence
of
dealing
with
it
the
state
and
localities
should
those
who
favor
tougher
immigration
laws
contend
its
a
fairness
issue
and
that
its
unfair
to
those
immigrants
who
followed
the
rules
we
cannot
turn
the
cheek
of
indifference
to
the
flagrant
violation
of
our
immigration
laws
republican
lt
gov
bill
bolling
said
at
the
news
conference
many
of
the
bills
seeking
to
toughen
immigration
laws
come
from
northern
virginia
republicans
whose
region
contains
some
of
the
highest
numbers
of
foreignborn
residents
in
previous
years
similar
proposals
have
cleared
the
more
conservative
house
and
died
in
the
more
moderate
senate
one
virginian
in
10
was
born
outside
the
country
between
250000
and
300000
illegal
immigrants
live
in
virginia
studies
show
most
of
whom
are
hispanic
immigration
reform
is
expected
to
come
before
the
democratcontrolled
congress
which
analysts
believe
is
more
open
to
immigration
changes
than
the
previous
gop
leadership
bush
addressed
the
need
for
immigration
reform
during
his
state
of
the
union
address
last
week
which
drew
applause
from
congressional
democrats
during
a
news
conference
last
week
immigration
advocates
called
many
of
the
proposed
virginia
bills
harmful
signaling
out
proposals
they
say
would
hurt
children
and
businesses
a
bill
that
would
have
required
school
officials
to
examine
immigration
documents
of
children
born
outside
the
united
states
was
later
tabled
in
the
house
education
committee
many
of
the
bills
concern
law
enforcement
such
as
those
giving
state
and
local
officials
the
ability
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
advocates
say
that
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
immigrant
communities
and
their
relationship
with
police
this
month
republican
attorney
general
bob
mcdonnell
urged
democratic
gov
timothy
m
kaine
to
let
some
state
agencies
among
them
the
virginia
state
police
enter
into
an
agreement
with
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
to
give
them
those
powers
in
the
investigation
of
certain
violent
crimes
kaine
has
declined
saying
he
didnt
want
virginia
taxpayers
picking
up
the
bill
for
a
federal
responsibility
and
that
it
could
undermine
current
agreements
with
the
federal
immigration
agency
a
bill
to
require
that
the
state
enter
into
such
an
agreement
is
pending
if
legislators
want
to
address
immigration
reform
