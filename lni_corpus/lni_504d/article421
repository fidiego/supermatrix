america
a
nation
of
immigrants
is
turning
its
back
on
its
newest
arrivals
with
antiimmigration
sentiment
now
as
high
as
its
been
at
anytime
since
world
war
ii
a
usa
todaycnngallup
poll
shows
the
blacklash
against
the
record
number
of
immigrants
running
broad
and
deep
stoked
by
anxiety
over
the
stagnant
economy
the
failure
to
curb
illegal
immigration
and
immigration
advocates
charge
nothing
short
of
racism
although
relatively
few
americans
say
they
have
much
contact
with
new
immigrants
nearly
twothirds
of
those
polled
want
immigration
decreased
the
highest
percentage
since
the
mid1940s
in
addition
56
believe
immigrants
cost
taxpayers
money
and
55
say
the
racial
and
ethnic
diversity
of
immigrants
threatens
american
culture
my
nightmare
is
an
image
of
the
statue
of
liberty
dissolving
replaced
by
an
image
of
the
bombed
world
trade
center
and
the
association
of
immigrants
with
smuggling
drugs
and
terrorism
says
arthur
helton
immigration
expert
for
the
lawyers
committee
for
human
rights
conjuring
the
images
may
be
the
sheer
numbers
a
historic
and
massive
movement
to
this
country
led
by
hispanic
and
asian
immigrants
about
95
million
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
came
to
the
usa
between
198090
the
largest
number
in
any
decade
since
the
nations
founding
in
my
district
no
issue
compares
to
illegal
aliens
people
just
go
berserk
says
rep
tony
beilenson
dcalif
who
represents
los
angeles
where
immigrants
make
up
a
major
proportion
of
the
population
those
who
favor
curbs
congress
is
considering
several
say
the
emma
lazarus
poem
on
the
statue
of
liberty
is
irrelevant
the
last
thing
needed
today
the
argument
goes
is
huddled
masses
its
a
poem
not
policy
says
rosemary
jenks
senior
analyst
at
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
washington
thinktank
that
advocates
reducing
immigration
it
never
was
policy
and
we
never
said
we
wanted
to
open
our
arms
historians
take
the
uproar
with
a
grain
of
salt
fiftyfour
million
immigrants
have
come
to
the
usa
since
1820
and
the
publics
response
has
been
at
best
ambivalent
and
at
worst
racist
and
violent
the
latest
round
of
recriminations
over
immigrants
has
been
prompted
at
least
in
part
by
recent
headlines
boatloads
of
chinese
peasants
trying
to
sneak
into
us
ports
haitians
with
the
aids
virus
ordered
let
in

in
connection
with

york
bomb
plots
an
egyptian
cleric
who
somehow
got
in
and
now
cant
be
immediately
kicked
out
it
is
a
debate
punctuated
with
apocalyptic
rhetoric
one
side
says
the
united
states
especially
california
texas
florida
and
new
york
is
being
invaded
by
immigrants
who
crowd
neighborhoods
take
jobs
cost
money
and
change
the
culture
were
at
the
floodstage
and
we
have
been
for
the
past
six
years
says
robert
goldsborough
president
of
americans
for
immigration
control
a
group
that
backs
a
temporary
moratorium
on
immigration
even
president
clinton
has
adopted
the
vocabulary
of
immigration
opponents
saying
the
chief
goal
of
his
nominee
to
head
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
would
be
to
ensure
the
usa
doesnt
lose
control
of
our
borders
immigrant
advocates
on
the
other
hand
use
words
like
racism
and
xenophobia
to
describe
feelings
of
their
opponents
they
say
immigrants
create
jobs
pay
their
taxes
build
communities
and
add
vitality
to
the
culture
theres
this
image
being
created
of
a
white
minority
encircled
by
hispanics
africans
and
asians
coming
to
take
something
we
have
rather
than
contributing
to
make
us
all
better
says
frank
sharry
head
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
coalition
of
advocate
groups
in
washington
fierce
and
emotional
the
debate
has
reached
congress
where
many
members
have
concluded
that
the
1986
law
meant
to
fix
the
immigration
problem
failed
miserably
proposals
being
debated
tightening
up
the
political
asylum
system
to
allow
immigration
officers
to
immediately
turn

people
with
suspected
fraudulent

patrol
agents
requiring
a
fraudproof
national
id
card
for
every
citizen
to
prevent
illegal
immigrants
from
getting
jobs
even
the
advocates
for
immigrants
want
to
repeal
the
1986
law
which
among
other
things
bans
hiring
of
illegal
immigrants
the
advocates
argue
that
employer
sanctions
have
caused
widespread
discrimination
against
citizens
and
legal
residents
who
seem
foreign
but
advocates
fear
a
gettough
attitude
will
prevail
were
right
on
the
verge
of
a
new
era
of
antiimmigrant
hysteria
that
could
push
us
in
the
direction
of
policies
based
on
misperceptions
says
lucas
guttentag
of
the
immigrant
rights
project
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
the
usa
todaycnn
gallup
poll
reflects
some
of
those
attitudes
twothirds
say
immigrants
take
lowpaying
jobs
that
most
americans
dont
want
at
the
same
time
64
say
immigrants
hurt
the
economy
by
driving
down
wages
many
are
uncomfortable
with
the
rising
numbers
of
blacks
and
hispanics
arriving
about
twothirds
believe
too
many
immigrants
are
coming
from
latin
america
asian
and
mideast
countries
while
only
33
say
too
many
are
coming
from
european
countries
many
are
willing
to
embrace
some
controversial
remedies
fiftyseven
percent
back
the
idea
of
a
national
id
40
would
deny
illegal
immigrants
use
of
hospitals
and
schools
some
critics
say
the
current
mood
could
lead
to
immigranttargeted
violence
of
the
kind
now
prevalent
in
germany
and
other
european
countries
if
leaders
do
not
address
the
publics
legitimate
concerns
that
leaves
the
door
open
for
demagogues
to
take
over
warns
ira
mehlman
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
leading
antiimmigration
group
but
lawrence
fuchs
acting
chairman
of
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
thinks
thats
unlikely
today
he
argues
mainstream
politicians
no
longer
warn
of
inferior
immigrants
as
generations
did
before
foreignborn
residents
now
make
up
79
of
the
population
compared
with
about
15
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
today
most
new
immigrants
come
here
under
family
reunification
laws
says
fuchs
people
will
say
on
surveys
theyre
against
more
immigration
but
when
their
neighbor
calls
them
up
and
says
ive
petitioned
for
my
spouse
and
little
children
to
come
here
the
next
thing
out
of
the
neighbors
mouth
will
be
what
can
i
do
to
help
