its
hard
to
imagine
on
the
cusp
of
the
allamerican
july
4
holiday
anything
more
inappropriate
than
the
rising
clamor
for
sharp
reductions
in
immigration
our
nation
today
is
the
product
of
centuries
of
welcome
theres
no
need
to
change
now
yet
public
fears
of
illegal
immigration
fueled
by
the
california
experience
and
antiimmigration
cheerleaders
who
see
danger
in
changing
the
nations
ethnic
mix
are
giving
nativism
new
life
preserve
us
they
say
from
those
who
do
not
share
our
culture
from
those
who
in
their
numbers
would
change
our
racial
balance
and
threaten
our
world
several
proposals
in
congress
would
curtail
legal
immigration
or
stop
it
entirely
and
polls
show
americans
believe
immigrants
take
jobs
and
drain
social
services
those
are
fears
without
a
valid
cause
a
threepart
series
by
staff
writer
maria
puente
the
second
installment
of
which
appears
today
shows
the
wall
builders
are
wrong
in
many
significant
ways
immigrants
are
indistinguishable
from
natives
indeed
a
landmark
usa
today
cnngallup
poll
of
immigrants
to
be
published
in
detail
wednesday
shows
that
immigrants
hold
the
same
dreams
and
cherish
the
same
opportunities
and
freedoms
as
everyone
else
in
one
telling
statistic
three
in
five
immigrants
agree
that
blending
in
is
best
thats
the
same
ratio
as
among
natives
and
it
speaks
volumes
about
who
our
immigrants
want
to
be
new
immigrants
do
indeed
cluster
in
certain
regions
cities
and
communities
and
that
can
produce
localized
difficulties
but
studies
by
the
freemarketoriented
cato
institute
find
no
negative
correlation
between
immigration
and
unemployment
or
wages
and
numerous
other
studies
including
one
done
by
the
authoritative
urban
institute
show
that
excluding
refugees
immigrants
use
social
services
at
about
the
same
rate
as
natives
so
why
the
panic
much
of
it
comes
from
nativists
who
exploit
public
frustration
with
illegal
immigration
about
300000
people
a
year
to
build
opposition
to
legal
immigration
about
800000
people
a
year
thats
a
dangerous
mixup
especially
when
it
results
in
moratoriumtalk
reason
emma
lazarus
got
it
slightly
wrong
we
do
not
take
just
huddled
masses
we
take
the
best
the
world
can
offer
one
study
by
the
brookings
institution
found
that
between
1950
and
1970
immigrants
arrived
with
8
billion
worth
of
human
capital
education
and
other
skills
each
year
that
brain
gain
has
diminished
since
but
even
a
partial
moratorium
would
do
more
damage
by
limiting
the
ability
of
immigration
to
offset
the
loss
of
the
200000
americans
who
leave
the
country
every
year
a
complete
halt
to
immigration
would
be
even
more
harmful
it
could
not
keep
illegal
immigrants
out
a
sensible
goal
to
pursue
instead
it
would
keep
out
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
deserve
a
place
here
and
contribute
to
the
nation
skilled
workers
refugees
and
the
largest
category
of
all
spouses
and
children
of
our
own
citizens
do
we
let
in
too
many
immigrants
hard
to
see
how
about
8
of
us
today
are
foreign
born
compared
to
15
between
1870
and
1920
and
if
1
million
people
arrive
every
year
what
noticeable
impact
can
that
have
on
a
nation
of
260
million
of
course
the
new
nativism
isnt
new
at
all
germans
jews
italians
chinese
what
race
or
ethnicity
has
not
at
one
time
been
maligned
as
a
threat
to
the
american
identity
and
who
among
them
is
not
now
an
integral
part
of
it
yes
much
can
be
done
to
improve
the
immigration
system
and
much
should
be
done
to
confront
illegal
immigration
but
a
moratorium
on
legal
immigration
grossly
misunderstands
and
endangers
the
american
experience
we
are
not
a
homogenous
nation
we
never
have
been
we
are
