number
of
times
ger
the
hebrew
word
for
stranger
or
immigrant
appears
in
the
bible
the
time
frame
also
underscores
the
approach
religious
organizations
take
on
immigration
which
isnt
always
political
for
us
its
not
most
about
politics
its
most
about
bible
teaching
and
relationships
said
leith
anderson
president
of
the
national
association
of
evangelicals
and
one
of
the
principals
of
the
coalition
which
is
comprised
of
liberal
conservative
and
latino
leaders
of
the
national
evangelical
community
the
bible
teaches
how
people
should
treat
their
neighbors
and
newcomers
to
the
land
he
said
and
evangelicals
interact
with
immigrants
at
church
in
schools
and
in
the
immigrants
native
countries
where
missionaries
have
worked
for
generations
the
evangelical
immigration
tables

follows
calls
from
other
business
and
political
groups
since
last
weeks
election
for
the
president
and
congress
to
reach
a
bipartisan
solution
to
immigration
the
letters
are
the
evangelical
groups
second
attempt
this
year
to
put
immigration
on
congress
radar
since
election
day
however
a
political
window
has
opened
that
influenced
the
trio
of
letters
the
evangelical
immigration
table
sent
out
tuesday
last
week
house
speaker
john
boehner
rohio
urged
obama
to
take
the
lead
in
coming
up
with
a
plan
that
would
look
at
both
improved
enforcement
of
immigration
law
and
the
future
of
the
estimated
11
million
people
living
in
the
country
illegally
over
the
weekend
democrat
chuck
schumer
of
new
york
and
republican
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
also
disclosed
they
have
resumed
talks
on
immigration
policy
that
broke
off
two
years
ago
and
have
put
together
an
immigration
reform
blueprint
that
has
the
real
potential
for
bipartisan
support
based
on
the
theory
that
most
americans
are
for
legal
immigration
but
very
much
against
illegal
immigration
anderson
said
those
comments
show
the
political
momentum
is
moving
toward
immigration
reform
we
have
a
unique
moment
right
now
to
achieve
this
goal
and
we
plan
to
move
forward
with
it

vice
president
for
public
policy
and
research
at
the
ethics
and
religious
liberty
commission
of
the
southern
baptist
convention
in
their
letters
the
evangelical
immigration
table
asks
that
the
bipartisan
solution
respect
the
godgiven
dignity
of
every
person
protect
the
unity
of
the
immediate
family
respect
the
rule
of
law
guarantee
secure
national
borders
ensure
fairness
to
taxpayers
and
establish
a
path
toward
legal
status
or
citizenship
immigration
policy
has
been
largely
ignored
since
president
george
w
bushs
proposal
for
reform
died
in
2007
immigration
was
seldom
a
topic
mentioned
from
the
pulpit
during
church
services
leading
up
to
the
2012
election
surveys
by
the
pew
research
center
showed
abortion
and
samesex
marriage
were
more
often
preached
to
churchgoers
from
the
minority
of
pastors
who
chose
to
speak
about
politics
but
the
issue
has
resurfaced
as
a
way
for
republicans
to
rebound
from
their
election
performance
in
which
more
than
70
percent
of
hispanic
voters
supported
obama
who
has
committed
to
addressing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
in
2013
hispanic
evangelicals
make
up
10
percent
of
the
electorate
and
in
the
coming
years
that
number
will
grow
said
rev
gabriel
salguero
president
of
the
national
latino
evangelical
coalition
this
election
season
split
our
country
but
today
we
come
together
in
an
unprecedented
show
of
unity
within
the
evangelical
community
black

hispanic
and
asian
the
evangelical
immigration
table
first
unveiled
its
immigration
reform
plan
to
congress
in
june
and
urged
them
to
address
the
issue
the
during
the
election
year
the
table
represents
about
150
evangelical
organizations
across
the
country
that
includes
thousands
of
churches
and
millions
of
protestant
churchgoers
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
mormon
have
also
signed
on
and
supported
local
efforts
for
comprehensive
and
compassionate
immigration
reform
state
lawmakers
including
utahs
legislature
have
also
moved
ahead
during
the
past
five
years
with
their
own
immigration
initiatives
some
of
which
have
been
challenged
in
federal
court
for
overstepping
into
federal
jurisdiction
business
labor
and
local
governments
are
also
organizing
to
push
for
immigration
reform
these
coalitions
of
strange
bedfellows
in
faith
business
and
government
should
give
the
president
and
congress
the
political
will
to
reach
a
bipartisan
solution
to
immigration
said
jeremy
robbins
director
of
the
partnership
for
a
new
american
economy
a
bipartisan
coalition
of
500
mayors
and
business
leaders
making
a
case
for
immigration
reform
the
reality
is
there
are
a
lot
of
extremely
persuasive
reasons
for
immigration
reform
and
different
ones
resonate
with
different
groups
robbins
said
the
evangelical
vote
is
a
huge
portion
of
the
electorate
so
the
letters
from
the
evangelical
immigration
table
should
have
huge
influence
on
the
push
for
reform
