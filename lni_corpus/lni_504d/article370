a
i
can
see
the
argument
behind
the
257to163
vote
in
the
house
last
week
to
allow
states
to
deny
illegal
immigrant
children
a
publicschool
education
government
shouldnt
reward
families
that
violate
americas
immigration
laws
with
free
schooling
that
said
this
republican
house
ought
to
be
paddled
for
passing
the
above
amendment
while
voting
against
requiring
employers
to
verify
with
immigration
authorities
that
each
job
applicant
is
legal
if
the
day
should
come
when
the
government
has
to
deny
children
access
to
an
education
so
be
it
but
surely
that
day
cannot
have
arrived
if
congress
a
the
senate
abandoned
tough
employer
penalties
earlier
a
doesnt
feel
a
need
to
ensure
that
employers
obey
the
law
instead
the
house
passed
a
voluntary
a
read
nambypamby
a
verification
bill
verification
but
only
for
the
lawabiding
hey
what
a
concept
once
again
congress
is
talking
tough
and
legislating
light
if
this
donothing
bill
ever
is
signed
into
law
it
will
change
little
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
americas
premier
immigration
limitation
group
was
so
disgusted
with
what
the
republicans
and
democrats
did
last
week
that
it
withdrew
its
support
for
the
two
major
bills
in
congress
they
decided
to
get
tough
with
school
kids
before
they
got
tough
with
employers
which
is
where
they
really
need
to
start
fair
spokesman
ira
mehlman
explained
we
need
to
cut
up
the
magnet
of
public
services
but
the
real
magnet
is
jobs
and
weve
got
to
deal
with
that
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
have
a
mandatory
verification
process
without
that
nothing
else
is
going
to
work
roy
beck
author
of
the
case
against
immigration
supports
the
no
school
amendment
and
still
is
disgusted
with
the
house
measure
the
members
of
the
house
basically
turned
their
backs
on
the
american
people
said
beck
republicans
are
hoping
that
voters
will
be
gullible
enough
to
believe
that
at
least
the
gop
tried
to
do
something
about
immigration
dont
believe
it
the
courts
would
stop
the
noschool
provision
in
a
heartbeat
and
tie
it
up
for
years
if
you
asked
the
gop
house
whom
it
cared
about
more
corporations
or
constituents
you
couldnt
have
gotten
a
clearer
answer
the
anti
verification
vote
was
a
vote
for
cheap
labor
and
feckless
enforcement
of
employment
laws
president
bill
clinton
and
other
corporate
lapdog
democrats
are
no
better
clinton
having
endorsed
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reforms
call
to
limit
legal
immigration
folded
last
week
when
he
supported
efforts
to
end
a
proposed
limit
a
then
said
he
still
supports
limiting
legal
immigration

you
