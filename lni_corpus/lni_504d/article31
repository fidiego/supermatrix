vela
dbrownsville
an
ardent
supporter
of
immigration
reform
said
he
is
more
optimistic
now
than
he
was
a
few
months
ago
that
a
federal
immigration
overhaul
will
be
passed
by
congress
vela
said
the
bipartisan
budget
deal
passed
before
the
holiday
break
is
representative
of
the
work
that
will
be
produced
over
the
next
three
weeks
over
the
next
three
weeks
we
will
see
bipartisan
actions
on
the
farm
bill
and
the
water
resources
development
act
vela
said
there
seems
to
be
some
traction
with
respect
to
getting
things
done
that
said
vela
is
cautious
about
saying
immigration
law
will
be
set
this
year
even
though
i
am
more
optimistic
i
still
think
its
going
to
be
very
difficult
he
added
government
professor
guadalupe
correacabrera
is
not
as
optimistic
its
a
complicated
situation
and
the
possibilities
are
very
low
for
president
barack
obama
to
achieve
his
goal
of
passing
immigration
said
correacabrera
who
teaches
at
the
university
of
texas
at
brownsville
correacabrera
said
there
is
no
real
consensus
among
supporters
of
immigration
legislation
while
the
voices
against
it
grow
louder
i
see
very
few
possibilities
of
this
having
a
happy
ending
in
this
administration
correacabrera
said
i
think
there
are
more
problems
that
need
to
be
solved
the
us
senate
approved
a
bill
that
would
overhaul
immigration
legislation
back
in
june
but
the
ushouse
of
representatives
said
it
would
only
consider
immigration
reform
through
a
piecemeal
approach
during
last
years
discussions
house
republicans
said
they
would
consider
immigration
reform
as
long
as
the
border
was
first
secured
it
was
a
compromise
that
was
agreed
on
by
legislators
but
correacabrera
said
it
was
unnecessary
correacabrera
cites
the
number
of
border
apprehensions
and
the
large
number
of
deportations
as
proof
that
the
border
is
secure
theres
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
security
in
the
border
is
getting
worse
she
said
there
are
more
reasons
to
believe
its
getting
better
advocates
of
immigration
reform
say
that
discussions
on
immigration
and
a
pathway
to
citizenship
are
likely
to
begin
in
the
spring
or
summer
after
filing
deadlines
for
the
2014
midterm
elections
have
passed
vela
who
is
supportive
of
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
those
in
the
country
illegally
said
currently
he
would
not
support
legislation
that
does
not
have
a
deal
where
the
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
country
would
be
granted
citizenship
in
a
statement
frank
sherry
executive
director
of
americas
voice
as
its
been
reported
said
some
house
republicans
say
there
should
be
an
approach
to
grant
a
legal
status
to
those
in
the
country
illegally
and
at
a
later
time
determine
who
should
become
a
citizen
advocates
are
often
asked
could
we
live
with
such
a
proposal
our
answer
until
we
see
such
a
proposal
detailed
its
impossible
to
say
sherry
said
we
have
been
clear
from
the
beginning
that
our
priority
is
an
inclusive
path
to
initial
legal
status
and
an
achievable
path
to
eventual
citizenship
for
the
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
in
america
correacabrera
the
utb
professor
said
this
isnt
the
optimal
outcome
but
it
could
serve
as
a
starting
point
on
a
very
difficult
discussion
in
my
opinion
i
think
that
would
help
to
open
space
for
a
discussion
in
the
near
future
and
i
think
that
is
positive
correacabrera
said
whatever
we
can
gain
regarding
the
possibility
of
undocumented
migrants
to
be
able
to
stay
in
the
country
any
gain
would
be
positive
because
it
generates
a
precedent
its
not
the
best
ending
she
added
vela
said
there
are
some
conservative
members
of
congress
that
would
approve
of
legislation
that
would
grant
legalization
for
the
countrys
undocumented
immigrants
but
not
grant
citizenship
he
would
not
approve
of
that
right
now
vela
said
my
concern
with
that
is
all
of
a
sudden
youve
got
a
secondclass
citizenry
vela
said
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
evaluate
it
when
these
proposals
come
up
