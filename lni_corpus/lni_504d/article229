before
house
bill
1804
went
into
effect
in
november
tulsa
county
sheriff
stanley
glanz
was
vigilant
in
enforcing
federal
immigration
law
since
then
he
has
had
more
than
30
deputies
trained
in
enforcing
federal
immigration
law
he
has
helped
deport
more
than
a
1000
illegal
immigrants
from
tulsa
county
he
boasts
of
a
7
percent
decline
in
jail
population
and
hes
enjoyed
growing
popularity
among
a
vocal
element
of
residents
in
this
election
year
glanz
is
unopposed
i
do
think
immigration
has
been
a
part
of
this
absolutely
said
carol
helm
director
of
immigration
reform
for
oklahoma
now
he
has
certainly
been
an
enforcer
of
the
rule
of
law
and
the
statistics
prove
it
that
is
exactly
what
the
citizens
want
and
thats
exactly
why
the
bill
was
passed
in
the
first
place
immigration
reform
for
oklahoma
now
based
in
jenks
is
a
grassroots
antiillegal
immigration
group
one
of
hundreds
across
the
nation
that
make
up
the
movement
immigration
reform
for
oklahoma
now
like
other
oklahoma
antiillegal
immigration
groups
such
as
outraged
patriots
based
in
beggs
and
oksafe
based
in
oklahoma
city
is
loosely
affiliated
with
national
groups
such
as
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
numbersusa
and
the
center
for
immigration
studies
in
oklahoma
there
are
roughly
35000
to
40000
oklahoma
residents
who
are
active
in
these
groups
helm
said
other
law
officers
enforcement
criticized
in
advance
of
tuesdays
primary
election
helm
and
others
have
spent
the
past
month
rallying
behind
officials
who
support
their
ideology
they
also
are
working
to
unseat
those
they
perceive
as
being
nonsupportive
or
lackadaisical
in
their
enforcement
of
the
rule
of
law
the
antiillegal
immigrant
network
has
focused
on
sheriff
judge
and
district
attorney
elections
offices
that
have
the
most
discretion
in
determining
how
hb
1804
and
federal
immigration
law
is
enforced
while
the
groups
support
glanzs
work
they
have
vocally
criticized
other
sheriffs
for
what
they
see
as
a
lack
of
vigilance
helm
said
the
state
is
filled
with
elected
law
enforcement
officials
who
are
failing
to
do
their
job
when
it
comes
to
immigration
enforcement
i
talk
to
a
lot
of
folks
all
over
everywhere
from
altus
to
woodward
to
miami
helm
said
i
think
the
entire
state
is
tired
of
the
drain
on
the
local
communities
the
local
communities
are
in
worse
shape
than
tulsa
and
you
know
how
bad
that
is
some
people
think
immigration
is
a
federal
issue
but
so
is
robbing
a
bank
you
just
dont
ignore
it
when
you
see
it
happening
said
glanz
who
says
he
has
reduced
crime
by
enforcing
immigration
laws
this
position
has
not
been
supported
by
the
tulsa
police
department
which
has
reported
a
slight
increase
in
crime
due
largely
to
criminals
targeting
illegal
immigrants
i
dont
think
they
understand
the
implications
on
the
community
of
having
a
strong
underbelly
of
illegal
aliens
glanz
said
about
lack
of
enforcement
at
other
departments
when
you
have
a
bunch
of
illegals
in
a
community
it
spawns
other
types
of
criminal
activity
it
helps
create
an
environment
where
that
criminality
can
exist
immigration
not
issue
in
all
areas
of
state
immigration
as
a
political
weapon
may
have
lost
its
edge
elsewhere
in
pottawatomie
county
for
instance
three
candidates
are
vying
for
sheriff
kurt
shireys
job
mike
booth
gary
roe
and
jay
davis
none
is
talking
about
immigration
immigration
has
not
been
a
big
issue
here
shirey
said
as
long
as
they
are
lawabiding
so
they
dont
draw
our
attention
shawnees
hispanic
population
is
officially
listed
at
about
19
percent
but
illegal
immigrants
are
largely
undercounted
in
those
statistics
the
citys
population
is
about
30000
the
issue
has
come
up
once
at
a
community
forum
shirey
said
its
just
like
i
told
that
person
at
the
forum
this
is
a
nation
of
immigrants
but
my
point
is
it
needs
to
be
done
legally
shirey
said
one
pottawatomie
county
resident
echoed
shireys
views
we
have
a
flurry
of
immigrants
around
here
they
come
and
they
go
said
debra

a
smallbusiness
owner
in
shawnee
i
will
make
my
decision
based
on
the
character
of
the
person
