the
us
government
has
begun
proceedings
to
deport
a
filipino
back
to
his
homeland
after
canadian
immigration
officers
refused
to
allow
him
to
enter
canada
last
week
to
make
a
refugee
claim
rodolfo
guerrero
pacificador
31
who
could
be
in
peril
if
he
is
sent
back
to
the
philippines
was
arrested
by
the
us
border
patrol
last
tuesday
after
crossing
the
rainbow
bridge
at
niagara
falls
ont
and
being
turned
back
he
was
charged
with
making
a
false
statement
and
illegally
entering
the
united
states
at
san

mr
pacificador
whose
father
was
a
politician
in
the
philippines
during
the
reign
of
former
president
ferdinand
marcos
crossed
over
to
the
canadian
side
with
a
cousin
robert
shapton
of
toronto
to
ask
for
refugee
status
canadian
immigration
officers
have
a
policy
whereby
they
must
first
obtain
assurances
from
their
us
counterparts
that
any
person
sent
back
to
the
us
side
will
be
allowed
to
return
for
an
immigration
inquiry
gerry
maffre
a
spokesman
for
the
department
of
immigration
said
yesterday
that
canadian
officials
received
that
assurance
before
returning
mr
pacificador
to
the
us
side
of
the
bridge
an
immigration
inquiry
date
was
set
for
tomorrow
but
it
is
not
yet
known
whether
mr
pacificador
will
be
allowed
to
keep
that
appointment
meanwhile
canadian
immigration
authorities
are
taking
a
wait
and
see
position
mr
maffre
said
canadian
immigration
officials
have
no
problem
over
how
the
incident
was
handled
because
we
have
received
assurances
that
mr
pacificador
will
be
available
for
his
inquiry
however
ben
ferro
a
spokesman
for
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
buffalo
ny
said
us
immigration
officials
have
not
given
any
assurances
to
their
canadian
counterparts
regarding
the
case
in
fact
mr
ferro
said
no
canadian
immigration
officer
had
got
in
touch
with
the
ins
before
sending
mr
pacificador
back
to
the
us
side
of
the
border
and
no
canadian
official
has
contacted
us
about
the
case
since
mr
ferro
also
said
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
case
specifically
precludes
returning
a
guy
like
this
apparently
mr
pacificador
is
wanted
in
the
philippines
as
an
accessory
to
murder
mendel
green
a
toronto
immigration
lawyer
who
is
acting
for
mr
pacificador
in
canada
said
the
charges
were
politically
motivated
trumped
up
its
not
uncommon
for
a
government
to
do
this
for
people
they
want
to
deal
with
in
a
special
way
mr
green
also
said
that
if
mr
pacificador
is
deported
to
his
homeland
he
will
be
sent
back
to
serious
peril
he
added
that
the
manner
in
which
canadian
immigration
officers
handled
the
case
is
a
serious
breach
of
the
understanding
that
the
minister
of
state
for
immigration
gerry
weiner
has
given
us
that
no
person
will
be
returned
to
the
us
until
assurances
are
received
that
he
will
be
permitted
to
return
to
canada
for
his
inquiry
mr
shapton
said
the
charges
against
mr
pacificador
relate
to
a
shootout
in
1984
in
which
several
people
were
killed
an
assassination
attempt
was
made
against
mr
pacificadors
father
arturo
a
member
of
the
philippine
congress
several
of
his
bodyguards
and
the
attackers
were
killed
some
relatives
of
the
dead
attackers
later
filed
charges
and
rodolfo
was
charged
with
being
an
accessory
to
murder
mr
shapton
said
mr
shapton
said
he
met
mr
pacificador
on
the
canadian
side
of
the
border
and
explained
the
case
to
immigration
officials
in
niagara
falls
he
was
interrogated
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
the
immigration
officers
gave
him
a
date
for
an
inquiry
i
was
quite
concerned
about
his
being
returned
to
the
states
but
we
were
assured
that
canada
had
this
agreement
with
the
united
states
and
everything
would
be
fine
mr
shapton
said
things
turned
for
the
worse
when
mr
pacificador
was
arrested
charged
and
put
in
jail
when
he
returned
to
the
us
side
of
the
border
mr
shapton
immediately
returned
to
the
canadian
side
and
an
immigration
officer
who
refused
to
give
his
name
only
his
badge
number
1518
refused
to
call
the
us
immigration
authorities
to
find
out
why
he
was
arrested
john
condon
a
buffalo
lawyer
representing
mr
pacificador
said
he
hopes
that
the
immigration
judge
will
allow
his
client
to
go
to
canada
mr
ferro
said
the
ins
would
have
no
objections
to
mr
pacificador
choosing
to
be
deported
to
a
third
country
such
as
canada
as
long
as
the
canadian
government
agreed
to
take
him
mr
maffre
said
immigration
canada
would
wait
to
see
if
mr
pacificador
is
allowed
to
come
to
canada
tomorrow
for
his
inquiry
before
deciding
what
further
action
might
be
taken
