senator
patrick
j
leahy
the
democrat
from
vermont
who
is
the
powerful
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
is
adding
another
controversial
ingredient
to
the
volatile
mix
of
an
immigration
debate
that
president
obama
has
said
he
hopes
to
spur
in
congress
before
the
end
of
the
year
mr
leahy
has
offered
a
bill
that
would
allow
american
citizens
and
legal
immigrants
to
seek
residency
in
the
united
states
for
their
samesex
partners
just
as
spouses
now
petition
for
foreignborn
husbands
and
wives
the
senator
has
said
the
bill
should
be
part
of
any
broad
immigration
legislation
that
congress
considers
to
highlight
his
initiative
known
as
the
uniting
american
families
act
mr
leahy
is
holding
a
hearing
on
wednesday
to
discuss
it
in
the
full
judiciary
committee
bypassing
the
usual
subcommittee
hearings
also
this
week
immigrant
advocacy
groups
and
labor
organizations
are
opening
a
nationwide
campaign
to
hold
president
obama
to
his
recent
pledge
to
initiate
a
congressional
debate
on
immigration
legislation
later
this
year
smallscale
rallies
took
place
on
monday
in
los
angeles
and
some
40
other
locations
and
immigration
groups
are
converging
on
washington
on
wednesday
for
three
days
of
strategy
meetings
the
obama
administration
juggling
an
array
of
huge
and
pressing
issues
on
the
economy
and
health
care
reform
has
encouraged
the
mobilization
of
immigration
advocates
especially
latino
groups
while
avoiding
any
legislative
battles
for
now
on
the
prickly
topic
of
immigration
president
obama
has
invited
a
bipartisan
group
of
lawmakers
to
the
white
house
next
monday
to
launch
a
policy
conversation
about
immigration
an
administration
official
said
the
president
wants
to
identify
areas
of
agreement
and
areas
where
we
still
have
work
to
do
said
the
official
who
would
only
speak
on
background
because
the
final
plans
for
the
meeting
were
not
settled
the
most
contentious
part
of
the
immigration
legislation
that
the
administration
supports
which
is
known
as
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
a
program
to
give
legal
status
to
more
than
11
million
illegal
immigrants
living
in
the
country
but
current
proposals
also
include
a
variety
of
measures
intended
like
senator
leahys
to
expand
or
streamline
the
legal
immigration
system
mr
leahys
proposal
for
samesex
immigration
benefits
was
not
included
in
the
immigration
legislation
that
the
bush
administration
brought
forward
in
2007
which
failed
after
a
firestorm
of
opposition
mainly
from
republican
voters
groups
backing
the
overhaul
this
year
have
cobbled
together
a
wideranging
but
fragile
coalition
that
includes
latino
and
black
groups
roman
catholic
and
evangelical
christian
churches
farm
workers
and
commercial
farmers
and
some
employer
groups
in
contrast
to
2007
organized
labor
is
united
this
time
around
in
supporting
the
overhaul
the
political
fault
lines
opened
by
senator
leahys
samesex
bill
quickly
became
apparent
this
week
in
a
letter
sent
tuesday
bishop
john
c
wester
of
salt
lake
city
the
chairman
of
the
catholic
bishops
committee
on
migration
wrote
that
the
uniting
american
families
act
would
erode
the
institution
of
marriage
and
family
by
taking
a
position
that
is
contrary
to
the
very
nature
of
marriage
which
predates
the
church
and
the
state
bishop
wester
addressed
his
letter
to
representative
michael
m
honda
a
california
democrat
who
has
said
he
will
introduce
an
immigration
bill
containing
similar
samesex
provisions
in
the
house
this
week
j
kevin
appleby
the
immigration
policy
director
for
the
bishops
conference
said
the
last
thing
the
national
immigration
debate
needs
is
another
politically
divisive
issue
added
to
the
mix
but
senator
leahy
said
the
bill
would
eliminate
discrimination
in
immigration
law
against
gay
and
lesbian
couples
under
family
unification
provisions
in
immigration
law
american
citizens
and
legal
residents
can
petition
for
residency
for
their
spouses
there
is
no
numerical
limit
on
permanent
residence
visas
known
as
green
cards
for
spouses
of
american
citizens
and
this
is
one
of
the
main
channels
for
legal
immigration
to
the
united
states
samesex
couples
though
cannot
petition
for
partners
and
many
face
the
prospect
of
an
immigrant
partners
deportation
senator
leahys
bill
would
add
the
term
permanent
partner
to
sections
of
current
immigration
law
that
refer
to
married
couples
and
would
provide
a
legal
definition
of
those
terms
i
just
think
its
a
matter
of
fairness
he
said
tuesday
in
an
interview
noting
that
a
number
of
american
allies
including
canada
france
and
germany
recognize
samesex
couples
in
immigration
law
the
judiciary
committee
is
to
hear
testimony
on
wednesday
from
shirley
tan
43
the
mother
of
twin
12yearold
boys
who
are
united
states
citizens
because
they
were
born
here
ms
tan
has
raised
them
with
her
partner
of
20
years
jay
mercado
who
like
ms
tan
is
from
the
philippines
although
ms
mercado
became
a
naturalized
american
citizen
in
1998
she
has
not
been
able
to
gain
legal
immigration
status
for
ms
tan
ms
tan
said
she
came
to
this
country
fleeing
a
cousin
who
was
released
from
prison
in
the
philippines
after
he
served
10
years
for
the
murders
of
her
mother
and
her
sister
ms
tan
said
she
had
been
severely
injured
in
the
1979
attack
by
the
cousin
she
applied
for
political
asylum
in
the
united
states
she
said
but
did
not
receive
notice
when
it
was
denied
years
later
she
remained
here
with
a
provisional
legal
status
until
last
jan
28
when
federal
immigration
agents
carrying
a
deportation
order
came
to
the
home
she
shares
with
ms
mercado
48
in
pacifica
calif
since
her
arrest
ms
tan
has
been
able
to
remain
legally
in
the
country
because
of
a
private
bill
introduced
on
her
behalf
by
senator
dianne
feinstein
democrat
of
california
ms
tan
said
she
feared
returning
to
live
in
the
philippines
in
part
because
of
concern
that
she
and
ms
mercado
would
face
antigay
discrimination
there
people
are
cruel
she
said
i
dont
know
if
i
can
expose
my
boys
to
narrowminded
people
opponents
of
the
leahy
bill
argue
that
it
would
foster
immigration
fraud
because
it
would
be
difficult
for
immigration
officers
to
determine
whether
samesex
couples
had
an
established
relationship
supporters
said
the
bill
would
assist
about
36000
samesex
couples
nationwide
rachel
b
tiven
the
executive
director
of
immigration
equality
a
group
that
advocates
for
gay
rights
legislation
said
the
bill
had
improved
chances
this
year
because
of
recent
samesex
marriage
victories
in
iowa
maine
and
vermont
