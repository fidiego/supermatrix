alabama
immigration
law
that
is
widely
considered
the
toughest
in
the
nation
is
being
challenged
in
court
by
the
obama
administration
which
contends
that
the
state
is
overstepping
its
authority
on
border
enforcement
to
put
it
in
terms
we
relate
to
here
in
alabama
you
can
only
have

a
federal
prosecutor
in
alabama
said
of
the
lawsuit
the
us
justice
department
brought
monday
august
1
according
to
the
birmingham
news
in
immigration
the
federal
government
is
the
quarterback
like
an
immigration
law
in
arizona
that
the
obama
administration
also
is
challenging
the
alabama
measure
allows
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
ask
about
the
immigration
status
of
those
they
stop
but
as
the
new
york
times
detailed
earlier
this
year
the
alabama
law
which
was
due
to
go
into
effect
next
month
goes
significantly
further
it
bars
illegal
immigrants
from
enrolling
in
any
public
college
after
high
school
the
paper
noted
it
obliges
public
schools
to
determine
the
immigration
status
of
all
students
requiring
parents
of
foreignborn
students
to
report
the
immigration
status
of
their
children
the
new
law
requires
alabamas
public
schools
to
publish
figures
on
the
number
of
immigrants
both
legal
and
illegal
who
are
enrolled
and
on
any
costs
associated
with
the
education
of
illegal
immigrant
children
the
measure
known
as
hb
56
also
makes
it
a
crime
to
knowingly
rent
housing
to
an
illegal
immigrant
it
bars
businesses
from
taking
tax
deductions
on
wages
paid
to
unauthorized
immigrants
in
challenging
alabamas
law
the
justice
department
said
it
cannot
allow
states
to
set
their
own
immigration
policies
particularly
when
those
policies
clash
with
federal
law
todays
action
makes
clear
that
setting
immigration
policy
and
enforcing
immigration
laws
is
a
national
responsibility
that
cannot
be
addressed
through
a
patchwork
of
state
immigration
laws
attorney
general
eric
holder
said
in
a
statement
the
department
is
committed
to
evaluating
each
state
immigration
law
and
making
decisions
based
on
the
facts
and
the
law
to
the
extent
we
find
state
laws
that
interfere
with
the
federal
governments
enforcement
of
immigration
law
we
are
prepared
to
bring
suit
as
we
did

arizona
