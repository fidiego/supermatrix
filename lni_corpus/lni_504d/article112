respond
to
the
needs
of
the
evergrowing
immigrant
community
in
reading
the
berks
county
bar
association
has
formed
an
immigration
law
committee
the
committee
chairman
is
attorney
eric
e
winter
of
prince
law
offices
bechtelsville
winter
is
like
many
of
the
lawyers
on
the
committee
in
that
immigration
law
is
just
one
part
of
his
practice
this
is
a
problem
in
the
county
according
to
donald
f
smith
jr
executive
director
of
the
berks
county
bar
association
while
more
than
half
of
the
population
in
reading
is
latino
no
law
practice
based
here
is
dedicated
to
immigration
work
he
said
what
immigration
specialists
there
are
are
attorneys
from
philadelphia
who
have
satellite
offices
in
reading
the
new
bar
committee
is
meant
to
help
educate
not
only
lawyers
but
also
the
community
on
immigration
law
the
community
is
largely
spanish
speaking
winter
saidand
because
they
might
be
illegal
they
are
very
mistrustful
the
bar
association
is
working
to
gain
the
immigrant
communitys
trust
to
prevent
situations
where
individuals
file
their
own
immigration
papers
or
are
taken
advantage
of
by
people
claiming
to
be
able
to
help
push
immigration
documents
through
the
system
because
they
some
immigrants
are
undocumented
they
are
afraid
to
come
forward
and
report
these
people
winter
said
i
have
seen
horrendous
things
they
may
not
be
submitting
the
appropriate
paperwork
it
may
not
be
filled
out
correctly
or
they
didnt
get
it
in
on
time
in
one
case
he
said
an
attorney
took
4000
to
help
a
man
gain
citizenship
then
did
nothing
when
an
immigrant
files
for
citizenship
or
a
green
card
extension
getting
the
correct
papers
in
on
time
makes
a
big
difference
winter
said
and
doing
things
correctly
can
also
be
a
challenge
because
immigration
law
is
not
static
there
is
a
major
change
in
immigration
law
nearly
every
two
years
he
said
for
instance
winter
said
an
appeals
court
recently
set
a
precedent
when
it
ruled
that
defense
lawyers
need
to
fully
inform
clients
who
are
not
citizens
how
a
guilty
plea
could
affect
their
immigration
status
we
want
to
make
sure
these
lawyers
reach
out
to
us
if
they
are
unsure
of
anything
winter
said
and
smith
said
the
committee
will
be
especially
helpful
for
lawyers
who
practice
immigration
law
i
think
this
committee
will
offer
an
exchange
of
ideas
for
those
lawyers
who
do
immigration
he
said
they
can
come
together
and
exchange
ideas
