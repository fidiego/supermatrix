few
of
the
nations
often
contentious
immigration
issues
were
clarified
in
the
aftermath
of
the
long
awaited
us
supreme
court
decision
in
arizona
v
united
states
the
decision
is
so
ambiguous
it
leaves
the
country
as
confused
as
it
was
before
rochester
immigration
attorney
stephen
m
brent
said
of
the
split
decision
announced
on
monday
its
clear
the
decision
reaffirms
how
completely
preeminent
federal
law
is
in
the
field
of
immigration
and
how
small
the
state
is
brent
said
of
the
decision
that
struck
down
most
of
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
but
left
intact
a
key
provision
that
allows
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
potentially
illegal
immigrants
as
long
as
they
arent
engaging
in
racial
profiling
as
walter
ruehle
director
of
the
immigration
program
at
the
legal
aid
society
of
rochester
and
an
adjunct
professor
of
law
at
cornell
law
school
explained
that
important
aspect
of
the
case
is
already
headed
to
a
federal
district
court
to
decide
state
and
local
police
will
routinely
call
immigration
ice
or
dhs
when
they
apprehend
a
person
who
is
undocumented
and
thats
ok
as
long
as
they
have
a
legitimate
basis
he
said
although
racial
profiling
wasnt
shown
to
be
the
case
in
arizonas
law
its
not
the
end
of
the
issue
as
far
as
the
supreme
court
goes
ruehle
said
another
cornell
professor
stephen
yaleloehr
said
by
upholding
that
portion
of
the
arizona
law
the
court
has
given
other
states
a
green
light
to
try
to
enact
similar
immigration
laws
regarding
immigrant
identification
ruehle
explained
its
clear
federal
law
does
not
prevent
arizona
from
enacting
a
statute
for
law
enforcement
to
communicate
with
immigration
authorities
regarding
someone
who
has
committed
a
crime
and
is
undocumented
but
yaleloehr
said
and
others
agreed
the
decision
increases
pressure
on
congress
to
enact
comprehensive
immigration
law
to
prevent
a
crazy
patchwork
of
conflicting
immigration
laws
around
the
country
the
message
they
gave
to
the
states
here
is
that
its
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
said
buffalo
immigration
attorney
matthew
kolken
we
werent
doing
anything
at
the
state
level
it
closes
the
door
to
other
states
waiting
in
the
wings
to
introduce
their
own
patchwork
legislation
kolken
said
as
a
result
of
the
decision
immigrants
in
new
york
could
be
caught
up
in
law
enforcement
targeting
persons
because
of
their
accent
or
the
color
of
their
skin
and
that
it
could
benefit
the
controversial
secure
communities
initiative
were
pleased
overall
with
the
ruling
other
than
the
provision
that
folks
can
still
be
stopped
pursuant
to
2b
arizona
law
checking
immigration
statuswed
rather
see
a
comprehensive
approach
to
fixing
the
nations
immigration
problems
not
piecemeal
type
legislation
where
every
state
handles
immigration
rights
differently
said
ruth
marchetti
justice
and
peace
coordinator
with
catholic
charities
of
wayne
county
marchetti
said
state
laws
that
prevent
helping
all
people
in
need
conflict
with
the
goal
of
catholic
charities
in
wayne
county
marchetti
explained
that
since
immigrant
farm
workers
here
and
around
the
country
follow
the
route
of
the
crops
the
legislative
action
individual
states
like
arizona
and
georgia
take
could
have
a
big
effect
if
they
were
allowed
to
stand
i
dont
think
either
party
is
interested
in
immigration
reform
but
the
reason
why
this
issue
came
up
now
is
because
there
is
an
election
in
november
and
everyone
wants
the
hispanic
vote
kolken
said
the
court
slapped
arizonas
wrist
in
this
decision
what
this
might
do
is
lead
to
further
dialogue
on
a
national
level
on
what
to
do
about
immigration
if
nothing
else
it
should
raise
the
importance
of
immigration
in
the
upcoming
presidential
election
