alabama
is
the
latest
state
to
adopt
legislation
to
enforce
state
laws
that
mirror
certain
federal
laws
that
washington
refuses
to
enforce
state
and
local
governments
have
a
compelling
interest
in
assisting
in
the
enforcement
of
laws
that
deter
illegal
immigration
the
failure
to
enforce
immigration
laws
imposes
enormous
fiscal
and
social
burdens
on
states
and
localities
where
illegal
aliens
settle
states
and
localities
must
provide
essential
services
such
as
education
and
emergency
health
care
to
illegal
aliens
and
cope
with
withering
criminal
justice
costs
they
must
also
deal
with
the
adverse
impact
of
illegal
immigration
on
workers
who
lose
jobs
and
become
dependent
on
state
services
congress
and
the
courts
have
repeatedly
recognized
state
and
local
governments
as
stakeholders
in
immigration
policy
and
has
encouraged
them
to
become
partners
in
immigration
enforcement
its
a
matter
of
basic
selfdetermination
under
the
best
of
circumstances
state
participation
is
indispensable
to
effective
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
in
light
of
the
obama
administrations
refusal
to
enforce
immigration
laws
evidenced
in
repeat
complaints
from
the
labor
union
representing
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
workers
that
they
are
being
hamstrung
by
administration
polices
state
laws
provide
the
only
meaningful
enforcement
there
is
empirical
and
anecdotal
evidence
that
state
enforcement
policies
work
in
arizona
and
georgia
where
such
policies
have
been
implemented
there
have
been
significant
and
immediate
declines
in
the
number
of
people
residing
illegally
these
successes
not
only
provide
a
model
for
other
states
that
wish
to
reduce
the
burdens
associated
with
illegal
immigration
theyre
also
an
effective
rebuttal
to
those
who
claim
that
mass
amnesty
is
the
only
way
to
solve
our
illegal
immigration
crisis
instead
of
fighting
states
that
implement
local
enforcement
strategies
the
executive
branch
should
be
emulating
those
strategies
consistent
national
policies
that
remove
the
incentives
for
illegal
immigration
would
encourage
millions
of
illegal
aliens
to
return
home
and
at
the
same
time
reassert
the
constitutional
balance
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
as
full
partners
in
federal
immigration
enforcement
