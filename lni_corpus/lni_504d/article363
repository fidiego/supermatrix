the
farreaching
immigration
law
that
took
effect
last
month
has
left
many
issues
festering
and
legislators
on
both
sides
of
the
political
divide
agree
that
renewed
debates
are
likely
when
congress
reconvenes
next
year
the
law
which
was
hailed
as
landmark
legislation
when
it
was
signed
by
president
clinton
in
september
dealt
with
the
relatively
soft
target
of
illegal
immigration
although
there
was
broad
agreement
on
the
need
to
curb
the
influx
of
illegal
aliens
controversies
over
how
to
go
about
it
nearly
derailed
the
bill
left
over
for
the
new
congress
is
the
much
thornier
question
of
what
to
do
about
legal
immigration
which
rose
sharply
in
1996
and
is
projected
to
keep
climbing
next
year
the
debate
over
legal
immigration
revolves
around
numbers
at
its
core
is
the
question
of
how
many
newcomers
should
be
let
into
the
country
but
while
there
seemed
to
be
bipartisan
support
for
reducing
legal
immigration
in
line
with
the
recommendations
of
an
independent
commission
last
year
efforts
to
legislate
such
cuts
ran
into
stiff
opposition
not
just
from
ethnic
and
immigrants
rights
lobbies
but
also
from
business
according
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
legal
immigration
increased
about
25
percent
during
fiscal
1996
from
the
previous
year
meaning
that
about
900000
people
entered
the
country
when
other
categories
of
newcomers
are
factored
in
such
as
asylum
seekers
and
parolees
granted
special
admission
the
total
approaches
1
million
the
surge
in
legal
immigration
is
attributed
in
large
part
to
a
decadeold
amnesty
law
that
legalized
26
million
illegal
aliens
many
of
whom
have
become
citizens
and
sought
permanent
resident
status
for
their
family
members
unlike
other
immigrant
categories
the
visa
allotment
for
immediate
relatives
of
us
citizens
has
no
numerical
limits
the
recent
influxes
have
raised
alarms
in
congress
over
the
longterm
impact
of
immigration
particularly
on
the
countrys
population
growth
lawmakers
concerned
about
the
high
levels
of
immigration
also
complain
about
the
more
immediate
social
costs
of
the
system
and
a
loss
of
control
over
who
is
allowed
to
immigrate
the
system
they
say
is
driven
less
by
americas
needs
than
by
chain
migration
in
which
successive
waves
of
immigrants
bring
in
their
relatives
immigration
imposes
a
burden
on
public
schools
and
health
services
these
restrictionists
argue
while
it
tends
to
depress
wages
in
certain
sectors
and
frustrates
efforts
to
move
americans
from
welfare
to
work
what
is
needed
now
they
assert
is
an
immigration
timeout
so
that
those
already
here
can
be
assimilated
on
the
other
side
of
the
debate
are
members
of
congress
from
both
parties
who
laud
the
historical
contributions
of
immigrants
to
american
life
and
who
worry
that
cuts
would
prevent
families
from
reunifying
and
deny
businesses
access
to
the
worlds
best
and
brightest
immigrants
have
helped
revitalize
innercity
neighborhoods
and
contributed
to
americas
hightech
edge
these
advocates
say
while
in
principle
some
may
favor
slight
reductions
it
has
proved
impossible
up
to
now
to
reach
consensus
on
where
to
make
cuts
every
proposal
to
reduce
or
eliminate
a
category
of
legal
immigrants
whether
familybased
or
employmentrelated
has
provoked
an
outcry
from
those
concerned
meanwhile
the
influx
seems
to
have
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
with
an
impact
far
beyond
the
numbers
usually
associated
with
legal
immigration
the
ins
estimates
for
example
that
americas
illegal
immigrant
population
about
46
million
is
increasing
by
about
300000
people
a
year
adding
them
to
the
total
of
about
1
million
immigrants
and
asylum
seekers
then
subtracting
the
estimated
200000
people
a
year
who
emigrate
leaves
a
net
annual
addition
of
about
11
million
people
from
all
forms
of
immigration
it
is
true
that
of
this
number
an
unknown
percentage
were
already
living
in
the
united
states
when
granted
legal
immigrant
status
on
the
other
hand
the
total
does
not
include
more
than
650000
people
a
year
who
are
admitted
for
periods
ranging
from
three
to
10
years
under
several
nonimmigrant
visa
categories
state
department
figures
show
many
of
these
nonimmigrants
end
up
staying
permanently
according
to
the
census
bureau
about
onethird
of
population
growth
in
the
united
states
stems
from
immigration
when
usborn
children
of
recent
immigrants
are
included
immigration
accounts
for
more
than
half
the
population
growth
the
bureau
says
the
surge
in
legal
immigration
in
recent
years
levels
are
double
what
they
were
two
decades
ago
has
contributed
to
a
sharp
revision
of
the
census
bureaus
projections
for
population
growth
in
the
next
century
in
1989
the
bureau
forecast
that
the
us
population
now
about
265
million
would
level
off
at
about
300
million
by
the
year
2050
but
in
1992
the
bureau
had
to
withdraw
that
projection
largely
because
of
trends
in
immigration
and
the
fertility
of
nonwhite
women
the
census
bureau
now
puts
the
us
population
in
2050
at
nearly
400
million
by
a
less
conservative
estimate
based
on
somewhat
higher
immigration
it
could
even
surpass
half
a
billion
the
bureau
says
about
93
percent
of
the
population
growth
in
the
year
2050
will
result
from
immigration
that
has
occurred
since
1991
the
bureau
estimates
citing
these
and
other
census
statistics
in
a
house
speech
earlier
this
year
rep
anthony
c
beilenson
dcalif
warned
that
far
from
leveling
off
the
us
population
will
continue
to
grow
unabated
into
the
late
21st
century
more
immediately
the
new
congress
is
expected
to
have
its
hands
full
with
what
some
legislators
say
is
the
unfinished
business
of
immigration
reform
sen
edward
m
kennedy
dmass
wants
to
restrict
the
ability
of
employers
to
use
temporary
foreign
workers
to
replace
americans
critics
of
jobrelated
immigration
say
employers
often
use
it
to
cut
salary
and
benefit
costs
and
that
the
influx
of
temporary
workers
tends
eventually
to
drive
jobs
overseas
and
erode
the
us
tax
base
kennedy
a
senior
member
of
the
senate
committee
that
deals
with
immigration
says
he
favors
a
modest
reduction
in
legal
immigration
but
indicates
he
is
most
interested
in
obtaining
additional
labor
department
inspectors
and
cracking
down
on
employers
who
hire
illegal
workers
the
key
question
next
year
is
whether
we
protect
american
workers
or
coddle
the
unscrupulous
employers
kennedy
said
other
democrats
want
to
roll
back
provisions
of
the
new
welfare
and
immigration
laws
that
restrict
benefits
to
legal
immigrants
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
people
seeking
political
asylum
to
enter
the
country
republicans
meanwhile
may
try
again
to
give
states
the
option
of
denying
free
public
education
to
illegal
immigrant
children
and
end
automatic
birthright
citizenship
for
children
born
in
the
united
states
to
illegal
immigrant
parents
both
highly
controversial
issues
and
sources
of
division
within
the
gop
the
naturalization
of
record
numbers
of
immigrants
which
has
been
under
investigation
by
a
house
subcommittee
appears
likely
to
continue
drawing
fire
in
the
republicancontrolled
congress
especially
because
new
citizens
may
have
tipped
the
balance
in
favor
of
a
democrat

at
least
