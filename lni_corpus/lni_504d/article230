ann
kim
made
monthly
trips
this
year
to
a
richmond
area
immigrant
detention
center
trying
to
free
a
mentally
ill
honduran
man
he
ended
up
being
deported
but
kim
got
something
out
of
it
more
experience
in
the
burgeoning
field
of
immigration
law
immigration
is
becoming
more
and
more
complex
and
its
going
against
immigrants
rather
than
for
them
said
kim
27
a
secondgeneration
korean
american
who
took
the
hondurans
case
as
part
of
her
immigration
law
clinic
at
american
universitys
washington
college
of
law
theres
a
great
need
for
lawyers
a
subject
that
three
decades
ago
was
a
secondary
technical
field
delegated
to
adjunct
professors
is
booming
at
law
schools
nationwide
elective
immigration
law
courses
taught
by
tenured
specialists
are
filling
lecture
halls
immigration
clinics
are
expanding
and
student
groups
devoted
to
the
subject
are
mushrooming
the
momentum
is
partly
driven
by
a
highprofile
rancorous
immigration
debate
but
it
is
also
the
result
of
an
era
of
mass
immigration
that
has
fueled
demand
from
foreigners
and
businesses
seeking
help
navigating
us
immigration
statutes
and
has
created
a
generation
of
law
students
intimately
familiar
with
the
issue
often
because
they
are
children
of
immigrants
or
immigrants
themselves
immigration
is
just
one
part
of
a
much
broader
story
about
globalization
of
movement
of
goods
and
movement
of
people
and
movement
of
ideas
and
what
used
to
be
a
backwater
of
the
law
has
become
mainstream
said
t
alexander
aleinikoff
dean
of
georgetown
university
law
school
who
coauthored
the
first
major
immigration
law
casebook
in
1985
this
is
certainly
a
very
very
hot
topic
unlike
undergraduates
law
students
do
not
pick
majors
so
there
are
no
statistics
on
the
number
studying
immigration
law
but
professors
say
there
is
no
question
about
the
explosion
in
interest
when
au
created
an
immigration
division
within
its
wellknown
human
rights
clinic
three
years
ago
administrators
struggled
to
fill
it
now
as
many
as
32
students
vie
each
year
for
16
slots
we
have
to
beat
them
away
with
a
stick
said
richard
wilson
a
professor
two
years
ago
the
school
added
two
more
sections
of
a
basic
immigration
law
course
at
least
50
law
schools
offer
immigration
clinics
which
usually
give
students
the
chance
to
represent
indigent
immigrants
who
have
no
right
to
courtappointed
lawyers
more
sprout
each
year
this
year
clinics
have
been
launched
at
the
university
of
la
verne
and
southwestern
law
school
in
southern
california
as
well
as
at
schools
in
areas
that
have
seen
recent
influxes
in
immigration
such
as
penn
state
and
the
university
of
arkansas
where
students
circulated
a
petition
in
support
of
the
idea
student
teams
can
debate
the
finer
points
of
the
immigration
code
each
year
at
the
nations
first
moot
court
competition
begun
by
new
york
university
two
years
ago
the
university
of
california
at
davis
started
a
second
contest
this
year
in
the
past
three
years
students
at
the
university
of
maryland
george
mason
university
and
harvard
university
have
founded
immigration
law
groups
at
au
an
immigrants
rights
coalition
formed
by
law
students
in
2005
has
50
members
and
has
hosted
a
conference
on
a
new
visa
category
and
panels
of
day
laborers
and
refugees
were
a
country
of
immigrants
and
yet
were
putting
immigrants
out
said
the
groups
cochairman
amalia
greenberg
29
who
emigrated
from
venezuela
at
age
6
its
a
continuation
of
the
civil
rights
movement
and
it
feels
like
its
in
our
hands
to
do
something
about
it
professors
say
the
immigration
law
boom
is
part
of
a
broader
explosion
of
interest
in
human
rights
and
international
law
spurred
by
todays
globally
minded
students
immigration
is
by
no
means
the
hottest
law
school
topic
criminal
law
and
litigation
remain
hugely
popular
and
environmental
law
is
a
new
favorite
and
although
practitioners
ranks
are
growing
membership
in
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
has
nearly
doubled
since
2003
to
more
than
11000
15
percent
of
whom
passed
the
bar
exam
within
the
past
three
years
the
majority
of
students
in
immigration
law
classes
will
not
become
immigration
lawyers
professors
said
many
students
said
they
might
specialize
in
another
area
and
do
pro
bono
immigration
cases
on
the
side
but
there
is
a
growing
realization
students
and
professors
said
that
policies
on
issues
such
as
asylum
and
due
process
are
evolving
as
never
before
particularly
since
the
sept
11
2001
terrorist
attacks
a
growing
immigrant
population
also
means
that
legal
status
often
complicates
what
might
have
once
been
simple
criminal
or
labor
cases
its
not
just
that
people
think
immigration
is
important
but
theyre
seeing
that
it
affects
everything
said
hiroshi
motomura
an
immigration
law
professor
who
will
join
ucla
in
the
fall
many
students
said
their
studies
had
underscored
how
thorny
immigration
is
jennifer
khouri
recently
graduated
from
george
washington
university
law
school
as
a
student
she
successfully
argued
at
arlington
immigration
court
that
an
illegal
immigrant
from
colombia
should
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
united
states
with
her
young
son
a
us
citizen
as
proud
as
khouri
is
of
that
victory
she
is
starting
a
job
this
fall
as
a
us
department
of
justice
attorney
representing
the
government
in
immigration
court
on
both
sides
the
reaction
is
too
emotional
theres
not
enough
actually
looking
at
the
numbers
empirical
evidence
about
how
immigrants
are
affecting
the
country
said
khouri
27
the
daughter
of
a
lebanese
immigrant
father
and
cuban
immigrant
mother
the
reason
i
want
to
work
for
the
government
is
because
i
want
to
push
for
the
middle
the
topics
ultrapolitical
nature
frustrates
some
asha
allam
who
recently
took
gws
immigration
clinic
said
the
experience
made
her
decide
against
the
field
because
she
thought
the
immigration
system
was
unfair
in
part
because
of
documented
disparities
of
approval
and
denial
rates
among
immigration
judges
stalled
federal
immigration
legislation
also
means
lawyers
can
offer
little
aid
to
illegal
immigrants
she
said
lawyers
are
telling
a
lot
of
their
clients
theres
nothing
we
can
do
for
you
right
now
said
allam
23
who
plans
to
work
in
global
trade
in
hopes
that
someday
people
will
not
have
to
migrate
for
opportunities
thats
not
really
legal
advice
she
said
the
challenges
have
only
energized
karlie
dunsky
a
gw
law
student
unlike
many
of
her
peers
she
had
little
experience
with
immigrants
while
growing
up
in
ohio
but
shes
set
on
a
career
in
refugee
and
asylum
law
im
going
to
have
to
get
used
to
my
clients
claims
being
denied
but
the
first
one
is
always
hard
said
dunsky
24
but
she
said
what
makes
immigration
so
compelling
is
that
its
a
human
issue
its
not
some
vague
entity
that
doesnt
have
a
face
it
really
motivates
you
