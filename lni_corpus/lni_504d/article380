the
nature
and
size
of
the
stream
of
newcomers
propel
the
expanding
debate
over
immigration
but
domestic
changes
lend
much
of
the
edge
economics
surging
immigration
has
coincided
with
economic
stagnation
layoffs
and
pessimism
for
the
first
time
americans
doubt
their
children
will
do
as
well
as
they
did
polls
show
many
worry
about
job
competition
from
immigrants
or
their
impact
on
budget
deficits
past
business
slowdowns
led
to
immigration
pauses
but
the
current
flow
has
continued
unabated
in
part
because
it
is
less
tied
to
the
domestic
economy
or
job
skills
and
more
driven
by
personal
considerations
such
as
family
reunification
or
political
persecution
the
2
million
illegal
aliens
in
california
make
up
half
the
nations
undocumented
they
fill
hospital
emergency
rooms
and
classrooms
feeding
concerns
over
public
spending
politics
large
influxes
have
made
immigration
a
consuming
political
issue
in
coastal
or
border
states
like
california
florida
and
texas
domestic
population
shifts
southward
and
westward
have
given
those
three
states
more
than
half
the
electoral
votes
needed
to
win
the
presidency
elevating
their
concerns
to
the
national
level
external
politics
also
plays
a
role
during
the
cold
war
those
who
sought
to
come
here
generally
could
count
on
public
support
because
they
demonstrated
the
appeal
of
the
american
system
that
prod
now
is
gone
in
an
ironic
turn
of
events
some
even
suggest
the
search
for
a
menace
to
replace
soviet
communism
has
settled
on
immigrants
competence
anxiety
over
immigration
appears
in
part
related
to
a
dip
in
public
confidence
in
government
sparked
by
such
problems
as
poorly
protected
borders
given
its
history
the
united
states
should
set
policy
standards
for
the
world
says
former
st
louis
county
executive
gene
mcnary
who
ran
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
the
bush
administration
but
people
look
at
us
and
say
our
own
immigration
policy
is
out
of
control
some
critics
assert
that
even
legal
immigration
reflects
policy
run
amok
former
sen
eugene
mccarthy
says
he
cosponsored
the
1965
law
to
eliminate
bias
after
assurances
from
the
bills
architects
that
the
overall
volume
and
jobbased
nature
of
immigration
would
not
change
they
were
wrong
mccarthy
says
because
they
didnt
consider
the
family
dynamics
in
the
bill
or
the
hopes
it
would
raise
the
result
is
that
exploding
population
and
despair
in
poor
countries
have
been
allowed
to
wrest
control
of
us
immigration
policy
philosophy
diversity
is
what
america
is
all
about
say
immigration
advocates
noting
how
often
in
the
past
critics
looked
back
fondly
on
earlier
waves
but
with
intolerance
on
current
ones
its
a
new
playing
field
respond
antagonists
multiculturalism
means
newcomers
are
less
expected
to
adapt
to
american
values
and
culture
affirmative
action
means
immigration
expands
protected
groups
at
the
expense
of
longtime
residents
the
rise
of
a
welfare
state
means
immigrants
stay
whether
they
succeed
or
not
an
intriguing
split
has
developed
on
the
right
freemarket
conservatives
like
jack
kemp
and
william
bennett
maintain
that
immigrants
embody
endangered
american
values
of
initiative
hard
work
family
religion
community
cultural
conservatives
such
as
pat
buchanan
contend
they
threaten
national
unity
by
bringing
divergent
perspectives
to
a
land
less
and
less
willing
to
deem
its
own
values
superior
liberals
are
seeing
their
own
rift
with
some
saying
that
antiimmigrant
sentiment
stems
from
racism
while
foes
counter
that
in
practice
the
newly
diverse
population
will
compete
with
blacks
and
draw
attention
from
the
injustices
they
still
face
