when
the
freighter
golden
venture
ran
aground
off
queens
last
weekend
it
sparked
the
latest
crisis
to
confront
an
immigration
agency
that
has
lurched
from
controversy
to
controversy
without
a
leader
since
president
clinton
took
office
at
a
most
sensitive
time
in
immigration
history
mr
clinton
has
not
yet
nominated
an
immigration
and
naturalization
service
commissioner
or
publicly
articulated
an
immigration
policy
distinct
from
his
republican
predecessor
as
most
senior
immigration
jobs
are
empty
the
agency
is
being
run
by
holdovers
from
the
bush
administration
in
washington
and
into
the
vacuum
local
ins
directors
career
officials
like
william
s
slattery
in
new
york
have
moved
to
reassert
their
power
and
lawenforcement
priorities
to
be
fair
few
recent
presidents
have
rushed
to
fill
the
top
ins
job
upon
assuming
office
but
the
immigration
issue
carries
a
distinct
urgency
now
from
the
outset
of
his
presidency
when
mr
clinton
risked
having
his
inaugural
celebration
disturbed
by
an
exodus
of
haitian
boat
people
one
major

after
another

extremely

its
an
extremely
fragile
moment
for
the
agency
to
be
rudderless
said
warren
leiden
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
in
washington
some
of
our
most
shameful
exclusionary
immigration
laws
have
been
passed
at
moments
just
like
this
when
the
country
was
suffering
an
economic
downturn
and
foreigners
were
focused
on
as
a
threat
while
the
white
house
has
remained
silent
many
immigration
experts
expect
that
mr
clinton
will
nominate
doris
m
meissner
as
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
they
believe
that
the
nomination
is
imminent
ms
meissner
an
immigration
expert
at
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
was
the
acting
commissioner
and
an
associate
executive
commissioner
of
the
ins
under
president
reagan
wellversed
in
immigration
law
and
the
arcane
inner
workings
of
the
agency
ms
meissner
is
a
safe
choice
both
an
insider
and
a
knowledgeable
expert
fellow
immigration
specialists
believe
she
will
probably
focus
first
on
the
management
problems
plaguing
the
agencys
notoriously
inefficient
bureaucracy
during
this
interim
period
however
without
a
central
office
to
rein
them
in
local
immigration
directors
have
attempted
to
recapture
some
of
the
ground
they
lost
under
gene
mcnary
the
commissioner
under
president
bush
mr
mcnary
had
tried
to
curb
the
discretionary
power
of
the
local
offices
which
historically
made
the
agency
a
kingdom
of
barons
without
any
monarch
local
directors
felt
that
mr
mcnary
did
not
give
a
high
enough
priority
to
enforcement
and
paid
too
much
attention
to
the
agencys
human
rights
responsibilities
like
running
the
political
asylum
system
after
the
world
trade
center
bombing
and
again
after
the
grounding
of
the
golden
venture
mr
slattery
seized
the
moment
to
make
public
appearances
railing
against
the
humanitarian
leniencies
of
the
asylum
system
while
advocates
for
immigrants
have
long
criticized
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
for
its
backlogged
system
mr
slattery
and
other
officials
turned
the
tables
blaming
the
supposedly
crafty
immigrants
who
stormed
the
gates
grabbing
the
initiative
immigration
lawyers
in
new
york
said
it
was
unclear
whether
mr
slattery
had
been
instructed
to
make
an
example
of
the
illegal
chinese
immigrants
from
the
grounded
freighter
or
whether
he
had
grabbed
the
initiative
to
get
tough
himself
by
keeping
them
in
detention
centers
slattery
cannot
not
conceive
of
an
alien
who
has
a
legitimate
claim
of
persecution
and
he
has
been
much
admired
during
this
interregnum
by
other
career
bureaucrats
for
reasserting
the
oldtimers
cynicism
about
political
asylum
said
arthur
helton
an
immigration
expert
for
the
lawyers
committee
for
international
human
rights
rosemary
laguardia
a
spokeswoman
for
mr
slattery
said
he
was
traveling
and
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
as
local
immigration
officials
have
tried
to
reassert
their
autonomy
they
have
received
mixed
signals
from
the
clinton
administration
about
whether
big
change
was
really
on
the
horizon
immoral
repatriation
during
the
presidential
campaign
mr
clinton
criticized
the
bush
administrations
immoral
repatriation
of
haitian
boat
people
yet
as
president
he
embraced
the
same
policy
similarly
mr
clinton
not
only
kept
open
the
barbedwire
detention
camp
for
haitian
refugees
at
the
guantanamo
naval
base
he
also
continued
the
bush
administrations
legal
fight
against
closing
it
until
a
federal
judge
ordered
the
camp
shut
down
last
week
its
confusing
to
the
country
that
the
clinton
administration
now
has
a
headless
immigration
agency
which
is
continuing
the
discredited
practices
of
bush
said
lucas
guttentag
who
heads
the
immigration
project
at
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
from
the
opposite
camp
george
high
essentially
agreed
its
very
hard
to
know
where
this
administration
really
stands
on
an
issue
immigration
that
will
have
an
enormous
impact
on
this
country
said
mr
high
the
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
favors
restrictions
on
immigration
