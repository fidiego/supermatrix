it
may
be
possible
to
sing
the

song
outlined
in

steins
letter
largescale
immigration
also
hurts

it
is
unacceptable
to
do
it
with
harry
trumans
words
mr
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
quotes
president
truman
out
of
context
and
argues
for
some
of
the
same
restrictionist
views
that
truman
opposed
and
that
prompted
him
to
veto
the
1952
mccarranwalter
immigration
bill
mr
stein
quotes
from
trumans
veto
message
in
no
other
realm
of
our
national
life
are
we
so
hampered
and
stultified
by
the
dead
hand
of
the
past
as
we
are
in
this
field
of
immigration
and
he
ends
there
but
heres
the
rest
of
the
paragraph
we
do
not
limit
our
cities
to
their
1920
boundaries
we
do
not
hold
our
corporations
to
their
1920
capitalizations
we
welcome
progress
and
change
to
meet
changing
conditions
in
every
sphere
of
life
except
in
the
field
of
immigration
mr
steins
arguments
are
the
economic
equivalent
of
the
antiimmigration
arguments
of
the
1952
law
that
truman
objected
to
because
it
carried
forward
the
racist
arguments
of
the
1920s
mr
stein
may
disagree
with
truman
but
he
shouldnt
distort
what
the
president
said
or
what
he
believed
which
was
in
favor
of
a
progressive
and
generous
immigration
policy
