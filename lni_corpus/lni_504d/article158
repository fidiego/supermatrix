attempt
is
afoot
to
fix
an
ineffective
federal
immigration
law
with
a
state
law
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigrants
this
time
in
virginia
prince
william
county
supervisors
chairman
corey
stewart
is
trying
to
drum
up
grassroots
support
for
his
proposal
the
socalled
virginia
rule
of
law
act
in
hopes
of
getting
a
lawmaker
to
file
it
in
the
general
assembly
next
year
he
may
well
succeed
the
local
delegate
republican
scott
lingamfelter
has
said
hes
sent
the
proposal
to
virginias
division
of
legislative
services
for
analysis
and
other
lawmakers
say
they
are
working
on
immigration
bills
for
the
2011
session
lost
in
the
populist
frenzy
is
the
fact
that
virginia
already
has
some
of
the
toughest
state
immigration
laws
in
the
nation
stewarts
proposal
includes
some
provisions
already
on
the
books
for
example
state
law
requires
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
arrested
and
jailed
this
week
attorney
general
ken
cuccinelli
expanded
that
authority
by
issuing
an
opinion
that
the
law
allows
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
stop
for
any
reason
the
place
to
pursue
more
effective
action
is
in
congress
where
rational
immigration
reform
would
relieve
pressure
on
states
to
pass
harsh
constitutionally
questionable
laws
while
states
can
and
do
enact
immigration
laws
piecemeal
efforts
to
overhaul
federal
policy
will
run
headon
into
both
practical
and
constitutional
roadblocks
a
us
district
court
judges
temporary
injunction
last
week
blocked
the
most
contentious
provisions
of
arizonas
immigration
law
cuccinellis
aggressive
interpretation
of
virginia
law
invites
similar
court
challenges
arizonas
governor
promises
to
fight
for
her
states
suspect
new
law
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court
if
necessary
while
no
one
can
say
with
certainty
how
the
current
court
would
rule
the
federal
government
does
seem
to
have
precedent
on
its
side
in
protecting
civil
liberties
and
congressional
authority
cuccinelli
had
joined
with
attorneys
general
from
eight
other
states
in
filing
friend
of
the
court
briefs
in
support
of
arizonas
law
he
dismissed
the
impact
of
the
preliminary
injunction
blocking
what
he
called
arizonas
efforts
to
protect
its
residents
he
misses
the
courts
logic
a
law
forcing
perhaps
even
as
in
virginia
simply
allowing
state
and
local
police
to
try
to
verify
the
legal
status
of
everyone
they
stop
whom
they
suspect
might
be
illegal
would
divert
resources
from
the
federal
governments
other
responsibilities
and
priorities
like
going
after
the
truly
bad
guys
toughonimmigrants
plays
well
politically
but
it
invites
unintended
consequences
that
would
not
protect
the
safety
of
lawabiding
residents
