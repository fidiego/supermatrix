a
federal
judge
has
given
opponents
of
arizonas
sweeping
antiillegal
immigration
law
access
to
emails
letters
and
memos
between
supporters
of
sb
1070
and
legislators
to
see
whether
there
are
racial
overtones
in
the
messages
in
december
us
district
judge
susan
bolton
in
phoenix
rejected
arguments
made
by
two
of
the
laws
supporters
who
maintained
that
communications
sent
to
lawmakers
who
created
and
supported
sb
1070
were
confidential
challengers
to
sb
1070
called
boltons
ruling
a
victory
because
their
lawsuit
was
based
partly
on
allegations
that
legislators
meant
to
discriminate
against
latinos
and
other
people
of
color
if
so
the
challengers
argue
the
law
could
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
us
constitution
this
is
just
the
latest
twist
in
an
ongoing
dispute
on
the
surviving
and
most
divisive
provision
of
arizonas
immigration
enforcement
law
considered
the
toughest
state
law
against
illegal
immigration
in
the
country
both
inside
and
outside
arizona
the
measure
generated
scorn
as
well
as
praise
with
some
states
using
it
as
a
model
for
their
own
immigration
laws
boltons
ruling
covers
more
than
just
the
communications
about
sb
1070
challengers
also
want
to
see
emails
letters
and
memos
related
to
the
creation
of
earlier
immigration
measures
she
did
not
set
a
deadline
for
turning
over
the
emails
in
late
december
the
attorneys
for
two
antiillegalimmigration
groups
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
and
the
immigration
reform
law
institute
filed
a
motion
for
the
decisions
reconsideration
which
will
probably
bring
the
issue
back
before
the
same
judge
the
judges
order
applies
to
emails
from
the
two
groups
to
legislators
as
well
as
replies
dan
stein
president
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
and
chairman
of
the
board
at
the
immigration
reform
law
institute
criticized
the
decision
calling
it
an
invidious
fishing
expedition
its
broad
and
vastly
intrusive
and
interferes
with
our
1st
amendment
liberties
to
interact
with
public
officials
stein
said
bolton
rejected
such
arguments
in
the
dec
11
ruling
she
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
law
that
protects
from
public
view
communications
with
public
officials
in
their
official
capacity
about
a
matter
of
public
concern
indeed
arizona
law
makes
all
such
communications
available
to
the
public
under
its
freedom
of
information
law
sb
1070
which
gov
jan
brewer
signed
into
law
in
2010
contained
several
measures
intended
to
give
local
law
enforcement
more
power
to
detain
people
who
were
in
the
country
illegally
in
2012
the
us
supreme
court
struck
down
key
provisions
of
sb
1070
but
allowed
the
most
controversial
portion
to
take
effect
arizona
can
compel
law
enforcement
officials
to
check
the
status
of
someone
they
stop
for
lawful
reasons
if
they
suspect
the
person
is
in
the
country
illegally
immigrant
rights
activists
filed
suit
and
have
been
battling
in
court
to
have
the
provision
blocked
claiming
the
legislature
intended
to
discriminate
against
latinos
and
other
minorities
victor
viramontes
senior
legal
counsel
with
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
said
the
laws
opponents
subpoenaed
communications
that
specifically
mention
certain
words
including
day
laborer
alien
hispanic
mexican
and
wetback
well
be
looking
for
any
kind
of
explicit
derogatory
depictions
of
latinos
viramontes
said
anything
with
racial
overtones
with
regards
to
latinos
or
mexicans
and
any
kind
of
communication
that
suggests
the
true
reason
this
law
was
passed
to
target
and
discriminate
against
latinos
