the

sen
phil
gramm
rtexas
said
before
the
senate
voted
8020
to
defeat
an
amendment
to
trim
legal
immigration
by
10
percent
for
the
next
five
years
two
attempts
failed
the
measure
sponsored
by
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
would
have
made
it
far
more
difficult
for
the
adult
children
and
siblings
of
us
citizens
to
immigrate
simpson
tried
to
attach
the
legalimmigration
restrictions
to
a
bill
that
would
sharply
reduce
illegal
immigration
a
separate
attempt
by
democratic
sen
dianne
feinstein
of
california
to
cap
legal
immigration
by
family
members
of
citizens
and
permanent
legal
residents
at
existing
levels
was
turned
aside
by
a
7426
vote
immigration
advocates
cheered
thursdays
action
saying
the
lopsided
votes
effectively
kill
a
17month
drive
to
deeply
reduce
legal
immigration
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
70
years
the
house
last
month
also
balked
at
making
legalimmigration
reductions
part
of
a
bill
aimed
at
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigrants
this
congress
wants
to
preserve
our
tradition
as
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
this
says
deep
cuts
in
legal
immigration
are
unacceptable
to
both
parties
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
pro
immigration
group
sharry
said
simpson
blundered
by
seeking
to
make
legalimmigration
cuts
part
of
the
popular
illegalimmigration
bill
instead
of
waiting
to
debate
each
issue
separately
a
separate
bill
targeting
legal
immigration
is
pending
but
the
senates
action
reduces
the
likelihood
that
congress
will
pass
legislation
addressing
legal
immigration
this
year
simpson
chairman
of
the
senate
immigration
subcommittee
called
his
legal
immigration
cuts
modest
and
even
more
justified
because
of
new
figures
that
show
legal
immigration
to
the
united
states
is
expected
to
jump
41
percent
this
year
these
latest
projections
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
show
a
dramatic
spike
in
legal
immigration
after
a
104
percent
decline
in
lawful
immigration
last
year
much
of
the
boom
reflects
delayed
paperwork
changing
the
status
of
people
now
in
the
country
illegally
rather
than
a
flood
of
immigrants
from
outside
senators
noted
some
republican
lawmakers
charged
the
ins
with
deliberately
delaying
the
release
of
those
figures
until
support
for
legal
immigration
cuts
sputtered
in
congress
truth
is
alien
to
this
administration
when
it
comes
to
immigration
reform
said
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
simpson
said
that
about
75
percent
of
americans
want
curbs
on
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
he
said
failure
to
do
that
will
contribute
even
more
to
the
general
cynicism
about
congress
predicts
rising
anger
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
favors
strict
cuts
said
the
senate
placed
the
desires
of
most
americans
below
the
wishes
of
labor
business
and
hightech
groups
to
bring
in
foreign
workers
i
think
were
seeing
the
failure
of
political
leadership
on
this
issue
while
the
country
gets
madder
and
madder
stein
said
but
many
senators
telling
stories
about
ancestors
harrowing
oceancrossing
trips
to
reach
the
united
states
said
legalimmigration
cuts
are
foolhardy
some
argued
that
simpsons
measure
wrongly
would
allow
spouses
and
minor
children
of
permanentresident
entrants
to
enter
the
country
legally
while
excluding
the
adult
children
and
siblings
of
us
