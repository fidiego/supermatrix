new
immigrants
suffer
higher
unemployment
rates
and
lower
wages
than
canadianborn
residents
say
two
recent
studies
which
like
magnets
attracted
controversy
but
maybe
not
for
all
the
right
reasons
the
university
of
toronto
and
simon
fraser
university
surveys
suggest
as
commentators
have
said
that
employers
might
discriminate
against
new
immigrants
because
their
skin
is
not
white
but
the
surveys
also
reinforce
anxiety
that
canada
has
welcomed
too
many
immigrants
their
findings
back
up
arguments
that
canada
has
excessive
numbers
pursuing
too
few
jobs
and
driving
down
wages
especially
of
those
with
low
skills
the
federal
government
may
be
guilty
of
both
feeding
immigrants
falsely
high
expectations
and
shortchanging
nativeborn
canadians
immigration
issues
divide
people
and
prove
ethically
complex
while
compassionate
liberals
lean
toward
openborder
policies
to
give
a
chance
to
struggling
people
in
struggling
countries
the
20thcentury
philosopher
john
rawls
says
a
nation
cant
be
expected
to
improve
the
lot
of
everyone
in
the
world
nations
can
maintain
a
just
welfare
society
only
with
tight
borders
canada
is
one
of
just
six
countries
in
the
world
including
the
us
britain
australia
new
zealand
and
israel
that
officially
welcomes
immigrants
says
university

demographer

immigration
levels
he
says
are
the
highest
per

in
the
world
north
american
economists
who
have
so
far
won
governments
ear
support
high
immigration
they
claim
immigrants
improve
a
countrys
overall
economy
but
other
economists
say
what
is
more
painfully
clear
is
immigration
creates
economic
winners
and
losers
in
novembers
atlantic
monthly
george
borjas
professor
of
public
policy
at
harvards
john
f
kennedy
school
of
government
wrote
that
affluent
americans
tend
to
gain
from
high
immigration
while
poor
americans
generally
suffer
the
debate
over
immigration
policy
is
not
over
whether
the
entire
country
is
made
better
off
by
immigration
it
is
over
how
the
economic
pie
is
sliced
up
borjas
says
current
immigration
redistributes
wealth
from
unskilled
workers
whose
wages
are
lowered
by
immigrants
to
skilled
workers
and
owners
of
companies
that
buy
immigrants
services
in
canada
says
simon
fraser
university
immigration
specialist
don
devoretz
studies
show
that
workers
in
47
major
canadian
industries
are
losing
jobs
or
getting
lower
wages
because
of
immigration
borjas
says
immigration
policy
is
a
tugofwar
between
those
who
gain
from
immigration
and
those
who
lose
so
far
borjas
maintains
the
winners
particularly
employers
who
gain
lowerwage
workers
and
more
consumers
have
been
indifferent
to
the
problems
of
the
losers
borjass
analysis
helps
explain
why
north
american
business
leaders
and
governments
seem
so
out
of
sync
with
the
public
on
immigration
a
recent
mcintyre
and
mustel
poll
reveals
60
per
cent
of
british
columbians
think
immigration
levels
are
too
high
their
reasons
are
not
necessarily
racist
women
are
becoming
more
likely
than
men
to
dislike
high
immigration
for
pragmatic
reasons
pollsters
say
greater
vancouver
women
are
more
in
touch
with
how
high
immigration
is
making
it
harder
for
their
offspring
to
get
strong
educations
entrylevel
jobs
and
affordable
housing
in
boom
bust
and
echo
foot
says
the
last
thing
canada
should
have
done
during
the
recession
that
struck
most
of
canada
in
the
early
1990s
was
allow
in
record
numbers
of
immigrants
more
than
210000
per
year
with
canadas
babyboomers
already
in
the
labor
force
depressing
wages
the
country
didnt
need
more
immigrants
to
further
push
down
salaries
foot
says
even
at
half
its
current
level
of
immigration
foot
says
canadas
birth
rate
is
robust
enough
to
keep
the
countrys
population
growing
until
the
middle
of
the
21st
century
and
anyway
foot
says
theres
nothing
wrong
with
populations
that
arent
vigorously
swelling
many
european
countries
already
have
stable
populations
and
europe
remains
prosperous
foot
says
an
absence
of
population
growth
results
in
increased
productivity
and
reduced
pressure
on
both
urban
and
rural
environments
theres
no
doubt
foot
adds
that
continuing
to
allow
in
high
numbers
of
immigrants
who
tend
to
be
young
will
hurt
the
children
of
the
baby
boomers
the
echo
boom
as
the
echo
generation
enters
the
labor
market
in
the
first
decade
of
the
next
century
canada
will
need
to
consider
curtailing
immigration
foot
says
it
does
not
make
sense
to
bring
in
a
flood
of
20yearold
immigrants
to
compete
for
scarce
jobs
when
larger
numbers
of
canadianborn
20yearolds
are
also
entering
the
labor
market
doing
so
would
be
unfair
both
to
immigrants
and
to
resident
canadians
solutions
canada
needs
an
immigration
policy
that
balances
humanitarian
concerns
for
those
outside
the
country
with
the
needs
of
a
variety
of
resident
canadians
its
an
ethically
difficult
task
worthy
of
more
public
debate
from
more
sectors
including
labor
which
has
remained
silent
although
it
sounds
harsh
foot
and
borjas
make
a
strong
case
that
federal
immigration
policies
should
not
be
so
strongly
based
as
they
are
now
on
reuniting
families
as
rawls
suggests
one
country
cant
save
the
world
or
even
an
entire
extended
family
however
many
votes
it
might
get
politicians
beyond
refugees
most
potential
immigrants
should
be
carefully
targeted
most
importantly
borjas
and
foot
make
it
emphatically
clear
that
immigration
policies
should
be
linked
to
the
business
and
demographic
cycles
of
the
receiving
country
and
even
provinces
such
as
bc
that
means
cutting
back
on
immigration
when
the
economy
is
weak
and
unemployment
is
high
such
policies
would
help
maximize
gains
and
minimize
losses
for
all
canadians
