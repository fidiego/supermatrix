the
us
department
of
justice
is
suing
arizona
over
the
states
new
immigration
law
known
as
sb
1070
the
longexpected
lawsuit
filed
tuesday
in
the
federal
district
court
of
arizona
asks
a
judge
to
overturn
the
controversial
law
which
requires
arizona
lawenforcement
officers
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
suspect
might
be
in
the
country
illegally
although
opponents
have
questioned
whether
the
law
violates
civil
rights
many
are
concerned
that
police
are
more
likely
to
be
suspicious
of
latinos
and
other
nonwhites
the
suit
mainly
argues
that
the
federal
government
not
any
individual
state
is
responsible
for
enforcing
immigration
law
arizonans
are
understandably
frustrated
with
illegal
immigration
and
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
to
comprehensively
address
those
concerns
attorney
general
eric
holder
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
setting
immigration
policy
and
enforcing
immigration
laws
is
a
national
responsibility
seeking
to
address
the
issue
through
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
will
only
create
more
problems
than
it
solves
the
suit
holds
that
although
states
may
exercise
their
police
power
in
a
manner
that
has
an
incidental
or
indirect
effect
on
aliens
a
state
may
not
establish
its
own
immigration
policy
rep
joe
baca
dsan
bernardino
called
sb
1070
unamerican
and
a
severe
setback
to
our
liberties
its
right
for
them
to
sue
arizona
baca
said
everybody
must
follow
the
constitution
he
like
holder
said
leaving
individual
states
to
create
immigration
law
would
be
disastrous
immigration
is
a
problem
that
can
only
be
solved
by
a
comprehensive
solution
baca
said
there
should
be
a
standard
across
the
us
baca
said
he
believes
sb
1070
will
be
overturned
rep
gary
miller
rbrea
called
the
lawsuit
baseless
this
lawsuit
reveals
the
obama
administrations
contempt
for
immigration
laws
the
people
of
arizona
and
for
the
majority
of
the
american
people
who
support
arizonas
efforts
to
reduce
human
smuggling
drug
trafficking
and
illegal
immigration
he
said
in
a
statement
arizona
has
taken
a
reasonable
and
constitutional
approach
to
dealing
with
a
problem
that
has
been
ignored
and
exacerbated
by
the
obama
administration
tim
donnelly
a
former
minuteman
who
is
running
for
the
59th
district
assembly
seat
said
arizona
has
a
right
to
enact
its
own
immigration
laws
because
the
federal
government
hasnt
protected
the
state
from
what
he
calls
an
invasion
of
illegal
immigrants
he
said
most
americans
regardless
of
party
affiliation
agree
with
the
arizona
law
he
said
immigration
will
likely
be
the
undoing
of
the
obama
presidency
obama
is
not
a
king
donnelly
said
he
serves
at
the
will
of
the
people
the
people
can
throw
him
out
in
the
next
election
and
probably
will
assemblyman
curt
hagman
rchino
hills
said
the
federal
government
has
left
states
with
few
options
but
to
fend
for
themselves
especially
as
states
face
fiscal
crises
while
paying
for
the
effects
of
illegal
immigration
theyre
telling
us
we
have
to
take
care
of
all
these
people
because
theyre
not
going
to
enforce
the
law
hagman
said
that
leaves
us
holding
the
bag
with
billions
and
billions
in
costs
hagman
said
the
obama
administration
should
be
focused
on
securing
us
borders
not
on
suing
american
citizens
thats
a
common
though
not
unanimous
view
in
the
republican
party
assemblyman
anthony
adams
rclaremont
the
man
donnelly
wants
to
replace
said
he
too
wants
the
federal
government
to
enforce
current
laws
but
he
also
said
sb
1070
probably
isnt
constitutional
im
a
huge
states
rights
guy
adams
said
but
the
constitution
is
explicitly
clear
that
immigration
is
solely
under
the
federal
governments
purview
he
said
arizona
lawmakers
have
a
right
to
be
frustrated
but
they
dont
have
the
right
to
enforce
federal
law
on
their
own
a
better
tactic
he
said
would
be
for
arizona
voters
to
put
pressure
on
federal
lawmakers
its
not
acceptable
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
do
nothing
adams
said
but
the
appropriate
response
is
to
kick
out
complacent
politicians
at
the
federal
level
we
should
be
holding
our
federal
politicians
feet
to
the
fire
for
their
lack
of
action
