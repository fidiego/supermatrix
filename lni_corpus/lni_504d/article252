the
historical
parallels
between
abraham
lincolns
famous
a
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
speech
and
congress
protracted
inability
to
pass
an
enforceable
immigration
law
are
compelling
when
lincoln
used
his
house
divided
imagery
in
1858
he
referred
to
our
democracys
inability
to
resolve
a
great
moral
and
legal
issue
by
eradicating
slavery
the
attempt
of
two
senators
from
opposite
political
poles
to
compromise
on
immigration
sen
jon
kyl
arizona
republican
and
sen
ted
kennedy
massachusetts
democrat
will
show
us
how
much
lincolns
house
divided
metaphor
accurately
mirrors
another
great
moral
and
domestic
security
issue
of
our
own
time
congress
unwillingness
to
either
enforce
our
borders
or
define
american
citizenship
and
residency
when
individuals
cross
the
border
illegally
the
new
kylkennedy
immigration
bill
rests
on
a
classic
legislative
compromise
by
1
identifying
and
simplifying
the
primary
goals
of
major
legislators
and
related
coalitions
and
2
then
representing
as
many
of
their
vital
interests
in
the
same
bill
as
possible
without
defeating
or
ignoring
a
given
coalitions
primary
goal
like
legislative
midwives
assisting
in
the
perfect
compromises
attempted
birth
and
delivery
messrs
kyl
and
kennedy
have
adroitly
identified
and
then
served
the
two
primary
coalitions
supporting
an
enforceable
immigration
law
one
coalition
views
immigration
laws
as
vehicles
for
vindicating
the
primacy
of
both
enforceable
democratic
law
and
our
national
or
economic
security
thus
the
new
senate
immigration
bill
would
serve
these
vital
interests
by
requiring
employers
within
18
months
to
electronically
verify
the
immigration
status
of
all
new
employees
from
a
federal
database
building
a
370mile
border
fence
hiring
18500
new
border
patrol
agents
ending
catch
and
release
enforcement
and
allocating
green
cards
according
to
an
economic
security
point
system
that
rewards
job
skills
education
and
english
language
proficiency
more
than
family
ties
by
themselves
except
for
foreignborn
spouses
and
minor
children
a
second
coalition
believes
that
either
humanitarian
grounds
or
desirable
rates
of
economic
and
related
population
growth
associated
with
illegal
aliens
justify
easing
the
penalties
and
visa
prerequisites
of
existing
immigration
laws
the
new
senate
bill
would
serve
these
interests
as
well
by
establishing
a
twoyear
guest
worker
period
renewable
twice
for
between
400000
and
600000
individuals
working
in
jobs
for
which
american
workers
could
not
be
found
requiring
those
renewing
their
guest
worker
status
to
spend
one
year
outside
the
us
and
also
allowing
illegal
immigrants
to
stay
in
the
us
while
applying
for
a
renewable
fouryear
visa
provided
they
paid
significant
civil
fines
and
returned
to
their
home
country
to
file
their
visa
application
just
days
after
the
kylkennedy
senate
compromise
bill
was
announced
major
legislators
in
both
parties
spoke
as
if
they
opposed
not
just
this
particular
compromise
but
achievable
legislative
compromise
itself
for
example
at
least
40
senators
confirmed
almost
immediately
that
they
would
oppose
the
bill
many
without
reading
its
lengthy
text
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
characterized
the
economic
security
point
system
for
green
cards
as
antifamily
because
it
subordinated
traditional
family
unification
immigration
principles
to
the
economic
security
goals
supported
by
opposing
coalitions
likewise
rep
brian
bilbray
republican
chairman
of
the
congressional
immigration
caucus
criticized
the
guest
worker
and
fouryear
visa
programs
because
any
plan
that
rewards
illegal
behavior
is
amnesty
even
though
the
new
visas
would
be
administered
under
the
same
tough
border
enforcement
machinery
that
his
caucus
has
consistently
favored
has
congress
been
rendered
impotent
in
immigration
because
just
as
in
lincolns
time
it
is
controlled
by
large
and
disparate
factions
of
voters
with
sectional
and
economic
interests
antithetical
to
democratic
compromise
undeniably
hispanic
rights
groups
like
the
national
council
of
la
raza
oppose
strict
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
by
arguing
the
sheer
numbers
of
illegal
immigrants
and
their
increasing
political
power
about
40
million
illegal
aliens
will
reside
in
the
us
in
the
next
10
years
justify
disobeying
immigration
laws
declining
to
enforce
them
or
replacing
their
prescribed
penalties
retroactively
with
eventual
american
citizenship
likewise
meatpacking
and
other
corporations
such
as
tyson
foods
and
cargill
supported
2006
demonstrations
against
enforcing
immigration
laws
by
closing
their
plants
similarly
walmart
and
the
national
restaurant
association
sponsored
the
25th
anniversary
of
the
national
immigration
forum
last
week
another
organization
supporting
either
suspending
or
retroactively
ignoring
existing
immigration
laws
interest
groups
opposing
compromise
necessarily
support
the
status
quo
of
not
enforcing
duly
enacted
immigration
laws
sen
lindsey
graham
south
carolina
republican
correctly
points
out
that
doing
nothing
is
a
national
security
nightmare
and
that
therefore
if
you
dont
have
an
alternative
that
will
secure
our
borders
and
deal
with
illegal
immigration
you
are
not
helping
the
country
thus
an
enforceable
legislative
compromise
would
advance
the
most
fundamental
principle
in
immigration
law
today
the
sanctity
and
longevity
of
democratic
law
itself
by
deciding
whether
a
foreign
nationals
first
political
act
on
our
soil
will
be
to
either
flout
or
follow
us
law
congress
simultaneously
defines
and
epitomizes
americas
civic
culture
now
and
in
the
future
in
lincolns
national
house
or
your
own
home
the
inability
to
define
and
control
invitees
is
tantamount
to
abandoning
citizenship
and
ownership
itself
therefore
the
degree
to
which
congress
either
enforces
immigration
laws
or
countenances
their
violation
should
be
decided
not
by
ascertaining
if
old
or
new
immigration
laws
would
make
us
wealthier
or
happier
but
by
the
degree
to
which
both
the
american
people
and
their
government
decide
to
be
or
not
to
be
sovereign
the
numerous
reasons
for
opposing
the
kylkennedy
or
any
other
enforceable
compromise
are
not
nearly
as
important
as
a
republic
healthy
enough
to
rationally
delegate
critical
public
policy
choices
to
congress
rather
than
a
parochial
clique
of
lawbreakers
that
perversely
set
national
immigration
policy
by
either
surreptitiously
hiring
illegally
or
secretly
crossing
our
borders
illegally
absent
a
new
immigration
law
that
can
be
honestly
and
transparently
enforced
democracys
relevance
to
the
immigration
crisis
will
be
as
fictional
as
the
existing
immigration
laws
that
congress
duly
enacted
and
then
quietly
refused
to
enforce
if
undemocratic
and
frequently
unseen
forces
continue
setting
immigration
policy
in
lieu
of
congress
then
both
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
will
enter
a
previously
democratic
house
no
longer
standing
as
a
real
democracy
because
of
destructive
democratic
strife
and
paralysis
just
as
lincoln
feared
