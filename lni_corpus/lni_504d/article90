supreme
courts
decision
to
uphold
the
most
controversial
provision
of
arizonas
immigration
law
while
striking
down
the
rest
of
it
has
sparked
mixed
reactions
among
bakersfield
residents
with
a
stake
in
the
immigration
debate
on
monday
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
section
of
arizonas
support
our
law
enforcement
and
safe
neighborhoods
act
that
requires
police
to
check
the
residency
status
of
those
they
stop
for
other
reasons
meanwhile
the
court
ruled
against
three
provisions
that
created
state
crimes
to
allow
local
police
to
arrest
people
for
federal
immigration
violations
from
2006
to
2010

quick
facts
the
united
farm
workers
expected
the
courts
decision
about
the
law
to
be
split
said
richard
gorman
a
board
of
immigration
appeals
accredited
representative
for
ufw
but
the
union
will
continue
to
fight
the
provision
the
court
upheld
he
added
theres
no
way
show
me
your
papers
can
be
enforced
without
racial
profiling
he
said
the
ufw
is
also
concerned
the
ruling
will
have
implications
in
california
gorman
said
with
arizona
allowed
to
make
its
own
immigration
law
there
is
nothing
stopping
other
states
and
localities
from
passing
their
own
laws
too
he
said
this
creates
the
possibility
of
a
patchwork
of
different
state
and
local
immigration
laws
instead
of
a
single
unified
federal
immigration
policy
he
said
but
at
least
in
some
areas
the
courts
ruling
showed
state
laws
cannot
trump
federal
laws
said
win
eaton
founder
of
18th
streets
eaton
and
associates
which
specializes
in
immigration
law
the
reason
the
court
struck
down
the
three
provisions
it
did
is
because
congress
has
already
passed
laws
specifying
that
immigration
violations
are
civil
offenses
not
criminal
like
arizonas
law
would
have
made
them
eaton
said
he
was
not
surprised
by
the
ruling
and
that
he
is
pleased
the
court
restricted
the
law
somewhat
this
is
an
important
step
for
freedom
he
said
vanessa
santiago
20
born
in
bakersfield
and
raised
in
texas
said
she
understands
arizona
is
trying
to
curb
illegal
immigration
and
protect
its
borders
just
because
people
live
in
harsh
conditions
in
mexico
does
not
make
it
right
to
cross
the
border
illegally
she
said
still
she
said
she
thinks
arizona
might
have
taken
its
law
a
little
further
than
it
needed
to
go
ralph
gutierrez
43
moved
from
arizona
to
bakersfield
four
months
ago
he
was
born
and
raised
in
arizona
he
said
he
thinks
joe
arpaio
the
controversial
sheriff
of
maricopa
county
ariz
who
is
a
staunch
advocate
of
the
law
is
out
of
control
but
that
doesnt
mean
the
law
has
no
merit
gutierrez
said
illegal
immigrants
take
away
legitimate
jobs
because
if
they
come
and
say
theyre
willing
to
work
for
6
and
minimum
wage
is
8
then
someones
going
to
hire
them
and
pay
them
under
the
table
gutierrez
said
still
gutierrez
said
he
is
worried
about
the
possibility
of
the
law
breaking
up
families
by
resulting
in
the
deportation
of
some
family
members
and
not
others
but
he
also
is
not
convinced
he
said
enforcement
of
the
law
will
be
as
barbaric
as
some
people
predict
as
long
as
youre
following
the
law
you
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
said
its
not
just
going
to
be
that
youre
walking
along
and
they
say
hey
