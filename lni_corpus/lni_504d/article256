wealthy
philanthropic
foundations
are
helping
bankroll
the
proimmigration
movement
while
groups
advocating
for
tighter
control
of
us
borders
say
they
take
a
more
grassroots
approach
to
raising
money
the
ford
foundation
the
carnegie
corporation
and
democratic
activist
george
soros
are
among
the
liberal
funders
that
have
donated
millions
of
dollars
to
proimmigration
groups
as
the
senate
continues
its
debate
on
a
contentious
bill
that
would
overhaul
the
nations
immigration
policy
three
of
the
nations
biggest
and
most
influential
proimmigration
groups
the
national
immigration
forum
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
maldef
and
the
national
council
of
la
raza
nclr
collectively
received
more
than
325
million
from
ford
foundation
since
2005
the
three
advocacy
groups
generally
support
the
proposed
senate
bill
which
would
give
many
of
the
estimated
12
million
to
20
million
illegal
aliens
in
the
us
a
path
to
citizenship
the
bill
also
would
allow
aliens
here
to
bring
close
family
members
into
the
country
proimmigration
nonprofit
groups
say
theyre
hardly
awash
in
cash
compared
to
organizations
lobbying
on
other
contentious
issues
such
as
abortion
the
environment
and
tort
reform
to
me
its
remarkable
how
little
money
goes
into
immigration
reform
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
its
lilliputian
mr
sharry
said
groups
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
issue
can
rightfully
be
considered
grassroots
outfits
we
have
a
staff
of
only
10
people
mr
sharry
said
of
his
group
which
supports
allowing
aliens
a
path
to
legal
residency
or
citizenship
these
groups
on
all
sides
of
the
debate
are
small
intense
and
highly
informed
but
groups
supporting
stronger
immigration
policy
and
tighter
border
control
say
they
rely
more
on
small
donations
from
individuals
than
large
foundations
numbersusa
which
says
it
has
366000
members
saw
its
membership
grow
50
percent
since
jan
1
and
18
percent
in
may
spokeswoman
caroline
espinosa
said
twothirds
of
the
groups
financial
support
comes
from
private
people
with
the
average
donation
being
40
contrary
to
what
might
be
popular
belief
is
that
the
grassroots
aspect
is
more
on
our
side
than
the
proimmigration
side
mrs
espinosa
said
they
have
more
of
these
organized
established
types
of
groups
funding
them
and
driving
their
activism
john
tanton
a
retired
smalltown
michigan
ophthalmologist
who
helped
organize
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
numbersusa
and
the
center
for
immigration
studies
says
money
alone
wont
win
the
immigration
debate
money
can
be
a
help
but
it
also
can
be
a
hindrance
he
said
if
you
dont
have
to
go
out
and
meet
the
public
and
get
shouted
at
and
get
directmail
surveys
rejected
then
you
wont
know
about
the
pulse
of
the
public
weve
had
our
share
of
major
supporters
but
weve
had
to
rely
on
nickelanddime
support
mr
tanton
said
a
complete
list
of
funders
isnt
available
as
these
lobby
groups
are
not
legally
required
to
report
their
funding
sources
but
many
major
philanthropic
institutions
make
at
least
part
of
their
donor
lists
public
showing
a
strong
proimmigration
bias
in
their
donating
the
open
society
institute
run
by
mr
soros
has
given
825000
from
2002
to
2004
to
the
national
immigration
forum
mr

2004
also
has
donated
525000
to
nclr
and

to
maldef
during
the
same
period
the
ford
foundation
with
assets
of
more
than
9
billion
is
known
to
favor
liberal
causes
the
foundation
was
significantly
criticized
in
2003
after
it
gave
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
grants
to
palestinian
nonprofit
groups
that
later
were
accused
of
conducting
terrorist
activities
the
carnegie
corporation
has
contributed
almost
7
million
collectively
to
the
national
immigration
forum
maldef
and
nclr
since
1994
nclr
also
collected
almost
22
million
from
the
john
d
and
catherine
t
macarthur
foundation
from
2003
to
2005
and
425000
from
the
rockefeller
foundation
since

the
rockefeller
foundation
since
2004
also
have
given
more
than
1
million
to
maldef
and
300000
to
the
national
immigration
law
center
about
onethird
of
nclrs
budget
comes
from
foundations
nclr
spokeswoman
lisa
navarrete
said
noting
however
that
her
group
cannot
use
money
from
taxexempt
foundations
for
political
purposes
but
rather
uses
it
to
support
its
other
functions
foundation
money
is
used
strictly
for
policy
purposes
and
research
work
she
said
we
keep
a
strict
line
on
that
less
than
2
percent
of
nclrs
budget
is
used
to
promote
its
immigration
agenda
she
added
were
a
latino
advocacy
group
what
we
do
is
much
broader
than
just
immigration
ms
navarrete
said
advocacy
groups
on
the
other
side
of
the
immigration
debate
are
not
without
some
financial
support
from
philanthropic
entities
the
conservative
scaife
foundations
of
pittsburgh
gave
fair
one
of
the
biggest
immigrationcontrol
nonprofit
groups
775000
from
2003
to
2005
the
foundations
during
the
same
time
period
also
gave
420000
to
the
center
for
immigration
studies
and
100000
to
the
numbersusa
education
and
research
foundation
groups
also
that
advocate
tighter
border
control
and
restricting
the
flow
of
immigrants
the
scaife
foundations
which
include
the
sarah
scaife
and
carthage
foundations
are
connected
with
conservative
billionaire
richard
mellon
scaife
the
principal
heir
to
the
mellon
banking
oil
and
aluminum
fortune
the
fm
kirby
foundation
which
has
supported
many
conservative
nonprofit
groups
in
recent
years
gave
475000
to
numbersusa
since
1998
and
donated
more
than
375000
to
fair
since
2000
but
overall
opponents
of
the
bill
say
they
rely
more
on
strength
in
membership
numbers
that
translates
beyond
donations
noting
the
more
than
750000
faxes
opposing
the
senate
bill
sent
to
members
of
congress
last
month
this
just
shows
how
angry
people
are
about
this
bill
and
over
the
idea
of
amnesty
and
allowing
12
million
illegal
aliens
to
remain
here
in
this
country
and
basically
get
rewarded
for
breaking
the
law
