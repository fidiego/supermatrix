a
national
association
of
immigration
lawyers
said
yesterday
that
it
would
bring
a
classaction
lawsuit
against
the
federal
immigration
agency
for
refusing
to
accept
thousands
of
applications
for
workbased
permanent
visas
from
highly
skilled
immigrants
who
were
encouraged
by
the
government
to
apply
according
to
accounts
yesterday
by
officials
and
lawyers
the
immigrants
were
caught
in
a
confrontation
between
the
two
federal
bodies
that
control
the
immigration
system
the
state
department
and
the
citizenship
and
immigration
services
the
hopes
of
thousands
of
foreigners
who
have
been
working
legally
in
the
united
states
were
unexpectedly
raised
and
then
abruptly
dashed
as
a
result
of
the
disagreement
they
had
responded
last
month
to
an
announcement
that
permanent
residency
visas
would
be
available
but
on
monday
learned
there
were
none
the
immigration
lawyers
said
the
aboutface
by
the
immigration
system
had
no
precedent
in
at
least
three
decades
of
legal
practice
and
said
that
it
violated
the
immigration
agencys
regulations
the
american
immigration
lawyers
associations
legal
action
arm
was
preparing
the
lawsuit
said
crystal
williams
deputy
director
federal
officials
said
a
misunderstanding
had
arisen
from
an
effort
by
both
agencies
to
reduce
huge
backlogs
of
applications
for
permanent
residence
visas
known
as
green
cards
immigration
officials
acknowledged
that
the
effort
was
poorly
handled
was
there
a
lack
of
communication
between
us
and
the
state
department
said
william
g
wright
a
spokesman
for
the
immigration
agency
certainly
the
episode
started
on
june
12
when
the
state
department
announced
in
a
monthly
bulletin
that
green
cards
would
be
available
starting
july
2
for
applicants
across
the
range
of
highskilled
categories
that
was
a
signal
to
immigrants
who
have
been
working
in
this
country
on
temporary
visas
that
they
would
be
able
to
apply
to
become
permanent
residents
thousands
of
immigrants
rushed
to
obtain
certified
documents
assemble
employer
sponsorship
papers
take
medical
examinations
and
dispatch
their
applications
many
canceled
travel
plans
so
they
could
be
in
the
united
states
when
their
applications
arrived
on
july
2
as
the
law
required
but
on
monday
the
state
department
announced
that
no
more
green
cards
were
available
snared
in
the
turnabout
were
welleducated
highly
skilled
legal
immigrants
many
of
them
doctors
and
medical
technicians
with
long
work
experience
in
this
country
all
had
obtained
federal
certification
that
no
american
workers
were
available
for
the
jobs
they
hold
the
episode
laid
bare
conflicting
interests
between
the
state
department
which
manages
the
offering
of
visas
and
the
citizenship
and
immigration
services
a
branch
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
that
processes
the
visa
applications
by
law
only
about
140000
employmentbased
visas
are
available
annually
so
there
are
huge
backlogs
of
applications
state
department
officials
said
their
june
alert
that
visas
were
available
was
intended
to
prompt
the
immigration
agency
to
speed
its
processing
so
that
no
visas
would
go
unused
since
2000
a
total
of
182694
workbased
visas
have
not
been
given
out
because
the
immigration
agency
had
fallen
behind
in
processing
applications
according
to
the
2007
report
of
the
immigration
agencys
ombudsman
we
were
determined
that
every
employment
number
that
was
available
would
be
used
june
kunsman
the
acting
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
visa
services
said
yesterday
immigration
agency
officials
said
they
were
surprised
by
the
departments
action
they
said
they
immediately
advised
the
department
that
they
had
already
finished
approving
enough
applications
to
use
60000
visas
of
those
offered
department
officials
did
not
revise
their
public
notice
offering
visas
we
said
we
already
have
more
than
enough
applications
and
we
expect
to
complete
them
in
time
to
use
the
visa
numbers
said
mike
aytes
director
of
domestic
policy
operations
at
the
immigration
agency
to
complete
the
applications
in
time
the
immigration
agency
put
employees
to
work
both
days
last
weekend
at
service
centers
in
texas
and
nebraska
immigration
officials
said
they
said
that
25000
applications
were
processed
in
the
final
48
hours
before
mondays
deadline
in
some
cases
security
clearances
required
by
the
fbi
were
not
entirely
completed
immigration
officials
said
the
agency
approved
some
applications
when
we
were
certain
the
process
will
be
completed
very
shortly
mr
aytes
said
in
its
bulletin
on
monday
the
state
department
said
that
unexpected
action
by
the
immigration
agency
had
used
up
all
the
visas
for
the
2007
fiscal
year
the
news
was
crushing
to
murtuza
bahrainwala
a
38yearold
occupational
medicine
doctor
from
india
who
works
at
decatur
memorial
hospital
in
illinois
after
nearly
12
years
working
as
a
physician
on
temporary
visas
dr
bahrainwala
believed
in
june
that
his
chance
for
a
green
card
had
finally
come
apply
for
citizenship
thats
absolutely
what
we
want
to
do
he
said
once
he
has
a
green
card
his
wife
would
also
be
authorized
to
work
and
he
could
accept
promotions
and
change
jobs
which
he
cannot
do
with
a
temporary
visa
but
because
the
application
he
delivered
on
monday
was
not
accepted
dr
bahrainwala
may
have
to
wait
four
or
five
years
to
apply
again
right
from
complete
ecstasy
you
go
down
to
the
depths
of
depression
dr
bahrainwala
said
i
have
never
been
illegal
a
single
day
in
this
country
maybe
i
should
have
just
crossed
the
rio
grande
he
added
immigration
lawyers
said
that
the
situation
punished
immigrants
who
were
identified
as
highly
desirable
by
the
system
and
who
have
always
gone
by
the
book
theyve
played
by
the
rules
for
years
said
daryl
buffenstein
cochairman
of
the
global
immigration
practice
at
paul
hastings
a
law
firm
now
the
government
is
not
playing
by
the
rules
