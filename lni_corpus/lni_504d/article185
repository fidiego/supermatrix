business
groups
which
have
clashed
with
democrats
over
everything
from
health
care
to
wall
street
reform
have
been
working
quietly
with
congressional
leaders
and
another
one
of
their
typical
opponents
unions
to
seek
an
immigration
overhaul
for
months
organizations
such
as
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
the
national
restaurant
association
and
the
national
association
of
home
builders
have
been
engaged
in
regular
meetings
with
labor
unions
and
key
senate
staffers
to
figure
out
how
to
revamp
the
nations
visa
system
to
ensure
a
future
flow
of
legal
immigrants
who
are
able
to
work
in
this
country
such
a
provision
would
be
a
key
part
of
a
comprehensive
immigration
package
outlined
by
sens
charles
schumer
dny
and
lindsey
graham
rsc
their
asyetunveiled
bill
would
deal
with
the
politically
charged
issue
of
illegal
immigration
no
one
has
more
of
a
stake
in
fixing
the
system
than
businesses
said
tamar
jacoby
president
of
immigrationworks
usa
which
is
composed
of
state
employers
and
trade
associations
but
jacoby
who
has
participated
in
the
talks
on
immigration
with
schumer
and
graham
staffers
also
said
there
is
wariness
in
the
business
community
about
how
sincere
the
administration
is
in
promoting
immigration
this
year
some
worry
that
the
recent
push
is
mostly
posturing
so
the
democrats
can
energize
hispanic
voters
for
the
midterm
elections
they
also
fear
that
lack
of
bipartisan
participation
will
jeopardize
the
latest
initiative
there
is
concern
this
is
not
a
serious
effort
jacoby
said
but
if
it
is
serious
we
will
be
there
participating
the
issue
has
rocketed
to
the
top
of
the
national
agenda
in
recent
days
with
the
approval
of
tough
measures
by
arizonas
gopdominated
legislature
that
give
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
state
expanded
powers
to
stop
and
arrest
illegal
immigrants
the
new
law
which
was
signed
by
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
r
last
week
triggered
sharp
criticism
from
hispanic
groups
and
president
barack
obama
who
called
the
measure
misguided
and
urged
congress
to
address
comprehensive
immigration
reform
however
the
pledge
by
obama
and
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
dnev
to
tackle
the
complex
issue
elicited
a
stinging
rebuke
from
graham
the
south
carolina
republican
accused
reid
of
engaging
in
a
phony
political
effort
on
immigration
that
would
threaten
the
success
of
a
climate
change
measure
that
graham
was
also
working
on
with
democratic
senators
prospects
for
the
immigration
measure
appeared
to
dim
tuesday
as
reid
said
he
would
take
up
climate
change
legislation
first
and
graham
said
there
was
no
hope
of
passing
broad
immigration
changes
this
year
nahb
president
and
ceo
jerry
howard
said
that
while
his
group
had
been
very
engaged
in
the
talks
he
feared
that
if
graham
isnt
in
the
room
for
the
negotiations
on
the
bill
the
prospects
for
it
going
anywhere
are
significantly
diminished
howard
said
there
must
be
republicans
or
conservative
businessoriented
democrats
involved
as
of
tuesday
afternoon
it
was
unclear
whether
the
group
would
meet
this
week
to
discuss
the
immigration
issue
participants
said
with
all
the
political
fireworks
business
groups
said
they
want
to
make
sure
the
talks
on
immigration
lead
to
legislation
that
has
a
realistic
chance
of
passage
we
want
a
bill
that
is
good
policy
that
will
become
enacted
said
randy
johnson
us
chamber
of
commerce
senior
vice
president
for
labor
immigration
and
employee
benefits
on
its
website
the
chamber
lists
immigration
as
one
of
its
priorities
for
the
111th
congress
and
says
the
organization
will
continue
to
push
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
increases
security
the
chamber
also
supports
the
creation
of
a
carefully
monitored
guest
or
essential
worker
program
to
fill
the
growing
gaps
in
americans
workforce
the
chamber
backed
immigration
reform
the
last
time
the
issue
came
up
in
2007
when
president
george
w
bush
endorsed
congressional
efforts
to
approve
a
comprehensive
bill
however
that
bill
cosponsored
by
sen
john
mccain
rariz
died
in
part
because
of
strong
opposition
from
conservative
republicans
who
were
suspicious
of
efforts
to
create
a
temporaryworker
program
for
undocumented
immigrants
and
establish
a
path
to
citizenship
the
failure
of
the
measure
highlighted
the
rift
in
the
republican
party
between
its
business
wing
concerned
with
filling
jobs
and
more
populist
elements
within
the
party
that
fear
illegal
immigrants
are
overrunning
their
communities
antiimmigration
groups
argue
businesses
support
some
of
the
immigration
reform
provisions
simply
because
it
helps
their
bottom
lines
the
goal
for
big
business
is
the
minimal
amount
of
hassle
to
get
cheap
labor
said
julie
kirchner
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
is
focused
on
stopping
illegal
immigration
and
increasing
border
security
howard
at
nahb
however
said
his
group
has
a
vested
interest
in
immigration
laws
since
immigrants
have
historically
been
the
backbone
of
the
construction
industry
from
the
irish
workers
of
the
past
century
to
the
current
hispanic
employees
when
the
economy
was
booming
he
said
we
couldnt
get
a
lot
of
people
to
take
construction
jobs
on
the
other
end
of
the
economic
spectrum
a
spokeswoman
for
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
said
immigration
reform
is
also
needed
to
ensure
that
the
us
retains
skilled
workers
in
a
global
economy
the
manufacturers
association
has
been
focusing
on
increasing
visas
for
the
large
number
of
foreignborn
college
graduates
in
specialties
such
as
science
and
technology
manufacturers
often
do
not
have
access
to
these
potential
workers
because
of
outdated
immigration
laws
nam
spokeswoman
erin
streeter
said
streeter
added
that
her
group
wants
to
see
the
green
card
system
simplified
and
a
more
efficient
way
for
employers
to
verify
if
their
employees
are
legal
within
the
democratic
party
organized
labor
has
in
the
past
expressed
concern
that
illegal
immigrants
drive
down
wages
however
both
the
service
employees
international
union
and
the
aflcio
have
participated
in
the
talks
with
business
on
the
visa
program
for
future
workers
there
is
pretty
much
a
united
sense
that
you
got
to
fix
this
said
sam
medina
executive
vice
president
of
the
seiu
medina
said
the
common
ground
between
the
unions
and
businesses
on
immigration
were
very
unique
no
other
issue
unites
us
like
this
one
he
said
medina
said
the
groups
were
close
to
an
agreement
on
the
visa
issue
but
one
business
lobbyist
said
privately
that
they
were
not
close
enough
to
the
point
of
drafting
legislation
but
were
holding
conversations
at
the
30000foot
level
as
business
and
union
groups
work
behind
the
scenes
other
immigration
reform
advocates
have
been
working
more
publicly
to
drum
up
support
such
as
the
recent
large
rally
promoted
by
hispanic
groups
in
washington
i
think
there
has
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
organizing
said
clarissa
martinez
de
castro
director
of
immigration
and
national
campaigns
for
the
national
council
of
la
raza
she
said
the
passage
of
the
arizona
law
has
become
a
lightning
rod
and
watershed
moment
for
those
in
the
hispanic
community
seeking
immigration
reform
she
said
the
effort
was
deeper
and
broader
than
in
2007
with
more
events
planned
and
a
phone
campaign
to
members
of
congress
under
way
at
the
same
time
martinez
de
castro
acknowledged
that
pledges
to
move
ahead
with
immigration
reform
may
involve
some
political
posturing
after
all
this
is
