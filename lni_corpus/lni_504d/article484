immigration
officials
met
with
local
authorities
yesterday
to
plead
for
the
reopening
of
the
immigration
jail
in
elizabeth
nj
assuring
them
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
would
consider
their
ideas
about
how
to
make
it
a
better
place
the
immigration
officials
said
the
service
would
consider
raising
guards
wages
creating
a
civilian
review
board
or
even
ending
its
contract
with
esmor
correctional
services
the
private
company
that
runs
the
300bed
detention
center
that
exploded
in
violence
on
sunday
everything
is
on
the
table
carol
d
chasse
the
eastern
regional
director
of
the
federal
immigration
agency
said
in
an
interview
i
understand
peoples
anger
but
we
need
to
work
together
because
we
need
a
facility
there
ms
chasse
and
other
immigration
officials
met
with
union
county
prosecutor
andrew
k
ruotolo
jr
who
said
this
week
that
he
would
fight
the
reopening
of
the
yearold
jail
because
it
was
so
poorly
run
that
it
constituted
a
threat
to
public
safety
she
also
met
with
representative
robert
menendez
who
had
persuaded
the
immigration
service
to
investigate
conditions
at
the
detention
center
before
the
uprising
with
ralph
froehlich
the
union
county
sheriff
and
with
elizabeth
officials
after
the
meetings
mr
ruotolo
and
ms
chasse
announced
that
the
agency
and
local
law
enforcement
authorities
would
conduct
separate
but
cooperative
investigations
of
the
uprising
ms
chasse
said
she
believed
that
there
were
many
options
that
could
ease
local
officials
fears
and
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
immigration
service
which
detains
most
illegal
immigrants
caught
at
airports
until
the
courts
resolve
their
deportation
or
asylum
cases
ms
chasse
said
the
esmor
facility
could
be
turned
into
a
shortterm
staging
center
where
immigrants
would
be
held
briefly
before
being
transferred
to
other
detention
centers
it
could
also
decide
not
to
renew
its
contract
with
esmor
based
in
melville
li
she
said
the
contract
expires
this
year
although
there
is
an
option
to
renew
for
four
more
years
she
said
because
esmor
owns
the
detention
center
on
evans
street
just
south
of
newark
international
airport
ending
the
contract
could
force
the
immigration
service
to
find
a
new
site
james
f
slattery
the
chairman
of
esmor
would
not
comment
on
his
companys
possible
loss
of
its
contract
with
the
immigration
service
he
released
a
statement
saying
we
support
fully
the
ins
and
their
efforts
to
reopen
the
center
ms
chasse
said
a
detention
center
in
the
newark
area
was
crucial
because
of
the
high
number
of
illegal
immigrants
apprehended
at
the
airport
she
said
the
center
is
particularly
important
because
of
an
expected
expansion
of
service
at
the
airport
in
october
that
could
double
the
number
of
passengers
each
year
im
hoping
we
can
take
their
concerns
and
come
up
with
a
solution
she
said
late
thursday
commissioner
doris
m
meissner
of
the
immigration
service
ordered
all
of
its
local
offices
to
review
immigration
detention
centers
in
their
areas
we
must
meet
our
legal
obligation
to
detain
these
aliens
she
said
but
we
must
and
will
insure
that
any
facility
we
use
for
detention
is
safe
secure
and
humane
the
immigration
service
started
an
investigation
of
the
esmor
detention
center
about
two
weeks
before
the
uprising
on
sunday
morning
detainees
through
their
lawyers
had
complained
of
substandard
conditions
and
harsh
treatment
mr
slattery
said
this
week
that
the
detainees
were
more
frustrated
by
the
length
of
incarceration
than
by
the
conditions
at
the
center
he
said
they
averaging
more
than
six
months
in
a
jail
designed
for
shortterm
use
ms
chasse
said
yesterday
that
detention
had
been
prolonged
because
there
was
only
one
immigration
judge
at
the
center
she
said
the
service
was
hiring
more
judges
when
the
uprising
occurred
but
she
added
that
it
was
premature
to
blame
the
prolonged
stays
for
the
riots
the
300
detainees
have
have
been
transferred
to
detention
centers
and
local
jails
around
the
east
coast
the
immigration
service
has
begun
moving
them
to
the
philadelphia
area
and
has
set
up
a
telephone
line
there
to
help
lawyers
and
relatives
find
them
