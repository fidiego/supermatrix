republican
candidates
for
mayor
and
borough
council
seats
in
bogota
are
urging
republican
mayor
steve
lonegan
not
to
apply
for
a
federal
program
that
deputizes
local
police
to
enforce
immigration
laws
the
candidates
who
include
a
councilwoman
expressed
concern
that
the
federal
deputizing
program
known
as
287g
would
strain
police
resources
in
bogota
as
well
as
lead
to
civil
rights
violations
our
local
police
should
not
have
the
added
duty
of
helping
the
federal
government
enforce
the
us
immigration
and
nationality
act
said
mayoral
candidate
andrew
t
fede
a
lawyer
and
we
are
concerned
that
some
believe
that
the
program
could
be
abused
as
a
profiling
tool
against
hispanicamericans
lonegan
who
is
not
seeking
reelection
is
one
of
the
states
most
vocal
proponents
of
strict
immigration
enforcement
he
said
last
month
that
he
was
considering
applying
for
the
program
he
said
illegal
immigration
was
not
a
significant
problem
in
bogota
but
that
he
felt
287g
would
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
undocumented
people
who
might
otherwise
settle
in
bogota
councilwoman
anne
marie
mitchell
who
is
running
for
reelection
on
the
same
slate
as
fede
was
on
the
list
of
candidates
who
released
the
statement
opposing
287g
she
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
at
least
one
new
jersey
mayor
morristowns
donald
cresitello
has
applied
to
the
us
department
of
homeland
security
for
admission
into
287g
he
says
he
is
still
awaiting
a
decision
the
federal
program
has
gained
attention
nationwide
as
local
officials
are
making
moves
to
address
illegal
immigration
citing
the
failure
of
national
political
leaders
to
reform
the
flawed
immigration
system
moreover
the
illegal
immigrant
status
and
prior
record
of
at
least
one
suspect
in
the
killings
of
three
young
adults
in
newark
last
week
intensified
the
debate
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere
over
287g
lonegan
and
others
who
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
say
the
ability
of
murder
suspect
jose
carranza
an
illegal
immigrant
from
peru
to
roam
the
streets
before
the
killings
despite
pending
assault
and
childrape
charges
underscores
the
need
for
steppedup
contact
between
local
authorities
and
immigration
agents
many
say
police
should
routinely
check
immigration
status
during
the
normal
course
of
their
work
the
recent
tragedy
in
newark
shows
why
this
program
is
needed
now
more
than
ever
lonegan
said
in
response
to
the
republican
candidates
publicly
circulated
statement
opposing
the
mayors
support
of
287g
had
newark
implemented
this
program
it
would
have
acted
as
a
deterrent
and
i
believe
three
students
would
be
alive
today
lonegan
added
that
287g
could
be
a
great
tool
for
bogota
police
to
discourage
criminals
from
even
coming
to
our
town
and
could
stop
a
tragedy
like
this
from
happening
in
bogota
but
immigration
advocacy
groups
argue
that
deputizing
local
police
as
immigration
agents
could
cause
a
rift
between
town
police
departments
and
immigrant
communities
they
say
immigrants
who
see
police
as
quasiimmigration
agents
would
be
reluctant
to
come
forward
as
crime
victims
or
witnesses
law
enforcement
agencies
at
local
county
and
state
levels
who
are
deputized
to
enforce
immigration
laws
get
access
to
an
immigration
database
where
they
can
check
an
immigrants
status
and
other
information
these
deputized
authorities
can
then
detain
a
person
for
immigration
violations
and
begin
deportation
proceedings
against
them
agencies
in
about
a
dozen
states
are
part
of
the
287g
program
but
only
two
police
departments
in
new
hampshire
and
virginia
have
been
admitted
into
it
some
75
agencies
at
all
levels
of
government
have
applications
pending
for
admission
according
to
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
the
agency
within
homeland
security
that
runs
287g
bogota
councilwoman
yesenia
frias
a
democrat
has
vowed
to
fight
any
effort
by
lonegan
to
deputize
police
to
enforce
immigration
laws
in
council
meetings
she
has
on
several
occasions
expressed
her
opposition
to
287g
the
two
other
republican
candidates
for
council
seats
richard
gil
de
leon
and
daniele
fede
joined
in
the
statement
opposing
an
application
for
the
program
while
the
idea
of
launching
deportation
proceedings
against
felons
in
this
country
who
are
not
citizens
or
legal
visitors
is
a
worthy
goal
andrew
fede
said
nothing
prevents
our
local
police
from
cooperating
with
federal
immigration
officials
when
they
find
it
to
be
necessary
for
public
safety
