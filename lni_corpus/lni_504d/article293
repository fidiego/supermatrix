debate
thursday
the
issue
is
not
immigration
per
se
its
about
illegal
immigration
to
top
it
off
we
have
such
illustrious
leaders
as
sen
edward
kennedy
dmass
offering
socalled
solutions
such
as
allowing
people
who
came
here
illegally
to
work
in
the
usa
for
six
years
then
permit
them
to
become
citizens
did
anyone
hear
of
exploitation
what
about
upholding
the
laws
of
the
united
states
politicians
need
to
stop
posturing
for
reelection
and
deal
with
the
hard
issues
they
are
in
office
to
deal
with
including

immigration
still
works
we
must
protect
our
borders
and
insist
upon
legal
immigration
first
anyone
in
this
country
illegally
needs
to
be
sent
home
immediately
and
our
borders
must
be
sealed
for
protection
against
terrorists
and
from
people
who
want
a
pay
check
but
arent
willing
to
pledge
allegiance
to
our
country
immigration
the
oldfashioned
way
has
worked
since
the
birth
of
this
nation
it
must
continue
immigrants
who
come
here
legally
learn
the
language
and
eventually
take
a
pledge
of
allegiance
are
always
welcomed
this
way
helps
maintain
the
unique
and
vibrant
culture
that
makes
us
what
we
are
otherwise
forget
july

start
celebrating

what
about
us
security
it
is
disgraceful
that
the
illegal
immigration
fanatics
who
have
no
regard
whatsoever
for
our
national
security
the
rule
of
law
or
the
welfare
of
300
million
americans
want
an
unlimited
unregulated
amount
of
immigrants
to
be
allowed
to
enter
the
usa
illegal
immigration
already
costs
us
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
yearly
not
to
mention
the
lost
wages
resulting
from
illegal
immigrants
taking
jobs
at
the
lower
end
of
the
economic
ladder
illegal
immigration
lowers
the
wage
scale
and
hurts
the
middle
class
it
is
a
major
cause
of
overpopulation
in
our
country
and
cannot
continue
unabated
without
serious
detrimental
and
irreparable
harm
to
life
as
we
know
it
in
the
usa

countrys
borders
are
weak
i
see
on
the
news
there
are
marches
and
protests
against
immigration
reform
in
this
country
how
is
it
possible
that
there
are
people
in
this
country
who
do
not
feel
immigration
is
out
of
control
how
is
it
that
anyone
in
this
country
can
be
against
some
sort
of
immigration
reform
what
is
the
problem
with
proposing
some
effort
to
curb
the
illegal
invasion
happening
in
the
usa
what
is
the
problem
with
trying
to
fix
the
already
strained
social
services
departments
caused
in
part
by
the
influx
of
illegal
immigrants
this
countrys
borders
are
weak
and
failing
more
every
day
until
we
strengthen
the
borders
our
safety
our
culture
and
our
way
of
life
are
all
in
danger
it
is
time
to
roll
up
the
welcome
mats
at
the
borders
and
replace
them
with
keep

signs

solutions
will
take
guts
when
it
comes
to
getting
a
deal
on
immigration
congress
has
no
guts
just
as
our
lawmakers
lack
guts
to
deal
with
other
larger
problems
facing
this
country
such
as
social
security
and
the
war
in
iraq
our
politicians
dont
want
to
upset
their
political
base
a
fair
deal
in
my
view
would
be
to
allow
illegal
immigrants
who
are
in
this
country
six
months
to
register
with
immigration
authorities
without
facing
criminal
charges
let
them
have
their
cases
heard
as
to
why
they
should
or
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
in
this
country
after
that
and
no
matter
what
no
one
should
be
allowed
to
remain
in
this
country
illegally
and
anyone
who
gives
illegal
immigrants
cover
should
face
charges
and
a
stiff
jail
sentence
