sweeping
attempt
to
curb
illegal
immigration
may
ultimately
end
up
in
a
courtroom
a
lawyer
for
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
which
opened
an
atlanta
office
in
2002
has
publicly
said
many
times
she
believes
senate
bill
529
the
georgia
security
and
immigration
compliance
act
runs
afoul
of
federal
law
the
bottom
line
is
the
federal
government
congress
and
the
bush
administration
are
in
charge
of
regulating
immigration
tisha
tallman
regional
counsel
for
maldef
repeated
on
wednesday
and
so
states
shouldnt
get
involved
in
matters
that
regulate
someones
entrance
into
a
state
based
on
immigration
status
or
regulate
how
they
stay
in
a
particular
state
based
on
immigration
status
sb
529
sponsor
sen
chip
rogers
rwoodstock
maintained
wednesday
that
his
bill
was
crafted
to
withstand
a
legal
challenge
noting
that
it
was
reviewed
by
several
lawyers
inside
and
outside
of
the
capitol
weve
worked
long
and
hard
to
ensure
that
we
have
a
legally
sound
piece
of
legislation
rogers
said
much
of
the
bill
contains
tools
that
have
been
given
to
the
state
and
local
government
by
the
federal
government
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
among
its
provisions
sb
529
would
require
state
and
local
government
agencies
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
adults
applying
for
taxpayerprovided
benefits
in
georgia
it
also
requires
that
companies
doing
business
with
the
state
check
the
legal
status
of
new
employees
and
that
jailers
report
illegal
immigrants
arrested
for
felonies
or
dui
to
federal
immigration
authorities
maldef
which
counts
22
lawyers
among
its
staff
of
75
employees
has
sued
other
states
over
similar
measures
with
varying
degrees
of
success
in
california
maldef
helped
dismantle
major
portions
of
proposition
187
a
1994
ballot
initiative
that
sought
to
deny
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
but
in
arizona
maldef
hasnt
been
able
to
defeat
proposition
200
a
similar
ballot
initiative
approved
in
november
2004
maldef
used
the
federal
preemption
argument
in
attempting
to
strike
down
proposition
200
arguing
that
the
regulation
of
immigration
law
is
the
sole
domain
of
the
federal
government
michael
hethmon
a
lawyer
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reforms
legal
arm
said
georgias
law
is
on
a
cutting
edge
development
in
this
area
of
the
law
and
will
be
closely
watched
by
advocates
on
both
sides
hethmon
helped
advise
rogers
on
the
legal
aspects
of
sb
529
and
believes
it
will
pass
judicial
muster
washingtonbased
fair
opposes
illegal
immigration
when
legislators
come
to
me
with
ideas
about
local
or
state
enforcement
or
verification
i
simply
apply
the
lessons
learned
from
proposition
187
out
in
california
said
hethmon
i
explain
to
them
unless
you
prepare
these
measures
with
some
precision
youre
inviting
a
challenge
on
preemption
grounds
but
hethmon
said
its
very
clear
that
states
can
enforce
federal
immigration
law
within
their
borders
and
verify
immigration
status
atlanta
immigration
attorney
robert
banta
said
congress
current
efforts
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
could
cast
an
overriding
shadow
over
georgias
legislation
by
specifically
prohibiting
states
from
wading
into
immigration
law
otherwise
a
states
role
in
regulating
illegal
immigration
is
far
from
settled
banta
said
tallman
declined
to
detail
maldefs
potential
claims
against
sb
529
saying
only
that
the
organization
is
preparing
for
potential
litigation
against
the
state
maldef
and
other
latino
advocacy
groups
are
presently
focusing
their
efforts

the
general
assembly
on
tuesday
and
perdue
has
40
days
after
the
legislative
session
ends
today
to
consider
the
bill
perdue
has
said
in
the
past
that
immigrants
fill
jobs
crucial
to
georgias
economy
and
has
cautioned
against
punitive
measures
but
hes
likely
to
sign
the
bill
in
a
year
when
he
is
seeking
reelection
