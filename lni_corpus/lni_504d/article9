last

a
feeble
attempt
was
made
to
bring
immigration
reform
back
from
the
dead
it
happened
on
sept
6
when
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
held
a
hearing
on
the
strive
act
the
bipartisan
immigration
reform
legislation
introduced
this
year
by
rep
jeff
flake
rariz
and
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
americans
do
not
share
congress
unwillingness
to
tackle
immigration
reform
flake
said
at
the
hearing
he
was
reminding
everyone
that
poll
after
poll
has
shown
that
the
majority
of
americans
favor
a
workable
law
that
includes
a
path
to
legalization
for
the
12
million
undocumented
people
already
in
the
us
some
immigration
advocates
were
mildly
hopeful
just
because
the
hearing
was
taking
place
reality
though
does
not
support
such
optimism
the
house
immigration
subcommittees
hearing
on
immigration
reform
makes
us
hopeful
that
some
politicians
understand
that
realistic
immigration
reform
is
still
a
priority
said
angela
kelly
deputy
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
but
the
hearing
still
mired
in
futile
discussions
about
things
like
amnesty
did
not
go
far
or
cover
any
new
ground
after
the
hearing
good
intentions
notwithstanding
the
corpse
was
simply
put
back
in
the
grave
it
is
true
of
course
that
many
politicians
understand
the
urgency
of
workable
immigration
reform
but
the
antiimmigration
extremists
fearmongering
and
nativist
demagoguery
have
been
effective
in
quashing
any
attempt
to
have
such
law
seriously
discussed
not
to
mention
approved
in
the
foreseeable
future
yet
the
failure
of
congress
to
do
its
job
has
had
serious
consequences
in
many
different
areas
the
cruel
separation
of
families
is
of
course
one
of
them
but
small
business
owners
and
employers
also
have
been
affected
the
failure
to
pass
comprehensive
reform
has
also
spurred
a
flood
of
conflicting
fragmented
and
often
intolerant
state
and
local
ordinances
on
immigration
the
us
hispanic
chamber
of
commerce
president
and
ceo
michael
barrera
told
the
house
and
he
added
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
needed
now
if
we
are
to
put
an
end
to
the
more
than
1400
state
and
local
laws
most
being
hostile
to
small
businesses
and
immigrants
that
have
been
introduced
or
passed
in
the
last
two
years
the
arguments
in
favor
of
urgent
immigration
reform
are
many
but
its
chances
of
it
happening
at
least
in
the
next
two
years
are
practically
nonexistent
douglas
rivlin
director
of
communication
of
the
national
immigration
forum
has
a
different
approach
maybe
we
cannot
get
the
big
enchilada
but
we
may
be
able
to
get
some
of
its
pieces
he
said
in
reference
to
the
dream
act
which
would
allow
immigrant
students
with
no
papers
to
apply
for
legal
status
as
long
as
they
are
attending
college
it
would
give
them
the
same
opportunity
if
they
joined
the
army
he
was
also
referring
to
the
agricultural
job
opportunities
benefits
and
security
act
or
agjobs
a
bill
that
would
allow
up
to
15
million
unauthorized
farm
workers
to
become
legal
immigrants
both
were
included
in
the
strive
act
and
went
down
in
flames
with
it
there
is
a
need
for
the
agricultural
workers
who
would
benefit
from
the
approval
of
agjobs
he
said
and
there
is
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
the
kids
which
should
bolster
the
passage
of
the
dream
act
but
for
them
to
pass
communities
have
to
keep
the
pressure
on
their
congresspeople
and
senators
rivlin
said
our
communities
are
here
to
stay
and
things
are
not
going
to
get
any
better
on
their
own
