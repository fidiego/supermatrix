while
health
care
reform
dominates
the
national
agenda
immigrant
rights
groups
are
mobilizing
a
campaign
to
put
immigration
reform
back
on
the
top
of
the
national
priority
list
responding
to
an
announcement
from
president
barack
obama
last
week
that
immigration
reform
would
be
put
off
until
at
least
2010
a
collaboration
of
asian
and
pacific
islander
organizations
near
historic
filipino
town
on
monday
kicked
off
a
week
of
activities
aimed
at
pressuring
federal
lawmakers
to
move
it
forward
filipinos
face
one
of
the
longest
average
waits
to
enter
the
us
up
to
22
years
to
continue
to
punt
immigration
reform
to
next
year
to
the
year
after
to
the
next
congress
just
doesnt
work
for
us
while
we
absolutely
want
health
care
reform
and
are
are
extremely
supportive
of
that
effort
we
cant
allow
immigration
reform
to
fall
by
the
wayside
said
sara
sadhwani
immigrant
rights
project
director
for
the
asian
pacific
american
legal
center
of
southern
california
apalc
immigrant
rights
advocates
have
been
galvanized
by
obamas
comment
in
mexico
last
week
that
immigration
reform
would
come
after
reforms
to
health
care
and
regulation
of
the
financial
sector
sadhwani
said
but
the
health
care
debate
and
fears
that
reform
would
bring
more
health
care
to
undocumented
immigrants
has
also
galvanized
groups
who
wish
to
close
the
national
doors
to
more
immigration
according
to
barbara
coe
founder
of
the
california
coalition
for
immigration
reform
which
despite
the
name
is
against
immigration
reform
if
our
efforts
are
successful
obama
will
push
immigration
reform
off
forever
she
said
we
dont
need
any
immigration
reform
all
we
need
is
our
current
laws
enforced
apalc
and
dozens
of
other
asian
and
pacific
islander
organizations
are
pushing
lawmakers
this
week
to
begin
work
on
immigration
reform
that
creates
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
immigrants
eliminates
the
backlog
of
visa
requests
and
halts
the
detention
and
deportation
of
undocumented
immigrants
they
have
also
turned
up
the
heat
on
the
already
highly
controversial
immigration
debate
by
including
rights
for
samesex
couples
in
their
desired
reforms
about
36000
samesex
binational
couples
live
in
the
united
states
and
those
in
which
one
of
the
partners
is
legal
but
the
other
is
not
are
not
allowed
to
apply
for
residency
the
way
heterosexual
couples
can
because
the
asian
pacific
islanders
call
for
immigration
reform
is
largely
based
on
family
reunification
samesex
immigration
reform
is
a
natural
fit
sadhwani
said
family
reunification
is
the
primary
reason
asians
and
pacific
islanders
come
to
the
united
states
and
though
a
path
to
citizenship
exists
for
most
family
members
of
us
citizens
and
green
card
holders
many
wait
for
years
in
their
home
countries
to
get
a
visa
according
to
the
apalc
lawmakers
would
be
smart
to
listen
to
the
api
demands
according
to
apalc
executive
director
stewart
kwoh
api
voters
account
for
about
10
percent
of
the
electorate
in
los
angeles
county
and
much
more
in
the
san
gabriel
valley
nationally
the
number
of
api
voters
increased
by
21
percent
from
28
million
in
2004
to
34
million
in
2008
and
its
not
just
the
asian
american
community
kwoh
said
we
are
united
with
the
latino
community
we
are
united
with
the
faith
community
we
are
united
with
the
business
community
