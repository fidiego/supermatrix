to
somebody
and
they

president
scott
stringer
showed
up
to
give
his
backing
to

can
we
he
said
explaining
how
he
now
offers
citizenship
application
assistance
from
his

each

this

has
been
great
to
get
a
lot
of
elected

and
communitybased
organizations
to
think
about
doing
this
on
their
own
you
can
see
the
people
who
are
answering
the
phones
feel
a
real
sense
of
satisfaction
some
volunteers
such
as
rafael

were
so
dedicated
they
had
to
be
reminded
to
break
for
lunch
dominguez
has
been
at
all
five
citizenship
now
phoneins
and
kept
alternating
between
the
spanish
and
english
phone
lines
i
just
dont
think
theres
anything
more
gratifying
than
this
dominguez
