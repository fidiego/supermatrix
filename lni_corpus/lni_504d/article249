associate
editor
mike
jones
then
shows
how
its
lost
peppering
his
editorial
with
loaded
references
to
the
antiimmigration
movement
anti
immigration
politicians
and
the
antiimmigration
factionspan
im
sure
there
are
people
who
oppose
all
immigration
but
i
havent
seen
any
reporting
on
these
people
constituting
a
movement
and
im
apparently
so
illinformed
that
i
cant
name
a
single
antiimmigration
politician
jones
and
hes
hardly
alone
takes
a
broader
view
however
counting
people
who
favor
traditional
legal
immigration
and
object
only
to
illegal
immigration
as
part
of
the
antiimmigration
movement
rhetoric
will
not
solve
immigrant
issue

this
makes
as
much
sense
as
referring
to
those
who
object
to
jaywalking
as
the
antiwalking
movement
the
antiimmigration
movement
is
nothing
but
a
gang
of
sinistersounding
rhetorical
straw
men
and
jones
and
the
world
know
it
if
they
really
want
to
clean
up
the
debate
and
rhetoric
on
this
issue
a
good
start
would
be
to
lose
the
term
antiimmigration
at
best
its
ambiguous
at
worst
