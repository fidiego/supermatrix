our

smooth

of

the

in
their
letter
the
committee
members
said
that
having
separated
immigration
enforcement
functions
from
immigration
service
functions
within
homeland
security
they
expect
that
each
mission
will
be
much
more
manageable
and
successfully
handled
than
when
they
were
together
in
the
ins
they
said
the
bureau
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
with
its
own
immigration
services
budget
and
independence
from
immigration
enforcement
should
excel
at
fairly
correctly
and
expeditiously
administering
immigration
benefits
we
urge
you
to
keep
this
committee
informed
about
this
critical
immigration
transition
into
dhs
they
said
immigration
services
and
enforcement
and
their
respective
programs
are
too
important
to
let
them
slip
through
the
cracks
while
dhs
gets
on
its
feet
feel
free
to
contact
this
committee
with
immigration
resource
needs
and
suggested
legislative
changes
we
look
forward
to
working
with
you
to
make
our
immigration
system
a
success
and
one
of
which
the
american
people
can
be
proud
they
said
mr
sensenbrenner
has
been
a
longtime
critic
of
ins
and
first
introduced
legislation
in
november
2001
after
the
september
11
attacks
to
restructure
the
agency
to
create
a
better
immigration
agency
with
clear
missions
more
accountability
and
clear
chains
of
command
at
the
time
he
described
ins
as
the
most
dysfunctional
agency
in
the
federal
government
adding
that
the
suicide
strikes
on
the
world
trade
center
and
the
pentagon
made
it
even
clearer
that
ins
presently
fails
both
immigrants
and
the
american
people
it
does
not
carry
out
its
law
enforcement
or
service
mission
well
that
legislation
would
have
created
within
the
justice
department
an
agency
for
immigration
affairs
headed
by
the
associate
attorney
general
for
immigration
affairs
with
two
bureaus
the
bureau
of
immigration
enforcement
and
the
bureau
of
immigration
services
and
adjudications
it
served
as
the
model
for
what
later
became
the
department
of
homeland
security
