national
trend

continues
an
upswing

the

showed
a

effort
by

to
track
down

had
been
ordered
deported
by
an
immigration
judge

to
four
this
year
those
who
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
say
any

immigration
is
welcome
but
they
want
to
see
higher
arrest
figures
given
a
halfmillion
illegals
in
new
jersey
2000
is
not
a
huge
number
whether
theyve
doubled
it
or
not
said
charles
nussman
a
westwood
resident
and
member
of
united
patriots
of
america
if
youre
talking
about
a
percentage
thats
20
percent
of
the
whole
population
of
illegals
then
thats
something
to
be
proud
of
but
this
is
less
than
1
percent
