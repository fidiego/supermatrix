washington
every
other
week
between
april
and
midnovember
an
odd
mixture
of
interest
groups
met
in
washington
to
plot
strategy
on
how
to
defeat
congressional
proposals
to
overhaul
the
countrys
immigration
policy
dubbed
the
leftright
coalition
on
immigration
by
one
of
the
participants
it
contained
organizations
that
seldom
see
eye
to
eye
on
anything
and
indeed
are
often
barely
on
speaking
terms
among
those
in
the
meetings
the
institute
for
justice
a
conservative
civil
rights
group
that
strongly
opposes
affirmative
action
americans
for
tax
reform
an
antitax
antibig
government
group
the
home
school
network
a
christian
fundamentalist
group
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
national
council
of
la
raza
and
the
national
immigration
forum
both
of
which
oppose
attempts
to
scale
back
legal
immigration
ive
been
in
a
meeting
where
an
aclu
guy
the
national
immigration
person
and
cato
guy
have
all
come
in
here
to
talk
about
strategy
at
the
same
time
said
an
aide
to
senator
spencer
abraham
a
michigan
republican
ive
never
seen
that
before
get
used
to
it
on
the
matter
of
the
countrys
immigration
laws
the
issues
are
large
the
proposals
complex
and
the
bedfellows
strange
this
issue
puts
patrick
j
buchanan
the
conservative
commentator
and
republican
presidential
candidate
and
senator
dianne
feinstein
the
california
democrat
on
one
side
favoring
more
limits
while
the
other
side
claims
representative
robert
k
dornan
the
gaybashing
california
republican
and
representative
barney
frank
the
massachusetts
democrat
who
is
openly
homosexual
the
prominent
conservative
republicans
william
bennett
and
jack
kemp
are
strongly
proimmigration
while
barbara
jordan
the
famously
liberal
former
democratic
congresswomen
from
texas
chaired
a
national
commission
that
recommended
cutting
legal
immigration
by
onethird
a
proposal
that
was
endorsed
by
president
clinton
immigration
is
like
that
it
is
an
issue
so
visceral
and
its
impact
so
geographically
uneven
that
it
tends
to
blur
traditional
party
and
ideological
lines
the
label
liberal
has
usually
embraced
environmentalist
causes
for
example
but
now
some
environmentalists
have
emerged
as
a
major
force
behind
the
antiimmigration
coalition
among
conservatives
the
immigration
issue
has
highlighted
the
reemergence
of
old
divisions
between
isolationists
now
resurgent
with
the
fall
of
communism
and
freemarket
internationalists
its
a
mistake
to
think
liberals
are
proimmigration
and
conservatives
are
antiimmigration
said
sanford
j
ungar
dean
of
american
universitys
school
of
communication
and
author
of
fresh
blood
the
new
american
immigrant
simon
and
schuster
thats
a
common
mistake
made
in
the
current
debate
of
course
the
debate
summons
concerns
that
are
predictable
even
if
they
cut
against
traditional
loyalties
some
of
the
liberal
politicians
who
want
immigration
slowed
for
example
are
from
states
like
california
and
florida
where
a
surge
of
immigrants
has
led
to
a
backlash
that
politicians
ignore
at
their
peril
also
some
of
the
proposals
being
bandied
about
in
congress
are
so
sweeping
that
they
contain
some
provisions
that
are
bound
to
provoke
someone
for
example
christian
fundamentalists
assert
that
the
proposal
to
end
or
restrict
immigration
preferences
for
parents
and
siblings
of
american
citizens
is
antifamily
the
aclu
and
the
national
rifle
association
object
from
opposite
political
poles
to
a
proposal
by
senator
feinstein
for
a
national
identification
card
that
contains
a
persons
photograph
and
other
identifying
features
like
fingerprints
the
nra
position
is
simple
said
grover
norquist
executive
director
of
americans
for
tax
reform
who
has
been
a
leader
in
galvanizing
conservative
opposition
to
many
of
the
proposals
if
youre
going
to
register
people
why
not
guns
some
students
of
congress
say
the
weird
concoctions
of
allies
in
the
immigration
debate
is
an
outgrowth
of
a
trend
in
congress
to
produce
more
and
more
omnibus
bills
sweeping
pieces
of
legislation
that
are
an
amalgam
of
nearly
every
proposal
under
the
sun
omnibus
bills
have
been
the
preferred
way
to
deal
with
other
issues
like
crime
and
health
care
devised
as
a
means
to
win
support
from
different
lawmakers
by
incorporating
many
pet
proposals
the
omnibus
bills
can
become
a
lightning
rod
for
disparate
interest
groups
seeking
to
deepsix
them
for
those
who
want
to
know
where
the
players
tend
to
line
up
on
immigration
here
is
an
ideological
scorecard
that
might
help
free
marketeers
to
them
the
debate
over
immigration
is
a
reprise
of
recent
legislative
battles
over
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
they
believe
that
the
free
flow
of
people
across
national
borders
like
that
of
goods
and
capital
leads
to
prosperity
major
proponents
house
majority
leader
dick
armey
of
texas
the
wall
street
journal
editorial
board
nativists
they
believe
that
the
current
levels
of
immigration
which
since
the
immigration
act
of
1965
has
been
dominated
by
people
from
asia
and
latin
america
pose
a
threat
to
the
anglosaxon
part
of
americas
culture
some
major
proponents
mr
buchanan
and
the
national
review
civil
rights
and
ethnic
advocates
immigration
is
to
them
a
human
rights
issue
they
view
hostility
to
immigration
as
racist
major
proponents
the
national
council
of
la
raza
the
national
immigration
forum
and
various
asianamerican
organizations
environmentalists
and
population
control
advocates
many
of
these
groups
believe
that
the
immigrationfueled
increase
in
the
united
states
population
portends
an
overcrowded
america
unable
to
preserve
its
environment
and
its
quality
of
life
major
proponents
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
and
the
carrying
capacity
network
which
advocates
population
control
job
protectionists
concerned
about
income
stagnation
among
american
workers
and
declines
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
they
believe
that
immigration
both
legal
and
illegal
depresses
wages
and
takes
jobs
from
unskilled
americans
major
proponents
some
labor
unions
and
the
usually
liberal
writer
michael
lind
antigovernment
libertarians
they
are
skeptical
of
large
government
programs
such
as
a
national
identification
card
or
a
requirement
that
employers
check
with
a
national
registry
of
social
security
numbers
or
alien
registration
documents
before
hiring
major
proponents
the
conservative
cato
institute
the
aclu
antitax
advocates
and
selected
businesses
they
are
incensed
over
provisions
requiring
employers
to
pay
a
tax
on
every
foreign
worker
they
sponsor
major
