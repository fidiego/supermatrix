frustrated
by
the
lack
of
progress
on
immigration
reform
area
latino
democrats
are
forming
a
new
group
to
pressure
the
obama
administration
to
take
action
on
the
issue
latino
democratic
politicians
and
community
activists
who
voted
for
president
barack
obama
say
he
has
failed
to
fulfill
a
campaign
pledge
to
overhaul
immigration
laws
its
way
overdue
said
gil
navarro
a
member
of
the
san
bernardino
county
board
of
education
that
was
one
of
the
promises
the
president
gave
us
and
we
want
to
hold
him
accountable
like
any
other
public
official
navarro
is
creating
a
latino
democratic
caucus
of
the
inland
empire
a
group
chartered
by
the
county
democratic
party
that
will
focus
on
immigration
and
other
issues
of
concern
to
latinos
navarro
is
in
the
process
of
filing
paperwork
to
make
the
group
official
a
lot
of
our
relatives
that
have
come
to
this
country
illegally
are
looking
to
share
in
the
american
dream
he
said
even
though
theyre
not
here
legally
they
still
pay
taxes
if
we
dont
want
more
people
coming
here
illegally
from
other
countries
we
need
to
fix
the
problem
mel
albiso
a
board
member
for
the
colton
joint
unified
school
district
plans
to
join
the
group
theres
no
attention
being
paid
to
the
topic
of
immigration
no
discussion
no
dialogue
albiso
said
all
the
time
that
goes
by
people
and
families
are
suffering
its
up
to
us
to
bring
the
topic
to
the
forefront
and
put
the
political
pressure
where
it
needs
to
be
placed
there
is
some
debate
about
how
closely
the
views
of
latino
activist
groups
and
democratic
lawmakers
reflect
the
opinions
of
typical
latino
voters
last
week
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
nonpartisan
think
tank
that
supports
reduced
immigration
levels
released
a
zogby
survey
of
about
1500
latino
black
and
asianamerican
likely
voters
most
members
of
the
three
groups
want
the
law
enforced
and
illegal
immigrants
to
return
to
their
home
countries
overall
they
also
feel
that
the
current
level
of
immigration
is
too
high
the
survey
found
the
leadership
of
the
hispanic
community
is
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
an
amnesty
and
increased
legal
immigration
said
steven
camarota
the
centers
director
of
research
when
you
survey
hispanic
voters
you
get
a
more
complicated
picture
in
general
theyre
much
more
proenforcement
than
is
the
leadership
of
organizations
that
claim
to
speak
for
hispanics
obama
received
about
twothirds
of
the
nearly
10
million
votes
cast
by
latinos
in
the
november
2008
election
during
the
campaign
he
said
he
would
act
on
immigration
reform
in
his
first
year
in
office
but
immigration
has
been
pushed
to
the
sidelines
as
obama
has
struggled
to
turn
around
the
economy
and
overhaul
the
health
care
system
some
latino
democrats
are
willing
to
give
obama
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
now
we
have
to
give
him
time
said
lynda
gonzalez
a
48yearold
mexicanamerican
who
lives
in
bloomington
there
are
multiple
problems
out
there
people
are
losing
their
jobs
and
their
homes
to
me
thats
more
important
rep
joe
baca
dsan
bernardino
said
immigration
reform
must
take
a
backseat
to
more
pressing
problems
of
course
i
would
have
liked
to
see
congress
and
the
president
make
more
serious
legislative
progress
towards
comprehensive
immigration
reform
baca
said
in
a
statement
but
right
now
creating
jobs
and
fixing
our
broken
health
insurance
system
must
be
our
top
priorities
baca
who
cosponsored
a
bill
that
includes
a
path
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
said
he
remains
very
confident
obama
will
move
forward
on
immigration
reform
once
the
health
care
issue
is
solved
carol
robb
chairwoman
of
the
county
democratic
party
conceded
that
getting
republicans
to
agree
to
comprehensive
immigration
reform
will
be
a
challenge
republicans
will
probably
hold
their
breath
and
threaten
to
turn
blue
robb
said
im
not
saying
its
going
to
be
easy
but
its
doable
jose
zapata
calderon
a
professor
of
sociology
and
chicano
studies
at
pitzer
college
in
claremont
said
obama
has
expanded
the
hardline
immigration
policies
of
the
bush
administration
workplace
raids
and
deportations
of
illegal
immigrants
have
increased
since
obama
took
office
calderon
said
those
of
us
who
worked
on
the
campaign
are
somewhat
taken
aback
calderon
said
unfortunately
whats
happening
is
were
not
seeing
anything
but
enforcement
if
that
continues
well
see
a
rapid
erosion
of
support
in
the
latino
community
and
other
communities
area
latino
republicans
are
concerned
about
the
cost
of
illegal
immigration
joe
martinez
a
board
member
for
the
rialto
unified
school
district
considers
himself
a
fiscally
conservative
republican
who
believes
the
nations
immigration
laws
must
be
enforced
those
here
illegally
should
take
the
call
against
illegal
immigration
as
a
warning
bell
martinez
said
anyone
who
is
serious
about
staying
here
should
become
a
naturalized
citizen
to
protect
themselves
and
the
future
of
their
families
they
need
to
take
action
before
washington
and
sacramento
ask
themselves
the
hard
question
of
how
long
we
can
continue
to
support
those
here
illegally
robert
rego
chairman
of
the
county
republican
party
said
the
gops
position
on
immigration
must
be
about
more
than
enforcement
we
must
come
up
with
a
comprehensive
plan
to
deal
with
the
issue
in
a
way
thats
beneficial
to
the
country
as
a
whole
rego
said
camarota
the
director
of
research
at
the
center
for
immigration
studies
said
latino
activists
will
make
a
lot
of
noise
but
he
doesnt
think
it
will
matter
will
obama
pay
any
political
price
for
his
failure
to
bring
up
immigration
this
year
no
because
its
not
a
top
priority
for
actual
hispanic
voters
he
said
democrats
are
feeling
really
vulnerable
they
dont
want
to
do
anything
to
further
alienate
middleoftheroad
voters
amnesties
generally
do
