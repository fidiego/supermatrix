jerry
brown
signed
a
slate
of
immigrationrelated
bills
saturday
including
the
trust
act
which
limits
local
law
enforcement
agencies
use
of
federal
holds
on
undocumented
immigrants
booked
into
local
jails
the
bill
ab
4
by
assemblyman
tom
ammiano
dsan
francisco
prohibits
local
police
agencies
from
holding
individuals
on
federal
immigration
detainers
unless
they
are
charged
with
or
convicted
of
a
serious
felony
or
certain
misdemeanors
or
if
they
are
registered
sex
offenders
it
creates
a
statewide
standard
for
how
local
agencies
comply
with
the
federal
secure
communities
program
soon
immigrant
californians
and
their
family
members
will
have
the
confidence
that
minor
or
unjustified
arrests
for
things
like
selling
food
without
a
permit
or
having
dogs
that
bark
too
loudly
will
not
lead
to
extended
and
costly
detentions
in
our
local
jails
for
deportation
purposes
said
reshma
shamasunder
executive
director
of
the
california
immigrant
policy
center
brown
vetoed
a
similar
bill
a
year
ago
but
this
years
bill
was
amended
to
increase
the
list
of
crimes
that
would
keep
immigrants
in
jail
until
federal
immigration
officials
could
take
custody
immigration
advocates
have
long
argued
that
immigration
holds
used
in
conjunction
with
the
federal
secure
communities
program
often
ensnare
us
citizens
legal
immigrants
and
undocumented
immigrants
jailed
for
minor
offenses
or
charges
that
later
are
dropped
its
incredible
when
the
rest
of
the
country
is
falling
behind
on
immigration
reform
california
is
taking
the
lead
said
jesus
guzman
a
local
immigration
advocate
who
first
heard
the
news
on
twitter
sonoma
county
sheriff
steve
freitas
has
been
a
staunch
opponent
of
the
bill
freitas
said
that
if
signed
into
law
the
bill
would
force
him
to
choose
between
violating
the
new
state
law
or
federal
rules
which
require
local
law
enforcement
officials
to
honor
immigration
detainers
last
year
freitas
told
local
supporters
of
the
bill
that
he
would
challenge
the
new
law
in
court
but
in
early
september
freitas
said
publicly
that
while
he
still
opposes
the
bill
he
would
not
spend
county
resources
fighting
it
in
court
representatives
from
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
were
unavailable

call
for
congress
to
adopt
a
comprehensive
bill
that
would
deal
fairly
with
the
estimated
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
living
in
the
united
states
last
week
brown
signed
a
bill
that
would
require
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
to
issue
special
drivers
licenses
to
undocumented
immigrants
reversing
a
20year
old
law
that
has
landed
many
undocumented
immigrants
in
jail
for
driving
infractions
