provides
a
forum
for
presentations

discussions
on
various
aspects
of
this
complex
issue

the
immigration
status
of
residents
who
are
currently
undocumented
understanding
the
impacts

border

interior
enforcement

developing
policies
that
address
future
immigration
or
future
flows
and
the
root
causes
of
migration
our
goal
is
also
to
increase
our
own
understanding
of
this
important
issue

contribute
to
the
national
debate
in
ways
that
promote
the
