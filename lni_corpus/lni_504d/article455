today
will
introduce
a
bill
to
further
provide
resources
to
help
gain
operational
control
over
the
borders
of
the
united
states
enforce
and
strengthen
interior
immigration
laws
and
create
additional
penalties
for
immigration
violations
the
bill
contains
some
72
separate
provisions
which
represent
the
ideas
and
insights
of
numerous
members
of
congress
a
variety
of
federal
and
state
agencies
affected
by
illegal
immigration
stakeholders
and
members
of
the
public
some
of
these
provisions
represent
compromise
positions
adopted
by
senators
in
the
last
immigration
bill
and
others
contain
tough
new
enforcement
provisions
the
debate
we
had
a
few
weeks
ago
on
immigration
reform
should
not
deter
congress
from
doing
what
is
still
needed
to
secure
our
borders
and
reduce
illegal
immigration
said
kyl
we
should
take
what
we
learned
from
that
debate
that
the
american
people
want
enforcement
and
put
it
into
workable
legislation
thats
exactly
what
weve
done
here
on
the
whole
the
legislation
distills
many
of
the
lessons
that
we
learned
discussing
immigration
reform
in
the
senate
each
of
the
provisions
contained
in
this
bill
can
stand
alone
on
its
own
merit
or
be
combined
with
any
other
immigration
bill
introduction
of
this
bill
is
consistent
with
what
the
american
people
are
asking
us
to
do
said
sessions
the
bill
requires
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
complete
construction
of
the
full
700
miles
of
southern
border
fencing
improve
cooperation
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
and
increase
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
at
the
workplace
these
are
important
steps
toward
creating
a
lawful
system
of
immigration
the
failure
of
the
senate
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
was
a
huge
disappointment
said
kyl
although
we
must
move
forward
with
other
issues
we
can
show
the
american
people
that
we
are
serious
about
securing
our
nations
border
this
bill
highlights
the
steps
that
need
to
be
taken
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
our
national
security
and
immigration
system
and
would
provide
an
essential
step
toward
achieving
comprehensive
reform
in
the
future
our
legislation
streamlines
deportation
proceedings
provides
robust
border
and
visa
controls
and
makes
available
to
local
and
federal
law
enforcement
more
tools
to
aggressively
deal
with
illegal
immigration
said
graham
our
immigration
system
is
structurally
flawed
there
remain
at
least
half
a
dozen
major
changes
in
policy
our
nation
must
address
to
get
the
problems
of
illegal
immigration
under
control
this
is
another
step
forward
in
that
endeavor
the
bill
would
authorize
significant
increases
in
the
number
of
personnel
to
patrol
the
border
staff
the
ports
of
entry
prevent
smuggling
and
investigate
immigration
violations
it
would
also
increase
the
amount
of
fencing
vehicle
barriers
physical
infrastructure
and
technology
to
observe
and
deter
illegal
crossings
and
the
amount
of
detention
space
to
hold
unlawful
aliens
the
bill
would
also
mandate
that
dhs
detain
unlawful
aliens
crossing
the
border
until
those
aliens
are
removed
it
would
require
that
dhs
capture
biometric
data
on
all
foreign
nationals
legally
entering
and
departing
the
united
states
and
identify
track
detain
and
remove
those
who
overstay
their
visas
the
bill
would
authorize
significant
increases
in
personnel
for
dhs
and
the
department
of
justice
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
in
the
interior
of
the
united
states
it
would
add
new
legal
authorities
to
prevent
the
entry
and
enable
the
removal
of
suspected
terrorists
aggravated
felons
gang
members
human
smugglers
and
other
criminals
the
bill
would
add
new
legal
authorities
to
deter
and
prosecute
crimes
against
children
to
combat
smuggling
and
to
prevent
fraud
it
would
also
enhance
the
ability
of
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
identify
unlawful
aliens
and
increase
funding
to
states
adversely
affected
by
illegal
immigration
the
bill
would
enhance
laws
to
prevent
the
hiring
of
unlawful
aliens
in
the
united
states
it
would
require
dhs
to
establish
an
employment
verification
system
that
would
make
it
easier
to
identify
unauthorized
workers
in
part
through
enhanced
datasharing
between
federal
and
state
agencies
the
bill
would
increase
the
security
and
integrity
of
social
security
cards
and
provide
funding
to
assist
states
in
issuing
more
secure
drivers
licenses
and
identity
documents
the
bill
would
increase
civil
and
criminal
penalties
against
employers
who
knowingly
hire
unlawful
aliens
and
persons
who
misuse
identity
documents
