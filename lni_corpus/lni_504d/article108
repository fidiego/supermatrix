if
south
carolinas
aggressive
new
immigration
law
takes
effect
next
year
as
scheduled
the
controversial
measure
could
clog
the
charlotte
immigration
court
with
deportation
cases
and
lead
to
a
spike
in
business
at
law
practices
throughout
the
carolinas
modeled
after
legislation
in
arizona
the
immigration
crackdown
would
allow
police
to
rely
on
reasonable
suspicion
when
asking
for
proof
of
citizenship
or
legal
residence
during
any
kind
of
stop
investigation
or
arrest
the
law
also
establishes
an
illegal
immigration
enforcement
unit
and
requires
employers
to
use
the
federal
everify
system
to
check
whether
employees
and
job
applicants
are
legal
residents
gov

signed
the
immigration
law
sb

in
late
june
and
while
it
is
slated
to
become
effective
jan
1
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
vowed
to
file
suit
to
halt
the
measure
said
victoria
middleton
executive
director
of
aclu
of
south
carolina
she
argues
that
the
law
promotes
racial
profiling
and
is
trumped
by
federal
authority
the
aclu
has
made
similar
contentions
in
pending
lawsuits
against
strict
immigration
laws
in
alabama
arizona
and
georgia
weve
gotten
preliminary
injunctions
in
arizona
and
georgia
middleton
said
its
our
goal
to
have
the
preliminary
injunction
filed
in
south
carolina
before
the
laws
january
start
date
while
south
carolinas
law
is
months
away
from
taking
effect
and
its
future
is
uncertain
some
immigration
lawyers
have
already
noticed
a
significant
uptick
in
new
clients
who
are
anxious
about
being
deported
it
has
definitely
increased
business
said
marco
t
torres
an
immigration
attorney
at
the
torres
law
firm
in
charleston
ive
seen
a
lot
more
people
seeking
consultation
robert
j
lowe
jr
of
charlestons
lowe
associates
also
reports
a
growing
client
list
as
a
result
of
the
pending
immigration
crackdown
so
far
he
has
had
limited
success
in
helping
mexican
and
honduran
clients
obtain
citizenship
through
asylum
theres
no
question
that
many
of
these
people
are
going
to
be
persecuted
when
they
go
back
to
their
home
countries
he
said
and
were
seeing
some
reluctance
in
federal
court
to
put
these
people
in
harms
way
if
an
immigrant
has
no
legal
standing
to
be
in
the
country
theres
not
much
an
attorney
can
do
for
them
said
zachary
s
naert
a
solo
practitioner
in
mount
pleasant
who
previously
worked
for
a
nonprofit
organization
that
protects
the
rights
of
migrant
farm
workers
but
naert
has
found
that
many
immigrants
often
have
at
least
a
possible
legal
basis
to
be
in
the
country
such
as
citizenship
through
marriage
or
a
family
member
and
are
unaware
of
their
rights
a
lot
of
people
dont
know
he
said
or
if
they
do
know
they
still
might
not
have
done
anything
about
it
because
theyre
scared
of
attorneys
afraid
of
the
system
in
general
or
dont
have
enough
money
to
go
through
the
process
bogged
down
while
the
threat
of
the
new
law
is
spurring
some
immigrants
to
seek
out
legal
advice
others
are
packing
up
and
leaving
south
carolina
for
states
that
have
more
lenient
laws
many
of
them
are
expected
to
head
to
north
carolina
where
immigration
attorneys
are
more
plentiful
and
where
police
are
not
required
to
check
a
persons
immigration
status
based
on
suspicion
the
south
carolina
attorneys
will
feel
the
initial
impact
but
it
will
eventually
come
up
to
us
because
there
arent
that
many
immigration
attorneys
in
south
carolina
said
charlotte
immigration
lawyer
cynthia
a
aziz
of
the
aziz
law
firm
aziz
added
that
lawyers
in
the
mecklenburg
area
may
also
get
more
clients
as
a
matter
of
convenience
because
they
are
closer
to
the
us
immigration
court
in
charlotte
which
serves
north
and
south
carolina
all
undocumented
immigrants
who
are
arrested
in
the
carolinas
and
have
their
cases
reviewed
by
a
judge
end
up
in
the
charlotte
court
aziz
who
has
practiced
immigration
law
for
more
than
20
years
expects
that
south
carolinas
crackdown
will
spark
a
surge
of
deportation
cases
because
it
allows
police
to
make
immigration
arrests
based
on
minor
violations
such
as
jaywalking
or
driving
with
a
broken
headlight
and
the
immigration
court
could
be
overwhelmed
she
said
the
court
only
has
three
judges
in
charlotte
and
theyre
already
thinly
stretched
she
said
so
now
theyre
going
to
have
to
process
more
and
more
cases
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
greater
backlog
lowe
the
charleston
immigration
lawyer
also
expects
that
daytoday
operations
will
slow
down
in
immigration
court
because
a
skeletal
crew
is
running
everything
and
theyre
so
bogged
down
that
they
cant
deal
with
the
current
system
a
spokesman
for
the
us
department
of
justice
which
oversees
the
immigration
court
declined
comment
strained
resources
legal
services
of
southern
piedmont
in
charlotte
relies
on
volunteer
attorneys
to
help
immigrants
navigate
the
court
system
those
lawyers
meet
oneonone
with
defendants
outside
court
and
take
a
few
minutes
to
explain
their
rights
and
what
might
happen
next
they
also
try
to
combat
the
notarios
people
who
masquerade
as
legal
consultants
and
prey
on
immigrant
communities
the
unscrupulous
and
unlicensed
consultants
collect
thousands
of
dollars
in
fees
from
immigrants
who
are
facing
deportation
and
then
typically
botch
their
paperwork
and
skip
important
court
hearings
the
new
immigration
law
could
exacerbate
the
already
widespread
abuse
by
notarios
by
providing
the
scammers
with
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
new
victims
said
legal
services
of
southern
piedmont
project
coordinator
danielle
h
lombard
when
the
population
of
vulnerable
people
rises
then
its
likely
to
expect
that
those
who
take
advantage
of
them
would
also
proliferate
she
said
legal
services
of
southern
piedmont
has
22
pro
bono
immigration
lawyers
who
meet
with
up
to
50
immigrant
defendants
every
week
and
theyre
only
getting
busier
lombard
said
she
expects
that
the
need
for
legal
services
will
grow
as
more
immigrants
are
funneled
into
court
we
really
need
more
attorneys
to
become
experienced
at
practicing
removal
defense
and
who
are
willing
to
help
us
provide
this
type
of
legal
assistance
which
is
so
necessary
she
said
the
carolinas
have
a
shortage
of
immigration
attorneys
because
the
region
lacked
its
own
immigration
court
for
so
long
lombard
said
before
the
charlotte
court
opened
in
2008
immigration
lawyers
in
the
carolinas
had
to
travel
to
courts
in
either
georgia
or
virginia
to
represent
clients
in
deportation
proceedings
a
major
expense
and
a
disincentive
to
represent
them
if
every
single
immigrant
who
had
some
legal
form
of
relief
actually
had
the
money
to
pay
an
attorney
in
north
or
south
carolina
there
would
not
be
enough
attorneys
there
for
them
to
find
one
lombard
said
now
with
the
change
of
the
laws
in
south
carolina
the
clock
is
ticking
for
everyone
who
has
some
form
of
relief
and
doesnt
get
an
attorney
time
is
also
running
out
for
legal
services
of
southern
piedmont
the
programs
bank
account
is
nearly
empty
and
it
may
go
under
before
the
new
immigration
law
goes
into
effect
in
fact
the
program
barely
has
enough
money
to
stay
afloat
through
august
lombard
said
were
trying
to
raise
enough
money
to
keep
it
going
she
said
i
hope
that
were
still
here
because
it
sounds
like
the
need
is
even
more
desperate
