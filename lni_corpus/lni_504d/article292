andrew
parker
sighed
when
he
heard
he
would
be
running
against
a
strident
antiillegal
immigration
candidate
parker
seeking
the
republican
nomination
for
state
house
district
33
in
west
valley
city
knows
illegal
immigration
is
a
hotbutton
issue
with
delegates
but
hed
rather
focus
on
what
he
sees
as
more
important
issues
such
as
education
and
economic
development
parker
said
he
disagrees
with
antiillegal
immigration
activist
alex
segura
however
a
new
public
opinion
poll
suggests
that
most
utahns
would
support
a
candidate
who
wants
to
get
tough
on
immigration
some
68
percent
of
utahns
said
they
would
vote
for
a
candidate
whose
platform
includes
immigration
measures
such
as
repealing
a
law
allowing
some
undocumented
students
to
pay
instate
tuition
according
to
a
deseret
morning
newsksltv
statewide
poll
of
627
adults
the
survey
was
conducted
march
2730
by
dan
jones
associates
as
the
us
senate
debated
several
immigration
reform
proposals
and
as
hundreds
of
students
in
utah
and
thousands
across
the
country
walked
out
of
class
in
protest
the
poll
has
a
margin
of
error
of
4
percent
archie
archuleta
chairman
of
the
utah
coalition
of
la
raza
said
this
election
season
has
the
potential
to
be
disastrous
for
immigrant
rights
archuleta
said
he
hopes
that
sensible
im
migration
reform
by
congress
can
curb
what
he
sees
as
growing
antiimmigrant
sentiment
this
election
year
is
going
to
be
a
real
test
of
where
were
headed
as
this
antiimmigration
wave
is
getting
stronger
archuleta
said
the
trend
of
the
nation
has
been
to
the
right
on
immigration
issues
while
the
issue
has
nationally
been
a
divisive
one
for
republicans
the
poll
suggested
that
in
utah
democrats
are
more
divided
on
the
issue
than
republicans
among
those
who
said
they
were
democrats
26
percent
said
they
would
definitely
vote
for
gettough
candidates
compared
to
16
percent
who
said
they
would
definitely
vote
against
such
candidates
the
split
among
republicans
was
44
percent
to
5
percent
those
who
said
they
are
very
conservative
were
the
most
likely
to
say
theyd
definitely
vote
for
a
gettough
immigration
candidate
the
results
arent
that
surprising
since
they
illustrate
the
nature
of
utahs
republican
party
which
tends
to
reflect
the
partys
conservative
branch
nationally
said
kelly
patterson
director
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
elections
and
democracy
at
brigham
young
university
however
utahs
lawmakers
are
closely
split
on
the
immigration
issue
in
the
last
days
of
the
recent
legislative
session
representatives
voted
3534
to
keep
the
house
from
debating
hb7
which
would
have
repealed
the
tuition
law
i
think
immigration
is
still
one
of
those
issues
that
people
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
politically
what
it
means
and
what
to
do
patterson
said
you
have
a
conservative
part
of
a
party
that
really
knows
what
it
wants
to
do
and
a
moderate
wing
of
the
party
thats
not
quite
sure
yet
rep
glenn
donnelson
rnorth
ogden
who
is
running
for
reelection
sponsored
hb7
and
other
failed
bills
aimed
at
clamping
down
on
illegal
immigration
immigration
is
increasingly
becoming
an
issue
in
campaigns
across
the
state
as
candidates
looking
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
enter
the
political
arena
the
republicans
vying
to
unseat
rep
neal
hendrickson
dwest
valley
in
district
33
represent
diverse
viewpoints
on
immigration
parker
disagrees
with
seguras
tough
stand
on
illegal
immigration
the
other
republican
in
the
race
pete
moesser
would
like
to
see
lawmakers
take
a
tougher
stand
on
some
immigration
issues
i
cant
personally
blame
them
for
wanting
to
come
here
moesser
said
we
offer
them
all
sorts
of
candy
and
there
isnt
any
consequences

councilman
stephen
sandstrom
a
member
of
utahns
for
immigration
reform
and
enforcement
is
running
against
rep
james
ferrin
rorem
in
part
because
of
immigration
i
think
hes
failed
on
immigration
sandstrom
said
it
really
doesnt
have
to
be
a
federal
issue
theres
a
lot
we
can
do
as
a
state
i
call
it
political
cowardliness
ferrin
voted
in
favor
of
hb7
in
the
education
committee
but
was
among
lawmakers
who
held
a
substitute
version
from
a
vote
it
was
the
last
night
for
house
bills
to
be
heard
ferrin
said
we
had
a
full
calendar
and
i
didnt
support
the
the
substitute
version
which
would
have
grandfathered
in
undocumented
students
already
attending
school
and
jerry
owens
a
member
of
the
antiimmigration
minutemen
group
says
hes
running
as
a
constitution
party
candidate
in
large
part
because
rep
dave
ure
sponsored
the
tuition
bill
and
worked
to
keep
the
repeal
from
a
debate
owens
and
ure
are
among
several
candidates
vying
for
the
vacant
senate
district
26
seat
i
know
that
the
pressure
for
repealing
that
bill
is
growing
by
the
day
ure
said
i
suppose
it
will
become
part
of
the
election
platform
for
or
against
me
it
is
still
something
im
willing
to
speak
