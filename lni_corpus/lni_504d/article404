at
a
us
information
agency
foreign
press
center
briefing
in
washington
yesterday
we
are
operating
on
three
basic
premises
the
first
premise
being
that
the
best
protection
of
our
legal
immigration
processes
and
policies
is
one
that
builds
public
confidence
in
a
system
for
the
immigration
into
the
united
states
that
works
the
second
is
that
the
best
strategy
to
build
that
public
confidence
and
our
best
protection
against
illegal
immigration
is
an
enforcement
program
that
works
until
it
is
understood
that
if
you
attempt
to
enter
illegally
you
will
be
stopped
until
it
is
understood
that
if
you
are
here
illegally
you
will
be
found
and
processed
for
removal
until
it
is
understood
that
if
you
have
exhausted
your
opportunity
for
consideration
under
the
law
you
will
be
removed
we
will
not
achieve
the
fundamental
objective
of
public
confidence
in
the
immigration
system
which
we
hope
will
then
guarantee
our
commitment
to
legal
immigration
nor
will
we
in
fact
deter
entry
by
demonstrating
that
illegal
entry
or
illegal
remaining
is
in
fact
not
an
achievable
opportunity
finally
we
are
operating
on
a
premise
that
there
is
indeed
a
shared
responsibility
between
the
federal
government
whose
principle
objective
is
to
run
this
immigration
system
and
local
governments
who
bear
the
cost
of
illegal
immigration
and
consequently
the
administration
has
proposed
to
share
the
cost
of
illegal
immigration
through
revenue
sharing
at
the
federal
level
the
budget
proposes
investments
of
12
billion
in
the
immigration
system
half
of
those
investments
are
in
fact
to
reimburse
states
for
their
costs
of
illegal
immigration
