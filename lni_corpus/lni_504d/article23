length

words
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
united
states
congress
can
muster
the
responsibility
and
will
to
do
what
is
right
and
achieve
comprehensive
immigration
reform
this
year
republican
leadership
in
the
house
of
representatives
continues
to
hold
immigration
reform
hostage
most
recently
justifying
inaction
by
blaming
president
obamas
alleged
track
record
on
failing
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
perhaps
those
in
congress
should
come
and
sit
inside
the
many
immigration
courtrooms
throughout
the
country
for
a
fact
check
on
this
unfounded
assertion
in
my
31
years
as
a
united
states
immigration
judge
i
have
never
had
as
many
people
come
through
my
courtroom
as
i
have
over
the
past
six
years
the
detained
number
of
individuals
appearing
in
immigration
courts
today
is
unprecedented
the
administration
has
indisputably
increased
immigration
enforcement
in
communities
across
the
country
partnering
with
local
law
enforcement
to
pursue
an
aggressive
deportation
program
that
has
resulted
in
nearly
2
million
deportations
since
2008
as
these
men
and
women
came
through
my
courtroom
in
baltimore
i
was
extremely
limited
in
my
ability
to
consider
each
case
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
they
should
remain
in
the
country
or
be
deported
coming
to
the
best
decision
for
each
individual
in
a
very
limited
amount
of
time
can
hardly
be
seen
as
justice
and
for
noncitizens
who
have
been
living
in
this
country
for
years
or
even
a
lifetime
the
system
can
even
be
crueler
consider
the
case
of
lundy
khoy
who
came
to
the
united
states
at
the
age
of
1
with
her
parents
fleeing
genocide
in
cambodia
upon
arrival
they
were
granted
refugee
status
and
then
legal
permanent
residence
lundy
grew
up
as
many
american
children
do
going
to
school
playing
sports
and
preparing
for
college
while
a
college
student
in
2000
lundy
was
arrested
for
possession
of
several
pills
of
ecstasy
and
at
her
lawyers
advice
pleaded
guilty
and
spent
three
months
in
jail
she
was
released
early
for
good
behavior
moved
back
in
with
her
parents
resumed
her
studies
and
worked
hard
to
make
up
for
the
time
lost
at
the
end
of
her
fouryear
probation
period
she
met
with
her
probation
officers
to
proudly
show
off
her
grades
only
to
be
met
by
immigration
officials
who
to
her
surprise
sent
her
to
a
county
jail
where
she
was
held
for
nine
months
after
being
released
she
again
worked
to
put
her
life
on
track
but
in
2012
she
was
told
that
her
single
12yearold
drug
conviction
constituted
an
aggravated
felony
offense
under
todays
immigration
laws
and
put
her
in
line
for
mandatory
detention
and
deportation
in
such
cases
judges
are
not
allowed
to
consider
a
persons
individual
circumstances
our
hands
are
tied
and
we
are
forced
to
order
automatic
deportation
we
arent
allowed
to
consider
the
fact
that
lundy
has
no
family
in
cambodia
is
a
successful
college
student
works
at
a
university
as
a
guidance
counselor
and
volunteers
in
her
community
as
judges
we
are
not
allowed
to
consider
her
rehabilitation
or
grant
her
a
second
chance
congress
stripped
immigration
judges
of
much
of
their
discretionary
authority
under
the
1996
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigrant
responsibility
act
under
this
law
we
are
no
longer
allowed
to
grant
most
forms
of
relief
for
those
with
an
aggravated
felony
conviction
on
their
record
no
matter
how
minor
or
old
the
offense
the
term
aggravated
felony
may
sound
like
a
big
deal
but
in
fact
the
category
is
a
term
of
art
that
includes
a
long
list
of
minor
and
nonviolent
offenses
that
are
not
felonies
under
the
law
todays
immigration
laws
are
enforced
so
consistently
that
our
immigration
courts
face
crushing
caseloads
and
chronically
insufficient
resources
the
current
backlog
of
360000plus
cases
means
an
average
wait
of
573
days
before
a
case
is
resolved
and
the
majority
of
people
coming
into
immigration
courts
do
so
without
lawyers
despite
the
high
stakes
and
incomprehensible
nature
of
our
immigration
law
theres
no
question
about
it
the
united
states
needs
immigration
reform
and
needs
it
now
reform
must
enhance
the
courts
resources
and
allow
immigration
judges
to
consider
the
individual
circumstances
unique
to
each
case
and
it
must
include
fairness
and
opportunity
for
those
who
seek
to
become
a
part
of
the
american
dream
our
leaders
to
be
true
leaders
cannot
continue
to
delay
putting
partisan
politics
above
the
needs
of
our
country
