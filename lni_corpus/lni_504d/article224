presidential
candidates
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
have
barely
touched
on
last
years
hottest
national
issue
immigration
activists
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
have
assailed
the
near
absence
of
the
issue
in
the
campaign
saying
it
seems
too
much
of
a
hot
potato
for
either
candidate
while
the
economy
is
they
say
justifiably
eclipsing
all
else
they
add
that
immigration
had
been
ignored
by
both
candidates
long
before
the
financial
crisis
for
the
top
two
people
running
to
lead
this
country
not
to
address
this
issue
which
is
integral
not
only
to
the
us
economy
but
the
future
character
of
this
nation
is
unconscionable
said
englewood
mayor
michael
wildes
an
immigration
attorney
who
sits
on
gov
jon
s
corzines
blue
ribbon
advisory
panel
on
immigrant
policy
a
spokesman
for
obama
said
the
senators
disproportionate
focus
on
the
economy
simply
is
a
response
to
voters
priorities
its
been
bubbling
up
andrew
poag
spokesman
for
obamas
campaign
in
new
jersey
said
of
the
economic
crisis
but
in
morristown
mayor
donald
cresitello
who
favors
strict
immigration
policies
said
candidates
should
not
ignore
other
important
matters
in
the
past
year
cresitello
has
been
one
of
the
countrys
most
vocal
officials
on
the
burden
that
federal
inaction
on
illegal
immigration
has
put
on
local
communities
no
one
is
saying
they
should
not
be
focusing
on
the
economy
cresitello
said
adding
its
absurd
to
think
that
the
candidates
and
the
country
should
only
focus
on
one
issue
at
a
time
immigration
and
the
economy
are
by
the
way
interconnected
theres
an
underground
economy
immigrant
workers
are
being
exploited
for
the
security
of
our
country
too
we
need
to
address
immigration
we
need
to
know
whos
here
500000
in
nj
an
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
live
in
the
united
states
about
a
halfmillion
in
new
jersey
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
measure
that
would
have
tightened
enforcement
and
provided
a
path
to
legalization
failed
to
win
approval
in
congress
last
year
amid
partisan
battling
as
efforts
to
address
reform
at
the
federal
level
ran
into
dead
ends
state
and
local
officials
have
taken
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
many
have
proposed
or
adopted
ordinances
that
punish
landlords
who
rent
to
illegal
immigrants
and
suspend
the
licenses
of
small
businesses
that
hire
them
most
such
efforts
however
foundered
when
challenged
in
court
immigration
is
a
federal
matter
but
local
communities
are
shouldering
the
challenges
wildes
said
and
all
there
is
from
the
candidates
and
federal
government
is
inaction
and
a
deafening
silence
americans
for
legal
immigration
a
lobby
that
wants
strict
immigration
enforcement
got
so
fed
up
with
the
scant
attention
paid
to
illegal
immigration
by
both
candidates
that
last
week
it
launched
a
web
site
called
obamaandmccainstinkcom
which
offers
disillusioned
voters
bumper
stickers
buttons
and
yard
signs
that
declare
both
obama
and
mccain
stink
in
their
voting
records
and
web
sites
obama
and
mccain
have
expressed
similar
views
on
immigration
issues
leading
many
observers
to
complain
theres
no
distinct
choice
obama
and
mccain
agree
with
many
key
provisions
in
the
illfated
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
of
last
year
both
support
stricter
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
as
well
as
beefing
up
security
along
the
nations
borders
at
the
same
time
theyve
also
said
they
support
a
path
to
legalization
for
illegal
immigrants
who
have
otherwise
broken
no
laws
while
living
in
the
us
conservatives
fume
the
dual
approach
of
enforcement
and
a
chance
at
legalization
sits
well
with
many
democrats
but
the
most
conservative
faction
of
the
republican
party
has
condemned
mccain
for
his
support
of
a
path
to
legalization
which
they
denounce
as
amnesty
for
lawbreakers
mccain
angered
the
staunchest
conservatives
in
his
party
when
he
cosponsored
an
ambitious
immigration
reform
bill
with
sen
ted
kennedy
dmass
in
2005
that
called
for
legalization
for
some
undocumented
immigrants
a
guest
worker
program
aimed
at
filling
jobs
that
employers
say
they
cannot
find
americans
to
do
and
enhanced
border
security
his
partnership
on
the
bill
considered
landmark
legislation
received
kudos
from
immigration
advocacy
groups
and
ethnic
communities
that
tend
to
see
the
gop
as
antiimmigrant
although
it
never
became
law
it
influenced
subsequent
proposals
but
those
same
groups
expressed
anger
after
mccain
last
year
began
distancing
himself
from
provisions
in
reform
bills
that
were
seen
as
going
easy
on
illegal
immigrants
and
started
focusing
more
on
strict
enforcement
of
the
border
hes
in
a
very
difficult
bind
said
amy
gottlieb
of
american
friends
service
committee
in
newark
until
his
campaign
for
president
he
was
one
of
the
republicans
most
willing
to
engage
in
a
real
dialogue
on
immigration
policy
now
he
just
says
we
must
first
control
the
border
before
we
talk
about
anything
else
about
immigration
immigration
advocates
favor
obama
who
in
littlepublicized
speeches
and
on
his
web
site
has
adopted
a
tone
of
sympathy
for
undocumented
immigrants
and
their
families
who
often
include
us
citizens
mccain
the
enforcer
those
who
favor
strict
enforcement
say
that
despite
his
unpopular
past
stances
on
immigration
mccain
would
be
more
effective
than
obama
at
repairing
the
countrys
broken
immigration
system
it
does
concern
me
that
he
was
an
author
on
the
socalled
amnesty
bill
said
gayle
kesselman
cochairwoman
of
the
new
jersey
concerned
citizens
for
immigration
control
but
he
did
say
he
understands
that
enforcement
and
border
security
have
to
come
first
if
youre
on
a
fishing
boat
that
has
holes
you
plug
the
holes
first
you
stop
the
hemorrhaging
said
kesselman
of
carlstadt
then
you
look
at
what
is
best
to
do
about
some
of
the
12
million
illegal
immigrants
who
havent
gotten
into
trouble
have
learned
english
and
lived
here
a
long
time
