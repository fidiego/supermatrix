the
groups
name
is
you
dont
speak
for
me
and
the
fledgling
organization
is
against
illegal
immigration
but
this
coalition
of
hispanics
which
has
a
presence
in
new
jersey
is
already
drawing
fire
from
a
growing
chorus
of
immigration
advocates
questioning
who
really
speaks
for
you
dont
speak
for
me
the
group
was
created
by
the
nations
most
powerful
lobbying
organization
for
strict
immigration
policies
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
which
is
based
in
washington
dc
also
sends
out
the
groups
emails
and
lists
its
own
officers
as
the
groups
spokesmen
its
a
front
group
for
fair
says
douglas
rivlin
of
the
national
immigration
forum
an
advocacy
group
in
washington
dc
antiimmigrant
groups
have
been
controlling
the
debate
on
immigration
for
most
of
the
last
decade
or
so
now
theyre
increasingly
worried
that
their
dominant
role
on
this
issue
is
eroding
fair
scoffs
at
the
criticism
and
says
it
is
merely
lending
support
to
hispanics
from
around
the
nation
who
share
its
views
on
immigration
and
who
want
another
hispanic
voice
heard
these
are
people
who
wanted
to
make
sure
that
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
were
represented
said
susan
wysoki
a
spokeswoman
for
fair
and
the
contact
on
you
dont
speak
for
me
press
releases
they
were
all
doing
their
own
thing
to
support
immigration
control
we
just
wanted
to
facilitate
their
coming
together
she
said
the
criticism
about
fairs
role
in
the
creation
of
you
dont
speak
for
me
particularly
vexes
the
hispanics
who
belong
to
it
you
dont
speak
for
me
members
strongly
condemn
illegal
immigration
they
call
for
strict
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
and
the
passage
of
additional
hardline
measures
they
denounce
congressional
proposals
that
would
allow
some
people
who
are
here
illegally
to
obtain
legal
status
you
dont
speak
for
me
says
that
its
members
truly
represent
hispanics
on
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
they
say
it
is
their
group
not
the
protesters
who
have
dominated
the
headlines
this
year
who
more
accurately
reflect
hispanic
americans
the
media
image
is
that
the
latino
community
is
in
favor
of
illegal
immigration
said
miguel
cruz
a
newark
resident
and
a
member
of
the
new
coalition
but
that
image
is
erroneous
hispanics
dont
all
think
the
same
way
those
of
us
who
are
us
citizens
who
are
here
legally
love
this
country
and
the
fact
that
its
a
country
of
laws
we
think
that
to
force
your
way
into
another
country
is
wrong
you
shouldnt
get
amnesty
we
should
close
the
border
entirely
he
takes
offense
at
the
notion
that
he
and
other
members
of
the
coalition
are
being
used
as
props
yes
the
coalition
is
fairs
creation
its
their
mission
but
the
truth
is
that
without
us
they
cant
do
it
cruz
said
they
tell
us
theres
a
press
conference
and
they
finance
the
travel
and
other
expenses
but
they
dont
tell
us
what
to
say
they
do
not
intrude
the
coalitions
chairman
albert
rodriguez
who
lives
in
arizona
grows
passionate
when
assailing
illegal
immigration
rodriguez
a
military
veteran
said
he
was
looking
to
form
a
coalition
of
likeminded
hispanics
and
he
embraced
fairs
assistance
when
it
was
offered
i
had
spoken
to
a
couple
of
american
hispanics
and
i
said
look
theyre
trying
to
lump
us
with
these
guys
and
implying
that
were
all
for
these
illegal
activities
of
illegal
aliens
i
said
we
have
to
do
something
about
this
we
have
to
start
telling
people
that
these
protesters
marching
with
illegal
aliens
dont
speak
for
me
thanks
to
fair
rodriguez
said
hispanics
who
favor
stricter
immigration
enforcement
are
joining
forces
he
said
more
than
1000
people
have
joined
the
group
via
its
web
site
you
dont
speak
for
me
members
concede
that
the
group
is
meant
to
challenge
the
notion
that
opposition
to
illegal
immigration
is
rooted
in
bigotry
if
youre
a
european
white
speaking
against
illegal
immigration
youre
automatically
considered
racist
said
carmen
morales
perez
a
you
dont
speak
for
me
member
who
lives
in
woodbridge
and
so
she
said
hispanics
speaking
out
are
heard
more
than
other
people
because
then
the
race
card
is
removed
and
its
just
about
what
theyre
saying
in
an
opinion
piece
for
a
community
newspaper
in
nevada
emma
sepulveda
a
professor
at
the
university
of
nevada
questions
the
strategy
of
pitting
latinos
against
each
other
once
you
begin
to
read
more
about
such
groups
and
their
connections
you
almost
always
find
some
of
the
most
virulent
antiimmigrant
organizations
behind
their
efforts
groups
such
as
fair
she
said
organizations
such
as
fair
are
making
inroads
now
in
trying
to
pit
latinos
against
latinos
and
that
could
have
a
demoralizing
effect
in
the
future
for
those
organizing
the
political
and
social
efforts
of
latino
coalitions
