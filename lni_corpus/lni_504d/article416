national
identity
cards
a
trial
balloon
floated
recently
by
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
is
a
proposal
that
deserves
early
burial
its
an
impractical
extremist
remedy
for
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
and
is
also
an
affront
to
privacy
compulsory
fingerprinting
which
would
be
required
would
provoke
a
response
that
would
make
the
protest
over
gun
control
look
tame
and
finally
weve
no
real
confidence
that
such
cards
could
be
made
counterfeitproof
or
would
stop
illegal
aliens
the
commission
would
do
well
to
concentrate
on
more
realistic
reforms
before
its
final
report
is
released
in
september
overhauling
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
certainly
warrants
high
priority
the
ins
fails
to
deport
three
out
of
four
illegal
aliens
and
if
the
commission
feels
compelled
to
be
provocative
it
can
suggest
that
the
white
house
cease
using
immigration
and
political
asylum
as
foreign
policy
tools
which
inconsistently
welcome
foreigners
to
and
shun
them
from
our
shores
