immigration
has
suddenly
jumped
off
the
back
burner
and
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
important
issues
confronting
the
usa
for
years
public
opinion
polls
have
been
telling
us
that
the
american
people
believe
legal
immigration
levels
are
too
high
and
that
illegal
immigration
is
out
of
control
the
sudden
attention
that
immigration
has
been
receiving
is
due
to
many
factors
the
most
important
is
the
unprecedented
number
of
immigrants
legal
and
illegal
who
are
settling
in
the
usa
each
year
depending
on
estimates
of
illegal
immigration
between
12
million
and
15
million
newcomers
settle
here
annually
this
influx
is
occurring
irrespective
of
the
ability
of
communities
to
absorb
the
new
settlers
the
costs
associated
with
immigration
and
they
are
enormous
the
strain
on
schools
public
health
facilities
housing
or
labor
markets
or
the
environment
proponents
of
the
status
quo
like
to
point
to
the
usas
immigrant
tradition
to
justify
the
current
extreme
levels
of
immigration
however
we
need
to
take
a
closer
look
at
what
the
tradition
really
is
between
1820
when
records
began
to
be
kept
and
1965
average
annual
immigration
was
297000
contrast
that
with
current
levels
and
you
realize
there
is
nothing
traditional
about
trying
to
absorb
the
equivalent
of
a
major
metropolitan
area
each
year
to
their
credit
the
american
people
have
directed
their
unhappiness
at
the
policies
and
the
people
who
make
immigration
policies
not
at
immigrants
themselves
public
disapproval
of
immigration
policies
is
as
legitimate
as
disapproval
of
tax
policies
or
the
budget
deficit
immigration
policy
is
after
all
a
public
policy
and
is
supposed
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
usa
clearly
the
american
people
do
not
feel
it

the

page
todays
debate
is
on
immigration
and
what
direction
our
national
policy
should
take
opposing
view
the
usa
cant
absorb
the
volume
of
newcomers
pouring
into
the
country
