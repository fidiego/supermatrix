the
federal
memo
on
the
immigration
prosecution
priority
shift
and
a
handout
from
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
a
shift
in
prioritizing
which
immigration
cases
to
prosecute
for
deportation
has
created
hope
some
of
it
false
among
those
living
in
the
country
illegally
the
change
does
not
alter
eligibility
for
legal
residency
or
prevent
an
arrest
but
it
may
stave
off
deportation
and
give
immigrants
a
chance
to
apply
for
a
work
visa
in
some
cases
according
to
oklahoma
immigration
attorneys
and
activists
there
is
no
immigration
benefit
being
derived
as
a
result
of
this
said
maria
reyes
director
of
the
ywca
multicultural
center
currently
there
is
no
existing
formal
policy
or
guidelines
it
is
totally
up
to
the
discretion
of
immigration
we
are
trying
to
warn
people
to
not
go
to
any
notarios
or
immigration
attorneys
who
are
misleading
people
andor
possibly
ripping
them
off
people
are
misunderstanding
this
due
to
misinformation
and
unrealistic
hope
a
memo
sent
by
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
director
john
morton
in
june
outlined
broad
criteria
prosecutors
may
use
in
deciding
to
close
a
case
the
agency
is
to
focus
more
aggressively
on
removing
immigrants
posing
a
threat
to
public
safety
and
repeat
immigration
law
violators
because
the
agency
is
confronted
with
more
administrative
violations
than
its
resources
can
address
the
agency
must
regularly
exercise
prosecutorial
discretion
if
it
is
to
prioritize
its
efforts
the
memo
stated
the
memo
was
followed
with
a
statement
aug
18
from
homeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
the
statement
announced
the
launch
of
a
casebycase
review
of
the
nearly
300000
cases
pending
in
immigration
courts
napolitanos
statement
said
immigrants
in
closed
cases
would
also
receive
a
chance
to
apply
for
a
work
permit
cases
deemed
low
priority
will
either
be
administratively
closed
or
no
enforcement
action
will
be
taken
a
temporary
decision
not
to
use
government
resources
to
deport
those
individuals
attorneys
said
this
applies
only
to
immigrants
with
cases
pending
it
does
not
give
a
pathway
for
the
estimated
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
including
about
75000
in
oklahoma
to
apply
for
work
authorization
while
the
immigration
service
has
not
been
forthcoming
with
details
the
june
memo
stated
that
those
benefiting
the
most
will
be
retired
and
active
military
members
longtime
lawful
residents
elderly
residents
people
brought
to
the
us
as
children
pregnant
or
nursing
women
victims
of
serious
crimes
and
people
with
disabilities
however
they
remain
deportable
and
have
no
benefits
said
attorney
chris
gentges
of
the
ywca
multicultural
center
it
will
only
impact
people
who
are
currently
in
detention
we
dont
know
the
impact
of
unauthorized
people
in
the
community
there
are
no
guidelines
at
this
time
the
number
of
cases
pending
in
immigration
courts
in
the
us
reached
an
alltime
high
of
267752
by
the
end
of
december
2010
which
is
44
percent
higher
than
the
end
of
the
2008
fiscal
year
according
to
a
report
by
the
nonprofit
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
trac
the
average
wait
for
a
case
resolution
nationally
is
about
467
days
up
from
456
days
in
september
2009
deportations
have
also
reached
recordsetting
highs
during
president
obamas
administration
with
more
than
393000
being
ordered
out
of
the
country
last
year
in
oklahoma
about
913
cases
are
pending
with
an
average
wait
of
326
days
last
year
1415
orders
of
removal
were
made
in
oklahoma
up
from
449
a
decade
earlier
according
to
trac
doug
stump
oklahoma
city
attorney
and
first
vice
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
said
attorneys
in
the
state
have
made
requests
for
deferred
action
in
pending
cases
but
the
immigration
service
is
still
making
those
reviews
the
agency
is
not
making
snap
decisions
in
oklahoma
they
are
measuring
the
equities
of
each
case
he
said
stumps
calls
the
change
simply
smart
enforcement
it
provides
government
an
effective
means
of
removing
on
a
priority
basis
those
undocumented
who
have
committed
crimes
or
would
otherwise
do
us
harm
stump
said
it
puts
those
individuals
who
pose
a
threat
to
society
at
the
very
top
of
the
removal
list
and
undocumented
grandmothers
tickets
for
signal
light
violations
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
the
government
has
limited
resources
to
conduct
so
the
new
policy
is
just
doing
what
is
done
in
good
practices
all
across
the
various
sectors
of
law
enforcement
it
targets
bad
guys
stump
criticized
programs
such
as
the
287g
agreement
with
the
tulsa
county
sheriffs
department
and
the
secure
communities
program
which
empower
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
enforce
the
federal
immigration
laws
programs
allowing
deputies
to
make
immigrationrelated
arrests
have
filled
the
court
system
with
undocumented
high
school
students
and
families
with
no
criminal
background
thus
allowing
criminal
aliens
to
drag
out
their
cases
for
years
stump
said
many
top
congressional
republicans
have
criticized
the
shift
in
priorities
calling
it
a
backdoor
amnesty
critics
say
this
is
an
electionyear
ploy
to
gain
support
among
hispanic
voters
and
immigration
advocates
this
is
the
latest
example
of
the
obama
administration
playing
politics
with
immigration
policy
stated
us
rep
john
sullivan
rtulsa
in
an
email
the
american
people
are
demanding
that
our
immigration
laws
be
strengthened
and
enforced
while
the
president
is
looking
for
any
way
he
can
find
to
bypass
them
and
that
is
unacceptable
our
immigration
problem
is
not
going
to
solve
itself
and
looking
the
other
way
only
magnifies
the
problem
carol
helm
of
immigration
reform
for
oklahoma
now
said
the
alltime
high
deportation
numbers
show
that
immigration
laws
and
enforcement
are
working
obama
is
knuckling
under
the
open
border
crowd
helm
said
that
crowd
is
nothing
more
than
the
one
world
order
crowd
wanting
no
borders
since
their
agenda
is
no
borders
they
believe
in
free
access
to
our
labor
and
money
thats
why
they
are
pushing
this
they
dont
want
any
restrictions
put
on
the
illegal
labor
coming
here

compared
the
move
to
a
dictatorship
and
pushes
for

of
the

legalization
temptation
act
halt
act
which
would
suspend
certain
federal
prosecutorial
discretions
in
immigration
cases
until
jan
21
2013
the
day
after
obamas
first
term
ends
it
was
prompted
by
the
announcements
i
just
wonder
how
far
we
as
a
nation
are
going
to
allow
this
administration
to
go
helm
said
the
halt
act
would
put
the
powers
of
the
president
back
where
it
should
be
its
an
antidote
to
his
power
grab
new
immigration
policy
what
it
is
not
not
an
amnesty
not
about
granting
legal
status
not
a
program
requiring
an
application
no
guarantee
a
case
will
be
deemed
low
priority
no
guarantee
low
priority
or
closed
cases
will
have
a
chance
to
apply
for
a

permit
what
it
is
creation
of
a
group
formed
from
officials
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
department
of
justice
to
review
cases
pending
and
close
those
it
considers

issue
guidance
on
providing
discretion
in
compelling
cases
for
people
who
already
have
a
final
order
of

implement
a

for
future
cases
to
be
reviewed
and

may
not
be
referred
to
immigration
court
no
rules
state
that
a
particular
type
of
case
will
be
deemed

how
immigration
courts
work
the

department
of
justices
executive
office
for
immigration
review
has
more
than
235
judges
across
the
country
conducting
administrative
proceedings
in
59
courts
the
judges
primarily
decide
whether
immigrants
charged
by
the

immigration
divisions
should
be
ordered
removed
from

not
provided
for
them
the

are
heard
by
one
of
four
judges
in
the
dallas
court
the

included
in

a
judge
usually
travels
to
oklahoma
for
one
week
a
month
to
hold
hearings
at
the
immigration
services
building
in
oklahoma
city
oklahoma
city
attorney
doug
stump
said
the
government
is
showing
indications
it
will
probably
close
the
oklahomabased
hearings
the
judges
are
too
busy
in
dallas
to

oklahoma
and
the

system
doesnt
have
the

to
man
the

docket
anymore

stump
said
the
immigration
court
system
is
about
to
collapse
with
the
rise
in

a
year
ago
we
were
looking
at
the
possibility
of
having
our

and
now
because
of
the
burdened
system
we
may
not
even
have
a
fully
functional
court
stump
said
closure
or
reduced

of

immigration

will
seriously
impact
