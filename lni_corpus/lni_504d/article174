the
immigration
debate
that
will
have
lasting
consequences
is
not
the
one
between
the
left
and
the
right
but
the
one
taking
place
within
the
ranks
of
conservatives
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
world
a
few
days
ago
during
a
visit
to
a
school
in
silver
spring
md
michelle
obama
was
confronted
by
a
7yearold
girl
who
asked
her
why
the
president
is
taking
everybody
away
that
doesnt
have
papers
with
mexican
first
lady
margarita
zavala
next
to
her
obama
responded
thats
something
we
have
to
work
on
right
the
girl
produced
a
devastating
rejoinder
but
my
mom
doesnt
have
any
papers
the
antiimmigration
right
led
by
radio
personality
rush
limbaugh
accused
the
white
house
of
staging
the
exchange
claiming
the
girl
had
botched
the
delivery
because
she
was
supposed
to
say
arizona
rather
than
obama
limbaugh
was
implying
that
it
was
a
stunt
to
obtain
sympathy
against
that
states
recent
antiimmigration
law
the
proimmigration
camp
in
the
republican
party
meanwhile
sidestepped
questions
about
the
incident
avoiding
confrontation
with
the
nativists
but
maintaining
enough
distance
to
signal
a
more
moderate
position
this
anecdote
illustrates
the
tension
within
the
right
at
large
sen
john
mccain
who
proposed
giving
millions
of
undocumented
foreigners
a
path
to
legalization
during
the
george
w
bush
administration
is
scared
of
losing
a
primary
against
an
antiimmigration
candidate
in
arizona
where
the
recent
law
is
popular
among
conservatives
mccains
lukewarm
support
for
a
law
he
intimately
dislikes
is
very
telling
about
the
relative
strength
of
the
anti
immigration
forces
within
the
party
the
chasm
within
the
right
goes
back
a
century
the
restrictive
laws
of
the
1920s
a
watershed
in
immigration
history
saw
a
split
between
nativist
republicans
and
southern
democrats
on
the
one
hand
and
the
business
community
which
wanted
immigrant
labor
on
the
other
the
intellectual
right
including
walter
lippmann
was
largely
proimmigration
when
president
ronald
reagan
a
proimmigration
conservative
gave
amnesty
to
3
million
immigrants
in
1986
he
had
to
include
in
the
law
sanctions
against
employers
this
reflected
the
pressure
from
the
antiimmigration
right
in
the
1990s
proposition
187
a
california
ballot
initiative
that
would
have
denied
public
services
to
undocumented
immigrants
became
a
flashpoint
of
the
conservativeagainstconservative
fight
its
most
prominent
backer
was
republican
gov
pete
wilson
but
several
gop
heavyweights
opposed
it
jack
kemp
and
william
bennett
put
out
a
statement
saying
the
vast
majority
of
immigrants
hold
principles
which
the
republican
party
warmly
embraces
an
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
selfreliance
hostility
to
government
intervention
strong
family
values
and
deeplyrooted
religious
faith
in
recent
years
the
debate
pitted
bush
mccain
and
other
proimmigrant
republicans
against
the
likes
of
rep
tom
tancredo
of
colorado
today
the
debate
rages
on
among
conservatives
the
wall
street
journal
is
a
staunch
supporter
of
immigration
while
sean
hannity
a
fox
news
talk
show
host
is
a
ferocious
critic
this
is
not
just
an
american
debate
in
spain
conservatives
are
equally
divided
the
regional
government
of
madrid
headed
by
popular
party
notable
esperanza
aguirre
with
help
from
her
immigration
secretary
javier
fernandezlasquetty
and
adviser
mauricio
rojas
a
former
swedish
parliamentarian
of
chilean
origin
has
tried
to
push
the
party
toward
embracing
immigration
there
is
strong
resistance
from
those
who
vilify
the
decision
by
the
spanish
government
to
legalize
700000
immigrants
in
2005
in
britains
conservative
party
a
gulf
separates
proimmigration
figures
such
as
former
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
kenneth
clarke
and
oxford
university
chancellor
and
former
hong
kong
gov
chris
patten
from
antiimmigrant
spokesmen
such
as
former
diplomat
andrew
green
chairman
of
migrationwatchuk
i
am
not
implying
there
is
no
debate
among
the
left
the
division
among
liberals
in
the
united
states
is
old
too
the
unions
opposed
immigration
for
decades
they
were
instrumental
in
ending
the
bracero
program
in
the
1960s
as
was
liberal
tv
journalist
edward
murrow
who
devoted
a
sensational
report
harvest
of
shame
to
denigrating
the
workpermit
program
many
on
the
left
furthermore
support
immigration
for
reasons
related
to
collectivist
multiculturalism
rather
than
to
the
free
movement
of
people
but
today
if
the
division
were
less
profound
on
the
right
immigration
reform
would
pass
it
is
the
type
of
issue
that
requires
a
broad
consensus
yet
the
paramount
factor
today
is
that
a
faction
of
the
right
has
forcefully
held
its
ground
against
anything
that
smacks
of
legalizing
the
people
who
live
in
the
shadows
and
creating
an
avenue
for
significant
future
inflows
until
the
debate
among
conservatives
is
settled
no
meaningful
reform
is
possible
