shortly
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
sept
11
rep
gil
gutknecht
angrily
walked
out
of
a
closeddoor
briefing
when
immigration
and
naturalization
service
commissioner
james
ziglar
said
the
services
main
job
was
to
help
people
get
into
the
country
gutknecht
declared
ziglar
didnt
get
it
that
his
job
was
to
protect
the
borders
and
enforce
the
immigration
laws
within
them
after
illegal
immigrants
have
rallied
throughout
the
country
for
legal
rights
gutknecht
says
immigration
officials
along
with
the
bush
administration
and
now
the
senate
are
still
failing
gutknecht
has
emerged
as
the
most
vocal
member
of
the
minnesota
delegation
on
immigration
and
he
doesnt
shy
away
from
a
hardliner
label
in
december
he
said
congress
was
finally
getting
the
message
after
the
house
passed
a
gettough
immigration
bill
calling
for
700
miles
of
fencing
along
the
southern
border
the
senate
plans
to
take
up
the
issue
this
week
but
after
it
jostled
over
the
issue
last
month
and
failed
to
reach
agreement
the
sixterm
republican
complained
that
the
bill
had
succumbed
to
the
graveyard
of
all
good
ideas
you
cannot
have
a
serious
discussion
about
any
other
changes
including
a
guestworker
program
until
you
demonstrate
that
youre
credible
on
defending
the
borders
and
enforcing
the
law
said
gutknecht
who
likens
his
immigration
views
to
those
of
illegalimmigration
hawk
rep
tom
tancredo
rcolo
gutknecht
has
held
forums
on
illegal
immigration
in
albert
lea
and
worthington
the
former
with
tancredo
and
was
one
of
72
members
of
congress
who
sent
a
letter
to
the
senate
in
late
march
asking
it
to
deal
with
immigration
enforcement
before
any
amnesty
he
is
rated
the
highest
among
minnesotans
in
congress
by
americans
for
better
immigration
which
lobbies
for
reduced
immigration
he
said
that
worthington
a
meatpacking
town
where
immigrants
make
up
a
quarter
of
the
population
of
11000
is
ground
zero
for
this
whole
debate
and
that
albert
lea
is
in
a
similar
situation
debating
with
opponents
tim
walz
gutknechts
democratic
opponent
in
novembers
election
has
repeatedly
criticized
gutknechts
emphasis
on
immigration
walz
said
leaders
need
to
gauge
the
need
for
unskilled
labor
and
adjust
legal
immigration
policies
accordingly
he
said
gutknecht
is
dodging
other
issues
such
as
the
iraq
war
and
is
turning
up
the
immigration
rhetoric
because
he
thinks
it
plays
well
with
voters
the
congressman
just
needs
to
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
traveling
the
district
and
hell
find
out
thats
not
a
winner
either
walz
said
gutknecht
disagrees
he
said
many
constituents
are
telling
him
close
the
damn
border
enforce
the
law
he
dismisses
the
argument
that
illegal
immigrants
take
jobs
americans
dont
want
he
says
that
he
is
open
to
a
guestworker
program
and
that
he
would
even
be
open
to
citizenship
if
someone
could
prove
to
him
that
its
fair
to
everyone
else
especially
legal
immigrants
but
for
gutknecht
all
of
that
is
secondary
to
enforcement
he
said
the
bush
administration
has
a
credibility
problem
because
it
doesnt
seem
particularly
interested
in
enforcing
the
law
and
he
called
it
embarrassing
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
still
doesnt
have
a
method
for
defining
who
is
in
the
country
legally
he
said
that
illegal
immigrant
labor
boils
down
to
basic
economics
and
that
americans
will
do
almost
anything
if
you
pay
them
enough
he
wants
to
crack
down
on
employers
hiring
illegal
immigrants
and
to
create
an
id
card
that
shows
an
immigrants
legal
status
javier
morilloalicea
local
26
president
of
the
service
employees
international
union
said
gutknechts
enforcement
ideas
are
out
of
touch
with
most
voters
and
condemned
him
for
recently
citing
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
in
an
immigration
brochure
the
group
seeks
to
reduce
immigration
into
the
united
states
a
group
like
fair
and
their
extreme
position
of
enforcement
only
is
quickly
falling
outside
of
the
mainstream
morilloalicea
said
adding
it
ties
him
to
a
broader
rightwing
agenda
and
i
think
most
minnesotans
are
on
neither
side
of
the
spectrum
said
jon
yarian
gutknechts
spokesman
if
mr
morillaalicea
has
specific
concerns
about
the
information
we
used
he
should
tell
us
