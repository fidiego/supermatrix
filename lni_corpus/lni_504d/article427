to

a
lawyer
representing
14
nonresidents
of
canada
arrested
at
a
demonstration
monday
says
their
continued
detention
under
a
rarely
used
section
of
the
immigration
act
is
absurd
and
politically
motivated
robert
kellermann
says
immigration
officials
believe
that
because
the
13
americans
and
one
west
german
are
anarchists
they
are
violent
and
therefore
inadmissible
to
canada
this
is
completely
absurd
the
prisoners
are
among
28
people
arrested
and
charged
with
offences
ranging
from
mischief
to
assault
during
a
demonstration
in
downtown
toronto
against
the
us
downing
of
an
iranian
airliner
most
of
the
demonstrators
were
attending
a
weekend
conference
of
anarchists
although
all
but
one
were
released
on
bail
after
being
charged
monday
evening
the
foreigners
were
immediately
detained
by
immigration
officials
who
had
obtained
arrest
warrants
for
them
they
are
being
held
under
section
19
1
g
of
the
immigration
act
which
permits
immigration
officials
to
deny
admission
to
people
they
believe
will
engage
in
acts
of
violence
or
are
likely
to
participate
in
the
unlawful
activities
of
an
organization
that
is
likely
to
engage
in
such
acts
of
violence
either
somebody
is
living
in
a
dreamworld
or
theyre
out
to
harass
these
people
mr
kellermann
said
if
they
really
believe
these
are
people
likely
to
commit
acts
of
violence
it
can
only
be
on
the
basis
of
an
image
of
anarchists
which
is
totally
false
and
ignorant
five
people
at
the
conference
had
been
arrested
during
the
weekend
under
immigration
laws
but
four
of
them
were
released
after
bail
was
posted
an
immigration
spokesman
said
immigration
hearings
are
scheduled
to
begin
today
if
the
judgment
goes
against
them
the
prisoners
could
be
deported
and
barred
from
reentering
canada
the
immigration
arrests
appear
to
have
been
made
because
the
visitors
allegedly
misrepresented
themselves
at
the
border
by
not
saying
they
were
going
to
the
conference
but
mr
kellerman
questioned
the
grounds
under
which
immigration
officials
became
involved
at
all
many
people
are
arrested
during
visits
to
canada
without
immigration
officials
becoming
involved
he
said
adding
that
the
only
explanation
for
their
action
against
his
clients
is
the
conference
they
attended
ron
bull
a
spokesman
for
the
toronto
regional
office
of
the
department
of
employment
and
immigration
would
not
say
why
the
group
had
been
detained
except
to
note
the
section
under
which
they
had
been
arrested
he
also
said
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
department
to
be
involved
when
nonresidents
are
arrested
for
criminal
offences
if
the
offence
warrants
action
under
the
immigration
act
that
action
is
usually
taken
yesterday
morning
dozens
of
police
watched
by
reporters
were
patrolling
nathan
phillips
square
acting
on
inside
information
that
the
anarchists
would
hold
another
demonstration
nothing
happened
deputy
police
chief
william
mccormack
said
the
violence
of
mondays
demonstration
was
unexpected
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
was
absolutely
deplorable
mr
mccormack
said
the
information
we
had
was
that
it
was
to
be
a
peaceful
demonstration
the
original
contingent
of
70
officers
grew
to
between
150
and
200
as
battles
erupted
between
police
and
demonstrators
throughout
the
central
city
area
many
demonstrators
have
accused
the
police
of
being
deliberately
brutal
in
their
arrests
linda
thomas
of
toronto
had
a
splint
on
one
wrist
and
a
bandage
around
the
other
yesterday
she
said
she
was
injured
because
of
the
way
her
hand
was
bent
over
by
the
arresting
officer
and
because
plastic
handcuffs
were
applied
in
the
plastic
handcuffs
which
consist
of
a
plastic
band
that
can
be
pulled
tight
but
not
loosened
my
hands
went
all
red
and
swelled
up
and
my
fingertips
went
blue
i
couldnt
feel
them
after
two
minutes
ms
thomas
said
frank
addario
a
lawyer
who
is
representing
some
of
the
demonstrators
said
police
tried
to
hurt
demonstrators
in
applying
the
cuffs
they
prisoners
would
say
thats
too
tight
and
the
cop
would
say
watch
this
and
give
it
a
couple
of
more
tugs
it
was
completely
unnecessary
and
gratuitous
but
mr
mccormack
denied
that
unnecessary
force
was
used
i
think
under
the
circumstances
extreme
restraint
was
used
by
all
personnel
involved
under
very
trying
circumstances
were
not
accustomed
in
this
city
to
that
kind
of
disorder
all
canadians
were
released
monday
evening
except
one
who
was
released
on
bail
