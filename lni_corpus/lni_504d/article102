on
wednesday
the
supreme
court
will
hear
the
state
of
arizona
argue
that
it
has
a
right
to
enforce
its
own
immigration
laws
the
federal
government
will
counter
that
only
it
has
constitutional
authority
to
write
immigration
law
and
that
allowing
individual
states
to
do
so
would
invite
legal
havoc
and
could
cause
rifts
with
foreign
allies
since
five
other
states
also
have
recently
passed
strict
immigration
enforcement
laws
parts
of
which
hinge
on
the
arizona
outcome
many
people
including
illegal
immigrants
are
watching
the
case
closely
the
stakes
are
high
said
florida
international
university
law
professor
and
constitutional
expert
elizabeth
price
foley
not
only
is
legal
precedent
in
play
but
interaction
between
police
and
minorities
on
us
streets
in
particular
latinos
also
could
be
affected
while
florida
has
not
passed
its
own
immigration
legislation
such
bills
have
bounced
around
the
state
legislature
the
past
two
years
and
the
arizona
ruling
could
affect
future
florida
law
florida
and
15
other
states
filed
a
brief
with
the
court
in
support
of
arizona
states
have
a
preexisting
authority
to
make
arrests
based
on
violations
of
federal
law
that
brief
states
meanwhile
11
states
and
41
countries
filed
briefs
siding
with
the
federal
government
an
indication
of
the
resonance
of
the
arizona
battle
the
case
also
has
divided
national
organizations
active
on
both
sides
of
the
emotional
immigration
issue
sb
1070
is
not
only
constitutional
but
necessary
in
the
face
of
the
obama
administrations
refusal
to
enforce
the
law
and
protect
the
security
and
interests
of
the
american
people
said
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
the
most
powerful
conservative
group
active
on
the
immigration
issue
but
the
liberal
national
immigration
law
center
sees
it
differently
our
countrys
greatness
is
derived
from
its
diversity
said
executive
director
marilena
hincapie
no
law
should
force
those
of
us
who
look
or
sound
foreign
to
be
subject
to
racial
profiling
or
other
discrimination
unfortunately
arizonans
basic
rights
will
be
at
risk
if
sb
1070
is
allowed
to
go
into
effect
and
the
ramifications
of
this
decision
will
be
felt
across
the
country
disputed
sections
of
the
law
in
2010
arizona
passed
senate
bill
1070
becoming
the
first
state
in
the
modern
era
to
try
adopt
its
own
immigration
law
federal
courts
subsequently
let
parts
of
the
law
stand
but
blocked
others
the
supreme
court
is
expected
to
rule
in
june
on
those
disputed
sections
one
section
requires
that
arizona
state
and
local
police
determine
the
immigration
status
of
any
person
encountered
in
a
lawful
stop
if
reasonable
suspicion
exists
the
person
is
not
legally
in
the
us
the
arizona
law
also
makes
it
a
criminal
act
for
a
person
to
be
in
work
in
or
seek
work
in
the
state
without
proper
documents
to
prove
that
person
is
in
the
us
legally
under
federal
law
those
are
civil
infractions
not
criminal
another
disputed
section
allows
arizona
police
to
arrest
people
without
warrants
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
their
being
deported
a
duty
currently
overseen
only
by
federal
agents
justice
elena
kagan
who
was
solicitor
general
in
the
obama
administration
when
the
government
sued
arizona
will
not
participate
in
the
case
her
recusal
creates
the
possibility
of
a
44
vote
in
that
case
the
verdict
of
the
lower
courts
would
be
upheld
and
arizona
would
lose
legal
experts
say
the
case
will
hang
on
an
issue
known
as
preemption
which
means
that
federal
law
supersedes
state
law
if
the
two
conflict
but
arizona
is
arguing
that
it
is
not
exceeding
or
violating
federal
law
simply
helping
enforce
it
sb
1070
does
not
impose
its
own
substantive
immigration
standards
but
simply
uses
state
resources
to
enforce
federal
rules
arizona
states
in
its
brief
arizona
officials
say
they
were
forced
to
act
because
the
arizona
desert
had
become
the
preferred
route
for
throngs
of
illegal
immigrants
crossing
into
the
country
and
the
us
was
not
doing
enough
to
stop
them
in
its
brief
the
state
refers
to
the
relaxed
and
indeterminate
enforcement
posture
of
the
federal
government
no
one
doubts
that
unlawful
immigration
has
a
disproportionate
impact
on
arizona
the
brief
says
its
a
national
issue
us
says
in
response
the
us
asserts
that
the
national
government
is
responsible
for
the
treatment
of
foreign
citizens
on
us
soil
because
it
is
the
nation
as
a
whole
not
any
single
state
that
must
respond
to
the
international
consequences
of
such
treatment
the
government
says
enforcing
immigration
law
involves
numerous
considerations
including
national
security
and
law
enforcement
but
also
foreign
policy
and
humanitarian
considerations
arizona
seeks
to
interpose
its
own
judgments
on
those
sensitive
subjects
the
us
brief
states
arizona
has
adopted
its
own
immigration
policy
which
focuses
solely
on
maximum
enforcement
for
each
state
and
each
locality
to
set
its
own
immigration
policy
in
that
fashion
would
wholly
subvert
congress
goal
of
a
single
national
approach
the
brief
says
fius
price
foley
said
that
in
deciding
the
case
the
court
must
establish
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
many
regulations
contained
in
the
us
immigration
and
nationality
act
did
congress
intend
when
passing
the
current
federal
immigration
law
to
occupy
the
field
of
immigration
and
not
allow
states
to
get
involved
she
said
or
alternatively
did
congress
want
states
to
help
enforce
immigration
law
she
said
language
exists
in
the
act
that
says
federal
officials
shall
respond
to
an
inquiry
by
a
federal
state
or
local
government
agency
seeking
to
verify
or
ascertain
the
citizenship
or
immigration
status
of
any
individual
that
language
suggests
that
congress
may
have
seen
a
role
for
states
in
enforcing
immigration
law
particularly
in
the
identification
of
illegal
aliens
she
said
price
foley
sympathizes
with
the
arizona
effort
if
the
arizona
law
is
struck
down
the
states
will
be
fully
at
the
mercy
of
a
seemingly
disinterested
federal
executive
branch
powerless
to
help
stop
the
flow
of
illegal
immigrants
across
the
borders
she
said
experts
ariz
has
uphill
fight
but
areto
imoukhuede
a
nova
southeastern
university
law
professor
said
he
will
be
very
surprised
if
arizona
wins
until
this
case
came
along
immigration
was
considered
a
textbook
example
of
a
field
of
law
that
congress
occupied
and
not
the
states
he
said
if
the
court
were
to
rule
for
arizona
it
would
be
contrary
to
our
understanding
of
constitutional
law
he
said
arizona
would
have
to
show
a
compelling
legal
reason
for
the
court
to
break
with
its
long
history
of
leaving
immigration
enforcement
to
the
federal
government
he
doubts
that
problems
caused
by
the
porous
border
will
be
reason
enough
if
you
have
lawlessness
along
the
border
how
do
you
address
it
he
asked
do
you
pass
a
blanket
law
based
on
immigration
status
do
you
risk
racial
profiling
is
that
the
only
way
to
do
it
he
said
he
doesnt
think
so
and
that
the
arizona
law
runs
afoul
of
equal
protection
principals
in
the
constitution
university
of
miami
law
professor
rebecca
sharpless
also
said
arizona
faces
an
uphill
climb
to
win
the
case
to
get
around
the
preemption
issue
in
the
supreme
court
case
arizona
is
trying
to
sell
its
immigration
enforcement
regime
as
mere
cooperation
with
the
federal
government
she
said
but
the
supreme
court
is
unlikely
to
buy
what
arizona
is
selling
she
said
one
reason
is
that
a
federal
program
287g
already
provides
for
cooperation
between
the
us
and
states
in
immigration
matters
but
under
the
direction
of
the
us
she
also
said
that
while
the
conservative
majority
on
the
court
has
often
been
sympathetic
to
states
rights
in
other
cases
immigration
is
different
territory
the
supreme
court
justices
who
have
traditionally
believed
in
state
power
have
also
traditionally
deferred
to
federal
immigration
authorities
she
said
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
justices
rule
in
the
arizona
case
