john
flynn
teaches
his
university
of
utah
law
students
that
every
legal
decision
is
a
moral
one
an
ought
decision
laws
are
informed
by
a
moral
context
that
guides
courts
and
people
toward
justice
the
same
reasoning
should
apply
to
policy
decisions
unfortunately
the
current
immigration
conversation
suggests
that
political
considerations
trump
moral
ones
word
play
substitutes
for
wisdom
symbols
smother
substance
debate
rages
not
over
right
and
wrong
but
over
labels
such
as
illegal
undocumented
amnesty
and
earned
adjustment
this
has
impeded
the
free
flow
of
information
and
an
informed
dialogue
last
tuesday
morning
behind
the
utah
capitol
11
students
and
two
faculty
mentors
comprising
the
university
of
utah
honors
think
tank
on
immigration
released
a
factual
guide
immigration
in
context
a
resource
guide
for
utah
in
the
hope
of
adding
to
expanding
and
informing
the
immigration
debate
for
legislators
schools
and
state
residents
most
important
the
group
did
not
take
a
specific
stand
on
immigration
resolving
the
immigration
challenge
requires
dealing
with
the
approximately
12
million
people
living
here
in
violation
of
civil
immigration
law
pew
hispanic
center
surveys
from
this
year
and
last
show
that
about
60
percent
of
american
voters
favor
immigration
status
for
undocumented
workers
who
have
lived
here
for
more
than
two
years
paid
taxes
and
passed
a
security
check
results
and
opinions
vary
depending
on
whether
workers
are
labeled
illegal
or
undocumented
should
undocumented
workers
be
granted
amnesty
is
earned
adjustment
a
more
acceptable
term
words
and
labels
matter
the
think
tank
thought
it
important
to
remind
the
reader
that
immigration
affects
real
people
perhaps
the
best
label
for
those
real
people
is
human
being
a
category
open
to
all
regardless
of
their
nationality
or
immigration
status
utahs
undocumented
population
estimated
to
number
about
100000
has
grown
over
the
past
15
years
which
not
coincidentally
has
been
a
period
of
robust
economic
expansion
and
projects
including
significant
road
building
major
construction
and
the
2002
winter
olympics
undocumented
workers
performed
much
of
the
difficult
labor
for
those
projects
those
workers
deserve
consideration
utahs
current
job
growth
rate
of
45
percent
an
unemployment
rate
of
24
percent
demographic
trends
and
economic
expectations
indicate
the
state
will
continue
to
rely
on
net
migration
of
workers
immigration
reforms
that
increase
efficiencies
and
better
match
law
to
reality
surely
would
benefit
utah
economically
still
other
costs
and
benefits
merit
consideration
much
is
made
of
crime
among
the
undocumented
and
recent
stories
have
grabbed
headlines
nevertheless
it
is
inescapable
that
the
undocumented
are
many
times
more
likely
to
be
victims
of
crimes
than
perpetrators
indeed
the
undocumented
have
as
much
interest
as
the
documented
in
keeping
the
community
safe
human
beings
should
work
together
for
that
end
the
effects
of
immigration
are
unevenly
felt
immigrant
labor
may
fill
a
business
need
and
bring
about
lower
prices
for
consumers
while
subjecting
some
workers
to
increased
competition
for
jobs
wise
policymakers
might
address
this
through
improved
and
more
widely
accessible
workertraining
programs
the
current
immigration
system
is
broken
while
immigration
reform
will
not
please
all
people
reform
is
necessary
twelve
million
people
are
not
going
to
disappear
the
costs
and
benefits
of
immigration
elude
easy
quantification
but
both
merit
examination
society
needs
to
move
toward
an
informed
honest
and
collaborative
debate
congress
ought
to
press
forward
with
immigration
reform
that
enhances
individual
effort
for
maximal
societal
benefit
a
moral
decision
that
respects
the
dignity
of
every
human
being
