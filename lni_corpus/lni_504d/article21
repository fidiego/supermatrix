theyre
tired
of
illegal
immigration
of
people
who
they
say
make
a
mockery
of
us
laws
and
drive
down
wages
so
on
saturday
morning
immigration
control
activists
are
joining
in
a
nationwide
demonstration
stop
the
invasion
coordinated
to
take
place
near
sites
where
day
laborers
congregate
to
call
for
tougher
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
and
tighter
patrolling
of
us
borders
some
36
groups
will
protest
in
about
20
states
including
new
jersey
say
national
organizers
we
want
to
preserve
our
country
for
everyone
said
ron
bass
founder
of
united
patriots
of
america
an
essex
countybased
group
that
is
organizing
the
new
jersey
protest
for
legal
immigrants
as
well
as
other
americans
we
want
to
send
a
message
to
illegal
aliens
that
youre
in
this
country
illegally
youre
breaking
our
laws
said
bass
who
is
planning
to
hold
the
protest
in
bergen
county
a
magnet
for
day
laborers
over
the
last
decade
he
refused
to
disclose
the
exact
location
out
of
concern
that
proimmigrant
activists
would
try
to
undermine
his
groups
plans
new
jersey
has
the
nations
fifthlargest
immigrant
population
and
increasingly
draws
illegal
immigrants
because
of
its
many
ethnic
communities
and
plentiful
jobs
in
such
areas
as
restaurants
construction
and
landscaping
the
population
of
illegal
immigrants
in
the
state
has
been
estimated
at
300000
to
500000
they
come
mostly
from
spanishspeaking
countries
particularly
mexico
guatemala
and
el
salvador
among
others
the
nationwide
protest
is
being
coordinated
by
the
connecticut
citizens
for
immigration
control
a
group
that
advocates
closing
us
borders
and
deporting
illegal
immigrants
one
of
its
founders
paul
streitz
said
the
demonstration
is
meant
to
call
attention
to
illegal
immigration
at
a
time
when
congress
is
poised
to
discuss
major
immigration
reform
proposals
nationally
coordinated
protests
usually
are
staged
by
proimmigration
advocates
those
on
the
opposing
side
tend
to
be
less
public
fearing
retaliation
and
usually
draw
much
smaller
crowds
to
their
events
but
immigration
control
groups
have
grown
bolder
as
theyve
seen
a
conservative
momentum
build
in
washington
backing
tougher
border
enforcement
recent
polls
show
many
americans
believe
some
illegal
immigrants
should
have
a
chance
to
become
legal
but
they
also
think
the
us
government
has
been
too
lax
in
controlling
the
borders
so
in
an
important
election
year
many
in
congress
are
making
immigration
a
cause
célèbre
on
the
more
liberal
end
some
bills
call
for
legalizing
illegal
immigrants
who
pass
a
certain
set
of
criteria
and
providing
temporary
visas
for
foreigners
to
do
jobs
that
are
hard
to
fill
with
americans
on
the
conservative
end
other
bills
call
for
making
illegal
immigration
a
felony
and
giving
local
police
more
powers
to
arrest
people
for
being
here
illegally
some
of
those
bills
have
been
called
the
most
draconian
immigration
measures
in
recent
us
history
like
many
immigrationcontrol
proponents
streitz
says
that
simply
enforcing
existing
laws
would
be
enough
to
solve
many
of
the
problems
associated
with
illegal
immigration
additional
laws
will
help
but
what
good
would
they
be
if
theres
no
enforcement
he
asked
we
already
have
many
strong
laws
angela
kelley
deputy
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
washington
dcbased
proimmigrant
group
says
the
system
needs
to
change
but
that
tougher
enforcement
alone
is
not
the
answer
we
do
have
a
broken
immigration
system
kelley
said
but
what
we
need
is
to
control
immigration
in
a
realistic
and
effective
way
that
gives
people
who
are
deserving
legal
channels
through
which
to
come
here
all
these
years
weve
thrown
more
and
more
money
at
border
control
and
we
just
have
more
illegal
immigrants
than
ever
she
said
another
immigration
advocate
is
condemning
the
protests
as
racist
these
people
have
to
face
that
our
country
has
supported
many
of
the
governments
that
have
created
instability
that
force
these
people
to
leave
their
countries
said
esther
chavez
a
community
activist
for
american
friends
service
committee
in
newark
who
often
assists
day
laborers
how
can
we
just
ignore
that
connection
illegal
immigrants
are
the
most
exploited
group
in
our
country
chavez
said
my
goodness
right
now
i
have
29
active
cases
of
day
laborers
whove
been
stiffed
by
the
contractors
who
they
did
work
for
these
people
were
worked
to
the
bone
and
stiffed
out
of
42000
in
wages
the
protest
organizers
are
not
sympathetic
they
are
determined
to
take
their
protests
to
the
source
of
their
concern
illegal
immigrant
workers
because
the
real
problem
as
we
see
it
is
the
employment
of
illegal
immigrants
if
you
dry
up
the
employment
the
illegals
will
go
home
streitz
said
thats
why
we
going
to
these
sites
for
our
protest
to
make
that
point
in
new

protests
are
planned
for
rockland
county
and
long

where
confrontations
between

and

11000
