length
1050
words
with
president
bush
and
a
growing
parade
of
congressmen
vowing
to
monitor
international
students
and
hunt
down
foreigners
in
the
country
illegally
it
is
becoming
clearer
every
day
that
the
immigration
debate
has
shifted
dramatically
since
sept
11
just
two
months
ago
bush
was
hinting
at
amnesty
for
millions
of
illegal
aliens
and
giving
antiimmigration
groups
a
headache
now
americans
are
casting
a
wary
eye
on
foreigners
and
groups
that
want
to
restrict
immigration
are
suddenly
seeing
their
onceunpopular
ideas
increased
border
patrols
tamperproof
visas
embraced
at
the
highest
levels
of
government
this
is
a
real
opportunity
said
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
has
been
pushing
for
tighter
immigration
controls
for
years
proimmigration
groups
insist
the
broader
immigration
issues
whether
to
legalize
undocumented
immigrants
or
tighten
immigration
numbers
have
not
been
affected
by
the
current
events
but
signs
abound
of
washingtons
new
attitude
toward
foreigners
democratic
sen
dianne
feinstein
of
california
has
proposed
the
most
farreaching
package
of
immigration
reforms
so
far
her
bill
would
create
a
centralized
database
of
visa
holders
and
other
nonus
citizens
pay
for
smartvisa
cards
encoded
with
iris
images
palm
prints
and
digitized
photos
and
halt
student
visas
from
countries
on
the
governments
list
of
terroristsponsoring
states
cosponsored
by
arizona
republican
jon
kyl
the
bill
would
affect
hundreds
of
millions
of
foreign
travelers
and
international
students
our
borders
have
become
a
sieve
creating
ample
opportunities
for
terrorists
to
enter
and
establish
their
operations
without
detection
feinstein
told
reporters
last
week
bush
speaking
at
the
inaugural
meeting
of
his
homeland
security
council
also
targeted
student
visas
administration
officials
say
he
favors
a
system
in
which
students
movements
in
the
country
would
be
monitored
with
the
help
of
a
huge
electronic
visa
database
other
lawmakers
are
talking
about
abolishing
the
visa
lottery
program
also
known
as
the
green
card
lottery
which
doles
out
55000
permanent
residence
visas
to
countries
with
low
immigration
rates
still
others
want
to
add
agents
along
the
vast
and
mostly
unprotected
canadian
border
just
334
immigration
and
naturalization
service
agents
patrol
the
3728mile
northern
border
crossed
annually
by
100
million
people
many
of
the
proposals
echo
recommendations
made
by
antiimmigration
groups
immediately
after
the
sept
11
attacks
illustrating
the
new
influence
those
organizations
now
wield
in
washington
i
think
theres
no
question
those
groups
have
gained
an
immediate
credibility
said
james
gimpel
a
university
of
maryland
professor
who
has
written
extensively
about
immigration
their
proposals
make
sense
in
a
way
they
didnt
two
months
before
washingtons
sudden
embrace
of
immigration
reform
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
by
the
new
popularity
of
rep
tom
tancredo
a
republican
from
colorado
his
immigration
reform
caucus
has
added
about
15
lawmakers
to
its
roster
since
sept
11
and
tancredo
was
recently
invited
to
a
meeting
with
house
speaker
dennis
hastert
something
he
had
begged
for
many
times
before
the
attacks
to
no
avail
some
of
tancredos
proposals
such
as
a
sixmonth
moratorium
on
all
visas
probably
have
little
support
but
many
of
his
ideas
such
as
adding
digital
photos
and
fingerprints
to
visas
are
likely
to
be
adopted
krikorian
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
said
he
expects
the
new
national
mood
will
help
several
immigration
reform
candidates
get
elected
in
the
next
congressional
elections
for
a
long
time
krikorian
said
we
had
come
to
view
the
borders
as
an
irritant
that
travelers
and
business
people
needed
to
overcome
and
congress
by
commission
or
omission
acted
to
weaken
them
he
added
that
seems
to
have
changed
but
proimmigration
organizations
insist
they
are
not
ready
to
surrender
on
the
contrary
many
insist
the
debate
in
washington
has
actually
hewed
to
a
moderate
center
some
groups
for
example
have
been
calling
for
new
limits
on
the
number
of
immigrants
allowed
in
each
year
but
that
idea
hasnt
gained
much
support
the
antiimmigration
groups
have
been
tweaking
their
agendas
to
try
to
see
how
far
they
can
go
to
see
if
they
can
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
said
doug
rivlin
of
the
national
immigration
forum
but
the
politicians
on
this
issue
have
made
those
people
look
increasingly
isolated
the
moderate
members
have
been
saying
dont
overreact
bushs
consistent
pleas
for
tolerance
have
helped
set
a
moderate
tone
and
a
strong
national
feeling
of
unity
since
the
attacks
has
stanched
a
widespread
antiimmigrant
backlash
said
josh
bernstein
senior
policy
analyst
with
the
national
immigration
law
center
which
promotes
the
rights
of
lowincome
immigrants
there
is
a
recognition
that
were
all
in
this
together
and
that
unity
includes
immigrants
bernstein
said
before
the
attacks
proimmigration
groups
were
optimistic
that
bush
would
continue
a
shift
toward
more
liberal
immigration
policies
among
the
ideas
being
discussed
was
legalizing
more
than
3
million
undocumented
mexicans
living
in
the
united
states
krikorian
said
opposition
to
that
idea
has
intensified
and
that
there
is
no
real
possibility
it
can
pass
granting
legal
status
to
those
living
here
illegally
strikes
me
as
ridiculous
at
this
point
krikorian
said
but
proimmigration
groups
hope
that
proposal
wont
fall
victim
to
the
current
effort
to
root
out
terrorists
rivlin
said
the
bush
administration
has
kept
up
a
dialogue
with
mexico
and
told
mexican
president
vicente
fox
recently
dont
go
away
much
will
depend
rivlin
said
on
public
sentiment
next
year
gimpel
believes
the
united
states
history
as
a
nation
of
immigrants
will
prevent
it
from
completely
shutting
down
its
borders
he
foresees
a
country
that
is
still
welcoming
but
with
far
more
tightly
regulated
borders
i
think
people
still
have
this
romantic
notion
of
america
as
a
place
where
people
can
come
and
be
successful
he
said
well
now
well
update
that
and
say
its
also
a
place
where
their
backgrounds
have
to
be
checked
first
