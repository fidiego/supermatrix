immigration
reform
is
a
hotbutton
issue
and
no
one
seems
to
agree
on
a
solution
not
even
the
experts
one
group
of
immigration
experts
grappled
with
how
public
opinion
shapes
the
debate
during
a
panel
discussion
friday
on
the
politics
of
immigration
at
the
national
association
of
hispanic
journalists
convention
in
denver
panelists
approached
the
issue
from
their
respective
fields
of
study
giving
each
one
a
slightly
different
viewpoint
nelson
castillo
an
immigration
attorney
said
the
political
will
to
accomplish
comprehensive
immigration
reform
within
one
year
is
not
there
the
white
house
says
they
want
it
but
i
dont
think
theyre
putting
in
the
political
capital
to
get
this
moving
castillo
said
steven
camarota
director
of
research
for
the
center
for
immigration
studies
likened
the
immigration
debate
to
the
title
of
a
book
about
abortion
a
clash
of
absolutes
not
only
do
we
have
a
broken
immigration
system
camarota
said
we
have
a
broken
immigration
debate
camarota
said
talking
about
immigration
is
difficult
because
it
is
an
issue
that
strikes
at
peoples
core
beliefs
paul
voakes
dean
of
the
school
of
journalism
and
mass
communication
at
the
university
of
colorado
at
boulder
called
immigration
a
thirdrail
issue
voakes
who
studies
how
media
cover
immigration
said
part
of
the
problem
is
that
people
dont
like
talking
about
immigration
he
said
that
in
the
mainstream
media
immigration
receives
relatively
little
coverage
until
it
spikes
close
to
election
time
however
in
talkshow
media
hosts
blend
news
with
opinion
distorting
the
issue
voakes
said
the
problem
with
this
is
we
dont
know
how
to
cover
this
until
the
politicians
frame
this
for
us
and
that
is
bad
