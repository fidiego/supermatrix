president
bush
made
immigration
reform
his
main
domestic
issue
when
he
gave
a
live
primetime
address
in
may
touting
his
vision
for
increased
security
and
enforcement
while
calling
for
some
sort
of
earned
legalization
for
the
millions
of
otherwise
lawabiding
individuals
who
live
and
work
in
the
us
without
authorization
the
house
and
senate
have
both
passed
immigration
reform
bills
on
dec
16
2005
reps
charles
bass
and
jeb
bradley
voted
in
favor
of
hr
4437
the
straightforwardly
titled
border
protection
antiterrorism
and
illegal
immigration
control
act
of
2005
the
bill
focuses
entirely
on
border
security
and
enforcement
measures
creating
an
unworkable
system
that
criminalizes
the
more
than
12
million
undocumented
persons
currently
in
the
us
in
contrast
on
may
25
the
senate
passed
s
2611
the
comprehensive
immigration
reform
act
of
2006
that
bill
seeks
to
establish
a
much
more
balanced
approach
to
immigration
and
has
the
support
of
the
white
house
sen
judd
gregg
voted
in
favor
of
the
bill
while
sen
john
e
sununu
was
opposed
given
the
wide
chasm
between
the
two
bills
house
and
senate
negotiators
were
to
have
spent
the
summer
in
conference
seeking
to
bridge
the
gaps
through
communication
and
compromise
the
electorate
expected
good
faith
negotiations
to
result
in
meaningful
reform
in
whats
become
a
recurring
theme
the
electorate
has
been
disappointed
instead
of
addressing
immigration
reform
head
on
the
house
has
embarked
upon
a
road
show
a
charade
which
will
likely
postpone
any
vote
on
immigration
reform
until
well
after
the
november
elections
lest
anyone
question
whether
the
hearings
are
oriented
towards
promoting
a
particular
antiimmigration
reform
agenda
bear
in
mind
that
the
aug
1
hearing
in
san
diego
was
entitled
how
does
illegal
immigration
impact
american
taxpayers
and
will
the
reidkennedy
amnesty
worsen
the
blow
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
rep
james
sensenbrenner
opened
the
san
diego
hearing
by
explaining
that
the
purpose
of
the
days
discussion
was
to
discern
the
impact
that
illegal
immigration
has
on
the
pocketbooks
of
americans
on
the
taxes
that
we
all
have
to
pay
and
the
benefits
that
the
government
can
afford
to
give
us
rep
sensenbrenner
then
added
that
the
committee
would
also
examine
whether
the
senate
bills
mass
amnesty
will
cost
us
even
more
in
light
of
the
hearing
name
and
the
chairmans
comments
its
fair
to
ask
whether
the
hearings
seek
to
treat
this
issue
in
a
fair
and
balanced
way
or
simply
foment
an
usvsthem
mentality
these
hearings
stem
from
coldly
calculated
tactics
designed
to
create
the
appearance
of
engagement
in
the
democratic
process
while
doing
nothing
more
than
trying
to
solidify
the
entrenched
opinions
of
the
immigration
obstructionist
wing
of
the
republican
party
one
of
these
sham
hearings
is
coming
to
town
at
10
am
on
aug
24
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
border
security
and
claims
will
hold
just
such
a
hearing
in
concord
with
the
republican
hold
on
the
house
in
clear
jeopardy
a
number
of
stalwarts
continue
to
milk
the
bases
breadandbutter
issues
terrorism
homosexuals
and
immigration
not
only
with
an
eye
on
the
general
election
but
also
in
many
cases
to
survive
strong
primary
challenges
from
more
moderate
opponents
the
hearings
thus
far
have
been
marked
by
handpicked
audiences
opposed
to
immigration
reform
to
the
exclusion
of
opposing
viewpoints
rather
than
engage
in
an
honest
open
discussion
about
this
countrys
longbroken
immigration
system
republican
house
leadership
is
putting
on
a
show
to
keep
the
issue
alive
long
enough
to
get
a
few
more
angry
voters
to
the
polls
while
the
speakers
list
for
the
aug
24
hearing
has
not
yet
been
made
public
inquiries
from
immigration
reform
advocates
to
participate
in
the
hearing
have
been
soundly
rebuffed
these
transparent
issuedodging
shenanigans
are
shocking
and
they
offend
our
most
basic
democratic
principles
it
is
up
to
each
and
every
one
of
us
regardless
of
what
we
believe
about
immigration
reform
to
let
our
congressional
representatives
know
that
ducking
hard
questions
for
purely
political
purposes
is
unacceptable
so
write
call
email
send
a
smoke
signal
or
actually
come
to
the
aug
24
hearing
but
be
sure
to
let
your
representatives
know
that
you
want
a
good
faith
discussion
and
true
action
on
immigration
reform
and
that
you
want
it
