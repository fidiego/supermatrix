americas
new
immigration
law
seems
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
world
   the
new
law
signed
last
month
by
president
bush
sanctions
a
35
percent
increase
in
the
number
of
immigrants
starting
next
year
that
will
allow
700000
people
a
year
to
enter
america
from
1995
the
number
of
immigrants
will
level
off
to
675000
a
year
   the
law
along
with
recent
changes
in
canadas
immigration
law
will
make
possible
the
immigration
of
nearly
1million
people
every
year
to
north
america
from
other
parts
of
the
world
   the
bulk
of
americas
immigrants
as
always
will
be
relatives
of
us
citizens
and
residents
and
that
number
remains
near
500000
a
year
but
theres
a
new
effort
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
newcomers
by
dramatically
increasing
the
number
of
visas
granted
to
highly
skilled
workers
and
investors
the
current
level
of
54000
visas
for
skilled
workers
like
doctors
engineers
professors
and
entrepreneurs
will
be
raised
to
140000
a
year
   the
significant
change
is
that
there
are
more
visas
for
immigrants
who
want
to
come
because
they
have
skills
an
educational
background
or
the
financial
capability
to
offer
something
to
america
said
duke
austin
a
spokesman
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ins
in
washington
   until
now
90
percent
of
immigration
has
been
based
on
family
unification
austin
said
   the
new
law
hasnt
eroded
the
idea
of
bringing
together
families
its
just
increased
the
share
of
others
by
increasing
the
overall
quota
   although
a
broad
limit
exists
on
immigration
its
a
pierceable
cap
there
is
no
limitation
on
immediate
relatives
of
american
citizens
   
the
new
law
marks
the
fourth
historic
change
in
americas
immigration
policy
since
the
nations
founding
despite
americas
longstanding
image
as
a
cosmopolitan
mecca
of
opportunity
its
immigration
policies
have
traditionally
tried
to
keep
out
all
but
europeans
   laws
such
as
the
chinese
exclusion
act
were
passed
to
keep
out
nonwhite
immigrants
and
other
people
thought
equally
undesirable
prostitutes
criminals
and
the
mentally
ill
   equal
opportunity
for
immigration
was
granted
only
in
1965
when
the
last
major
change
was
made
that
law
opened
doors
to
all
nations
and
ethnic
groups
and
instituted
family
ties
as
the
basis
for
immigration
   the
new
law
upholds
family
unification
as
the
linchpin
of
americas
immigration
policy
and
for
the
first
time
institutes
a
substantial
reward
for
skilled
migrants
a
system
that
is
already
in
place
in
australia
and
canada
to
attract
qualified
citizens
     
among
the
visas
granted
to
skilled
workers
10000
will
be
given
to
investors
who
are
willing
to
spend
at
least
1million
to
set
up
businesses
that
create
jobs
for
at
least
10
americans
   onethird
of
such
visas
are
to
go
to
people
who
are
willing
to
locate
businesses
in
rural
areas
or
areas
of
high
unemployment
   curiously
the
aflcio
a
national
federation
of
workers
unions
supported
the
overall
increase
in
immigration
but
opposed
the
giving
of
visas
to
such
job
creators
its
the
concept
of
buying
a
visa
that
were
against
said
jane
ogrady
a
legislative
assistant
   the
new
law
also
scraps
some
older
rules
one
of
them
a
mccarthyera
provision
the
mccarranwalter
act
has
denied
even
visitor
visas
to
more
than
350000
people
whom
the
administration
believed
were
subversive
or
leftist
the
list
has
included
novelists
graham
greene
and
gabriel
garcia
marquez
and
actor
yves
montand
   the
earlier
law
also
specifically
barred
entry
to
homosexuals
polygamists
and
people
with
aids
but
the
new
law
doesnt
categorically
do
so
but
terrorists
spies
drug
traffickers
communists
criminals
and
former
nazis
are
still
prohibited
from
coming
into
the
united
states
and
can
be
deported
     
although
there
is
no
longer
a
blanket
ban
on
people
with
different
political
beliefs
the
secretary
of
state
can
still
deny
admission
to
people
whose
ideas
he
decides
are
dangerous
to
americas
foreign
policy
   the
immigration
law
also
has
a
new
provision
that
resurrects
a
preferential
quota
for
immigrants
from
europe
because
85
percent
of
recent
immigrants
come
from
asia
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
to
join
spouses
children
or
siblings
already
in
the
united
states
the
new
law
has
been
amended
to
make
immigration
easier
for
people
from
38
other
countries
mostly
in
europe
who
may
wish
to
come
to
america
but
have
no
immediate
kin
in
this
country
to
sponsor
them
   a
yearly
total
of
40000
people
from
nations
such
as
ireland
italy
britain
germany
japan
poland
albania
algeria
and
venezuela
will
benefit
from
this
special
quota
   the
largest
beneficiaries
of
this
reform
are
irish
for
the
purpose
of
immigration
under
this
category
ireland
and
northern
ireland
will
be
regarded
as
separate
countries
and
up
to
16000
irish
immigrants
will
be
allowed
each
year
under
this
quota
   some
citizens
of
hong
kong
will
also
benefit
from
the
new
law
their
annual
immigration
quota
will
be
raised
from
5000
to
10000
a
year
and
hong
kong
a
british
crown
colony
that
is
to
become
a
part
of
china
in
1997
will
be
treated
as
a
separate
country
for
purposes
of
immigration
to
america
   another
12000
visas
a
year
will
be
granted
until
1994
to
highlevel
executives
of
large
american
corporations
operating
in
hong
kong
to
prevent
them
from
emigrating
to
other
nations
with
liberal
immigration
policies
   the
immigration
quota
doesnt
include
the
131000
refugees
who
will
also
come
to
america
this
year
mostly
from
indochina
and
the
soviet
union
refugees
have
to
prove
they
have
a
wellfounded
fear
of
persecution
in
their
countries
before
they
can
come
to
america
and
live
permanently
said
pam
lewis
a
state
department
spokeswoman
   the
changes
in
immigration
law
reflect
how
far
americas
gatekeeping
policies
have
come
since
the
nation
was
settled
by
europe
until
1965
it
was
aimed
at
excluding
entire
groups
of
people
based
on
ethnicity
said
david
ray
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
in
washington
his
group
believes
america
can
absorb
no
more
newcomers
and
favors
halting
immigration
from
all
parts
of
the
world
   early
immigrants
to
america
came
from
northern
and
western
europe
and
there
were
practically
no
restrictions
on
their
numbers
a
1790
law
provided
that
any
free
white
man
of
good
moral
character
could
become
a
citizen
after
hed
lived
in
america
for
more
than
two
years
said
carl
haub
a
demographer
at
the
population
reference
bureau
a
washington
research
group
   but
when
immigration
policies
were
later
crafted
they
were
restrictive
the
first
significant
immigration
policy
was
enacted
by
congress
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
to
virtually
ban
asian
particularly
chinese
immigration
after
rioters
accused
chinese
laborers
of
stealing
jobs
   when
the
chinese
exclusion
act
was
passed
in
1882
there
were
39000
chinese
haub
said
mostly
laborers
building
americas
railroads
that
was
the
peak
of
chinese
arrivals
at
that
time
but
it
wasnt
that
much
if
you
compared
it
to
the
250000
germans
who
came
in
the
same
year
subsequent
laws
kept
out
immigrants
from
other
asian
nations
the
ban
on
chinese
immigration
wasnt
lifted
until
1943
when
china
fought
on
americas
side
in
world
war
ii
   in
1924
another
law
was
enacted
to
restrict
the
number
of
immigrants
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
after
studies
pointed
out
such
immigrants
were
racially
inferior
criminally
inclined
and
didnt
assimilate
into
america
haub
said
that
law
decreed
82
percent
of
immigrants
could
come
from
northern
and
western
europe
and
only
16
percent
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
only
2
percent
of
immigrants
could
come
from
the
eastern
hemisphere
but
literacy
tests
not
applied
to
europeans
and
other
prohibitions
effectively
kept
out
asians
   a
landmark
change
was
adopted
in
1965
since
then
national
origin
has
been
immaterial
anybody
who
came
to
america
and
became
a
citizen
or
permanent
resident
could
invite
his
or
her
family
to
also
become
americans
parents
spouses
children
brothers
and
sisters
   today
the
largest
traffic
of
immigrants
comes
not
from
europe
but
from
mexico
20
percent
the
philippines
vietnam
korea
india
china
the
dominican
republic
jamaica
iran
and
el
salvador
   still
immigration
in
the
1980s
has
broken
some
records
too
austin
said
the
legalization
of
3million
illegal
immigrants
in
1986
swelled
the
decades
total
to
10million
in
contrast
not
more
than
6million
people
have
immigrated
to
america
in
any
decade
except
between
1900
and
1910
when
nearly
9million
immigrants
arrived
   and
despite
the
1986
amnesty
there
are
4million
illegal
aliens
living
in
the
united
states
some
americans
believe
that
the
country
can
absorb
no
more
newcomers
and
should
drastically
reduce
or
completely
halt
immigration
   this
is
no
longer
a
nation
that
is
being
formed
and
filled
said
john
vinson
an
official
of
the
american
immigration
control
foundation
in
monterey
va
a
group
that
favors
curtailing
immigration
when
you
build
a
house
you
may
need
a
crew
of
carpenters
and
plumbers
but
once
its
built
you
dont
need
those
kinds
of
services
every
day
of
the
week
   americas
population
increases
by
1
percent
every
year
adding
23million
people
said
haub
of
the
population
research
group
immigration
accounts
for
a
quarter
of
this
increase
   fair
the
group
that
advocates
halting
immigration
maintains
that
familyoriented
quotas
have
brought
in
immigrants
who
are
more
likely
to
be
unemployed
and
depend
on
welfare
   the
fault
isnt
in
the
immigrants
but
in
the
way
we
selected
them
said
ray
the
groups
spokesman
we
designed
a
nepotistic
system
and
were
paying
for
it
if
the
immigrants
of
the
1980s
had
all
been
skilled
americas
national
income
would
be
12billion
more
every
year
ray
said
citing
a
study
   but
others
say
immigration
is
a
part
of
americas
heritage
and
isnt
burdensome
past
immigrants
to
america
came
to
seek
refuge
from
causes
that
were
little
different
they
fled
poverty
persecution
and
the
wars
of
europe
and
they
were
joined
by
families
who
were
often
illiterate
and
unskilled
poverty
is
no
longer
accepted
as
a
valid
reason
for
coming
to
america
but
new
immigrants
come
to
join
relatives
or
have
been
displaced
by
fighting
in
vietnam
and
central
america
   the
people
who
come
to
america
have
to
prove
that
they
or
their
sponsor
can
support
them
and
they
wont
become
a
charge
of
the
state
said
haub
of
the
population
reference
bureau
refugees
are
the
only
newcomers
who
depend
on
social
services
   the
aflcio
has
always
had
a
proimmigration
position
said
spokeswoman
jane
ogrady
some
recent
literature
has
pointed
out
that
americans
have
spent
more
on
welfare
and
been
displaced
by
jobs
lost
to
newcomers
but
illegal
immigration
is
the
culprit
she
said
   our
view
is
that
all
the
workers
in
america
are
products
of
immigration
