local

leaders
expressed
optimism
monday
over
the
house
republicans
new
standards
for
immigration
reform
and
the
renewed
push
by
congress
to
overhaul
the
nations
outdated
immigration
laws
the
nations
laws
need
to
track
with
the
reality
of
the
world
we
live
in
today
said
salt

county
mayor
ben
mcadams
during
a
conference
call
monday
which
was
sponsored
by
the
proimmigration
reform
organizations
the
partnership
for
a

economy
and
bibles
badges
and
business
what
we
know
as
we
look
at
this
issue
from
the
local
level
is
that
any
solution
needs
has
to
be
federally
driven
our
country
and
community
will
be
stronger
if
were
able
to
come
to
consensus
on
immigration
reform
in
a
way
where
we
recognize
the
effect
immigration
has
on
our
businesses
the
importance
of
strengthening
families
and
that
includes
immigrant
families
but
also
recognizes
we
need
to
have
enforcement
mcadams
said
the
standards
released
late
last
week
emphasize
border
enforcement
and
employment
verification
but
call
for
humane
treatment
of
youths
brought
to
the
united
states
by
parents
who
were
not
authorized
to
be
in
the
country
the
senate
passed
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
last
year
but
the
effort
stalled
in
the
house
house
leaders
prefer
to
address
multiple
bills
that
address
the
issue
on
a
piecemeal
basis
the
rev
steve
klemz
pastor
of
zion
evangelical
lutheran
church
in
salt
lake
city
said
faith
leaders
are
incredibly
encouraged
by
the
republican
initiative
to
set
forth
some
principles
to
get
immigration
back
on
track
personally
the
rev
klemz
said
he
believes
it
is
important
for
congress
to
address
the
nations
immigration
policies
because
they
reflect
the
very
being
and
core
of
who
we
are
as
a
nation
the
rev
klemz
said
he
and
his
wife
have
been
to
immigration
court
twice
in
the
past
12
years
to
petition
for
her
green
card
twice
we
have
been
refused
a
green
card
we
are
in
limbo
living
not
only
in
fear
of
deportation
but
in
limbo
of
administrative
hold
he
said
the
six
standards
for
immigration
reform
include
border
security
and
interior
enforcement
a
visa
tracking
system
employment
verification
and
workplace
enforcement
reforms
to
the
legal
immigration
system
youth
but
no
special
path
to
citizenship
for
people
who
broke
immigration
laws
stan
lockhart
former
chairman
of
the
utah
republican
party
and
government
affairs
manager
for
micron
said
passing
sensible
immigration
reform
would
honor
the
ideals
upon
which
the
nation
was
founded
if
you
read
the
declaration
of
independence
they
talk
about
the
godgiven
rights
of
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
theyre
guaranteed
to
all
men
and
women
wherever
they
might
be
essentially
i
believe
a
sensible
immigration
system
enshrines
those
rights
for
all
those
people
lockhart
said
for
businesses
immigration
reform
would
provide
clarity
for
employers
and
help
ensure
welleducated
college
graduates
from
other
nations
could
remain
in
the
united
states
to
put
their
knowledge
and
innovation
to
work
most
important
to
us
is
reforming
the
legal
immigration
system
so
that
those
foreign
nationals
who
come
to
the
united
states
and
study
and
are
ready
to
come
out
and
help
build
businesses
arent
pushed
away
and
can
come
work
for
growing
american
companies

jonathan
johnson
executive
vice
chairman
of
overstockcom
overstockcom
for

needs
mathematicians
statisticians
and
people
with
technology
degrees
its
so
hard
to
hire
the
best
and
brightest
coming
out
our
of
our
great
universities
under
our
current
immigration
system
other
countries
realize
this
and
are
working
to
recruit
those
americantrained
phds
to
come
to
their
countries
and
create
competition
for
usbased
businesses
he
said
meanwhile
lane
beattie
president
and
ceo
of
the
salt
lake
chamber
said
the
house
republicans
principles
represent
bold
leadership
on
a
complex
issue
utah
has
helped
lead
this
discussion
because
we
know
immigration
reform
will
grow
our
economy
and
provide
predictability
that
businesses
need
we
are
encouraged
by
the
developments
and
