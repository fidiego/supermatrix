president
obama
said
early
thursday
that
he
wants
to
make
a
major
push
to
have
congress
pass
immigration
legislation
this
year
but
by
late
in
the
day
the
white
house
was
confirming
he
will
nominate
someone
with
little
immigration
experience
to
head
the
department
of
homeland
security
administration
and
congressional
officials
said
mr
obama
will
turn
to
jeh
johnson
who
was
the
top
lawyer
at
the
pentagon
to
run
the
agency
that
oversees
the
secret
service
the
transportation
security
administration
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
and
all
three
immigration
services
the
president
is
selecting
johnson
because
he
is
one
the
most
highly
qualified
and
respected
national
security
leaders
having
served
as
the
senior
lawyer
for
the
largest
government
agency
in
the
world
a
white
house
aide
said
a
nomination
could
come
friday
for
the
job
which
many
observers
say
is
the
toughest
in
washington
getting
battered
from
all
sides
on
issues
of
privacy
and
security
and
on
how
strenuously
the
department
is
enforcing
immigration
laws
with
the
end
of
the
government
shutdown
mr
obama
has
elevated
immigration
to
the
top
of
his
legislative
agenda
saying
thursday
that
he
will
pressure
house
republicans
to
pass
a
bill
following
the
lead
of
the
senate
which
passed
one
in
june
this
can
and
should
get
done
by
the
end
of
this
year
he
said
adding
that
he
expected
it
to
be
an
area
of
cooperation
with
the
gop
some
key
republicans
though
said
judging
by
the
way
the
president
refused
to
negotiate
with
them
during
the
spending
and
debt
fights
hes
squandered
any
chance
to
work
with
them
now
i
think
it
would
be
crazy
for
the
house
republican
leadership
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
him
on
immigration
and
im
a
proponent
of
immigration
reform
rep
raul
r
labrador
idaho
republican
said
wednesday
hes
trying
to
destroy
the
republican
party
and
i
think
that
anything
that
we
do
right
now
with
the
president
on
immigration
will
be
with
that
same
goal
in
mind
which
is
to
destroy
the
republican
party
and
not
to
get
good
policy
where
the
senate
passed
a
broad
bill
combining
more
spending
on
border
security
with
a
revamp
of
the
legal
immigration
system
and
a
legalization
program
for
those
in
the
country
illegally
house
republican
leaders
have
said
they
will
tackle
the
issue
in
pieces
speaking
alongside
mr
labrador
at
the
heritage
foundation
on
wednesday
rep
matt
salmon
arizona
republican
said
he
had
been
promised
by
house
speaker
john
a
boehner
that
the
house
will
not
go
to
conference
committee
to
work
out
differences
with
the
senate
on
a
big
bill
only
on
the
small
pieces
a
spokesman
for
mr
boehner
said
the
speaker
was
reiterating
his
longstanding
support
for
a
stepbystep
process
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
key
to
the
house
gops
efforts
will
be
a
bill
to
legalize
younger
illegal
immigrants
known
as
dreamers
house
majority
leader
eric
cantor
of
virginia
is
trying
to
write
that
bill
along
with
rep
bob
goodlatte
virginia
republican
and
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
mr
johnsons
nomination
will
help
renew
the
immigration
debate
though
his
experience
with
the
issue
seems
limited
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
indication
that
he
has
any
experience
at
all
in
immigration
said
rosemary
jenks
chief
lobbyist
for
numbersusa
which
advocates
for
stricter
immigration
limits
indeed
reaction
from
either
side
of
the
immigration
debate
was
muted
as
everyone
tried
to
figure
out
what
to
make
of
mr
johnson
one
tantalizing
tidbit
appeared
in
a
short
crains
new
york
business
profile
in
the
1990s
noting
that
during
his
time
as
a
young
justice
department
lawyer
he
prosecuted
corrupt
politicians
cops
and
immigration
agents
that
might
not
sit
well
with
immigration
agents
already
bristling
at
what
many
argue
is
an
administration
that
has
chosen
to
turn
an
eye
on
illegal
immigration
while
prosecuting
border
patrol
agents
for
excessive
violence
sen
jeff
sessions
an
alabama
republican
who
fought
the
senates
immigration
bill
questioned
whether
mr
johnson
is
the
right
man
to
reform
the
immigration
services
it
would
appear
that
the
president
plans
to
nominate
a
loyalist
and
fundraiser
to
this
post
this
is
deeply
concerning
he
said
this
huge
department
must
have
a
proven
manager
with
strong
relevant
law
enforcement
experience
recognized
independence
and
integrity
who
can
restore
this
department
to
its
full
capability
but
mr
johnson
earned
words
of
encouragement
from
several
key
lawmakers
including
house
homeland
security
committee
chairman
michael
t
mccaul
texas
republican
and
senate
homeland
security
and
governmental
affairs
chairman
thomas
r
carper
delaware
democrat
mr
johnson
brings
a
wealth
of
experience
from
the
department
of
defense
and
i
am
eager
to
meet
with
him
and
discuss
his
vision
mr
carper
said
even
if
mr
johnson
is
confirmed
it
will
still
leave
major
gaps
at
the
department
and
in
the
three
immigration
services
in
particular
us
customs
and
border
protection
and
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
the
two
immigration
lawenforcement
branches
are
without
chiefs
meanwhile
the
head
of
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
which
administers
immigration
benefits
has
been
tapped
to
be
the
homeland
security
departments
deputy
secretary
but
his
nomination
has
been
tied
to
a
political
scandal
involving
virginia
democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
terry
mcauliffe
with
the
growing
threat
of
al
qaedaaffiliated
groups
in
africa
mr
johnsons
nomination
could
get
some
pushback
from
senate
republicans
for
his
views
that
the
terrorist
network
is
rapidly
deteriorating
i
do
believe
that
on
the
present
course
there
will
come
a
tipping
point
mr
johnson
said
in
a
speech
at
oxford
university
late
last
year
a
tipping
point
at
which
so
many
of
the
leaders
and
operatives
of
al
qaeda
and
its
affiliates
have
been
killed
or
captured
such
that
al
qaeda
as
we
know
it
the
organization
that
our
congress
authorized
the
military
to
pursue
in
2001
has
been
effectively
destroyed
