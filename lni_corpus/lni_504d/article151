the
kansas
city
star
fierce
partisans
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
would
do
well
to
take
a
breather
some
of
the
harshest
measures
of
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
have
been
halted
by
an
injunction
us
district
judge
susan
bolton
forbade
the
state
from
requiring
police
officers
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
those
they
stop
or
arrest
thus
begins
what
promises
to
be
a
protracted
fight
in
federal
courts
now
if
only
people
would
stop
spitting
fire
long
enough
to
realize
what
this
offers
the
nation
an
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
problem
and
come
up
with
a
good
solution
we
can
steer
clear
of
the
haphazard
reactionary
and
often
prejudiced
immigration
policies
of
our
nations
past
let
the
skittish
politicians
finish
the
primary
and
general
elections
full
of
tough
talk
eventually
congress
will
take
up
immigration
reform
in
earnest
once
the
pressures
of
campaign
season
are
gone
perhaps
decisionmaking
on
this
vital
matter
will
be
guided
by
sobering
reality
we
can
get
it
right
this
time
to
do
so
we
need
to
take
into
account
not
only
the
obvious
need
to
police
our
borders
but
also
to
address
humanely
the
10
million
people
here
illegally
whom
we
have
no
realistic
chance
of
deporting
and
who
play
a
large
role
in
our
economy
speaking
of
which
any
immigration
reform
must
account
for
future
labor
needs
finding
a
way
to
meet
them
that
is
consistent
with
enforceable
law
heres
another
reason
we
need
to
think
carefully
and
come
up
with
a
comprehensive
solution
immigration
policies
and
enforcement
measures
have
a
way
of
solving
one
problem
while
causing
another
arizonas
immigration
issues
developed
largely
after
crackdowns
near
san
diego
pushed
border
crossings
further
east
one
result
the
morgue
in
tucson
is
full
of
dead
migrants
as
the
summers
heat
peaks
such
horrific
facts
are
part
of
the
latest
chapter
in
our
long
often
lessthanstellar
immigration
history
how
do
we
want
that
history
to
read
to
future
generations
skirmishes
with
nativist
vigilantes
states
and
municipalities
jumping
onboard
with
draconian
laws
that
wont
pass
constitutional
muster
and
ever
more
fear
and
exploitation
as
basic
human
rights
are
stripped
from
illegal
immigrants
those
who
complain
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
nothing
are
wrong
about
1200
national
guard
members
are
headed
to
the
southern
border
joining
the
largest
force
of
border
agents
ever
stationed
there
and
deportations
have
reached
levels
seen
under
the
bush
administration
and
remember
that
illegal
immigration
peaked
years
ago
before
the
us
economy
went
sour
we
tend
to
deport
newer
immigrants
in
times
of
ethnic
fear
and
economic
hardship
the
first
to
go
were
the
chinese
after
race
riots
in
several
western
states
in
the
1870s
and
1880s
later
congress
banned
their
entry
altogether
a
big
thank
you
for
their
labor
in
building
the
railroads
during
the
great
depression
the
government
rounded
up
not
only
mexicans
but
us
citizens
of
mexican
descent
and
sent
them
packing
the
history
of
us
immigration
policy
records
many
instances
of
getting
tough
but
rarely
has
the
nation
dealt
effectively
with
its
current
immigration
and
labor
challenges
and
also
prepared
for
the
future
if
the
arizona
law
goes
to
the
us
supreme
court
it
may
turn
on
this
question
is
immigration
solely
a
federal
issue
or
should
states
now
have
a
role
in
her
injunction
bolton
argued
that
the
enforcement
called
for
by
the
law
would
overwhelm
federal
immigration
authorities
that
in
my
opinion
gets
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
are
we
interested
in
sensible
immigration
reform
that
actually
creates
a
better
system
or
are
we
interested
in
gettough
gestures
that
create
more
problems
elsewhere
the
usmexico
border
has
no
statute
of
liberty
asking
for
your
tired
your
poor
no
ellis
island
for
future
generations
to
romanticize
and
yet
the
migrants
who
traversed
that
border
in
the
massive
wave
of
the
past
few
decades
they
are
now
part
of
the
united
states
like
it
or
not
their
children
and
now
their
childrens
children
are
reshaping
the
nations
demographics
how
do
we
want
their
chapter
of
us
history
to
read
