this
week
the
new
democratic
congress
began
debating
an
immigration
reform
bill
aimed
at
curbing
illegal
immigration
if
democratic
leaders
can
work
with
president
bush
and
their
republican
counterparts
to
enact
comprehensive
immigration
reform
one
of
the
most
vexing
issues
facing
our
country
could
be
solved
few
people
on
either
side
of
the
immigration
debate
are
happy
with
the
status
quo
today
an
estimated
12
million
foreignborn
people
live
in
the
united
states
without
authorization
with
the
number
growing
by
half
a
million
each
year
those
immigrants
fill
an
important
growing
gap
in
the
us
labor
market
our
economy
creates
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
each
year
for
lowerskilled
workers
in
such
sectors
as
cleaning
food
preparation
landscaping
and
retail
at
the
same
time
the
pool
of
americans
who
have
traditionally
filled
such
jobs
continues
to
shrink
as
nativeborn
workers
become
on
average
older
and
better
educated
yet
our
immigration
system
offers
no
legal
channel
for
peaceful
hardworking
if
lowskilled
workers
to
enter
the
country
to
fill
those
jobs
largescale
illegal
immigration
will
end
only
when
americas
immigration
system
offers
a
legal
alternative
when
given
the
choice
of
paying
a
smuggler
2000
risking
robbery
and
death
in
the
desert
and
living
a
shadowy
existence
in
the
underground
us
economy
unable
to
leave
and
return
freely
to
visit
home
or
entering
the
united
states
through
a
port
of
entry
with
legal
documents
enjoying
the
full
responsibility
and
protection
of
the
law
and
the
freedom
to
visit
home
without
fear
of
being
denied
reentry
the
large
majority
of
potential
entrants
will
chose
the
legal
path
we
know
from
experience
that
legal
immigration
if
allowed
will
crowd
out
illegal
immigration
in
the
1950s
the
bracero
program
allowed
mexican
workers
to
enter
the
country
temporarily
typically
to
work
on
farms
in
the
southwest
early
in
that
decade
illegal
immigration
was
widespread
because
the
program
offered
an
insufficient
number
of
visas
to
meet
the
labor
demands
of
a
growing
us
economy
instead
of
merely
redoubling
efforts
to
enforce
a
flawed
law
congress
dramatically
increased
the
number
of
visas
to
accommodate
demand
the
result
apprehensions
of
illegal
entrants
at
the
border
dropped
by
more
than
95
percent
if
the
goal
is
to
curb
illegal
immigration
any
temporary
worker
program
must
offer
a
sufficient
number
of
visas
to
meet
the
legitimate
demands
of
a
growing
us
labor
market
the
fact
that
400000
to
500000
foreignborn
workers
join
the
us
labor
force
illegally
each
year
indicates
the
general
magnitude
of
how
much
demand
exceeds
the
supply
of
available
legal
workers
a
temporary
worker
program
should
offer
at
least
that
number
of
visas
to
allow
the
revealed
demand
of
american
employers
to
be
met
legally
to
be
effective
an
expanded
visa
program
must
also
be
flexible
enough
to
respond
to
labormarket
signals
union
leaders
are
pressuring
democrats
to
require
that
temporary
workers
be
paid
prevailing
wages
that
is
artificially
high
unionlevel
wages
rather
than
market
wages
that
would
be
a
recipe
for
failure
since
many
of
the
jobs
filled
by
immigrant
workers
are
lowskilled
lowwage
jobs
that
would
simply
not
exist
in
the
legal
economy
if
unionlevel
wages
were
mandated
adding
cumbersome
labor
rules
will
only
perpetuate
the
underground
labor
market
that
has
been
created
by
the
current
system
demands
for
restrictive
wage
rules
are
based
on
false
fears
that
increased
legal
immigration
will
drive
down
the
wages
and
working
conditions
for
a
broad
swath
of
american
workers
but
only
a
small
and
declining
share
of
the
american
workforce
competes
against
immigrant
workers
according
to
the
new
americans
the
authoritative
1997
national
research
council
study
of
immigration
the
only
two
groups
of
americans
who
face
downward
wage
pressure
from
immigration
are
other
recent
immigrants
and
nativeborn
americans
without
a
high
school
diploma
the
wage
impact
on
american
workers
is
small
the
weight
of
the
empirical
evidence
suggests
that
the
impact
of
immigration
on
the
wages
of
competing
nativeborn
workers
is
smallpossibly
reducing
them
by
only
1
or
2
percent
the
nrc
study
concluded
more
recent
studies
confirm
the
small
impact
of
lowskilled
immigration
on
competing
american
workers
if
congress
fails
to
reform
americas
immigration
laws
in
a
way
that
reflects
the
reality
of
our
market
economy
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
will
only
grow
worse
without
comprehensive
immigration
reform
congress
and
the
administration
will
waste
billions
of
dollars
more
trying
to
enforce
an
unenforceable
law
