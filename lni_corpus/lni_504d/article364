rcmp
constable
howard
adams
said
the
investigation
began
two
years
ago
with
a
tip
from
a
metro
toronto
police
asian
crime
unit
that
had
received
an
anonymous
letter
outlining
complaints
regarding
the
immigration
consulting
business
rcmp
investigators
pursued
the
tip
and
found
that
a
person
wanted
to
meet
a
dishonest
immigration
officer
who
would
be
willing
either
to
provide
him
with
immigration
documents
or
to
help
him
speed
clients
through
the
immigration
process
for
the
investigation
the
immigration
minister
designated
an
undercover
rcmp
member
to
act
as
an
immmigration
officer
constable
adams
said
further
charges
are
anticipated
as
a
result
of
information
gleaned
from
searches
executed
yesterday
definitely
there
will
more
charges
under
the
criminal
code
and
the
immigration
act
he
said
the
case
is
important
constable
adams
said
because
it
focuses
attention
on
the
unregulated
activities
of
immigration
consultants
a
lot
of
people
are
paying
exorbitant
prices
to
some
of
these
immigration
consultants
in
order
to
get
into
canada
he
said
and
were
finding
that
some
of
these
consultants
are
willing
to
use
whatever
means
possible
to
circumvent
the
system
the
immigration
act
allows
the
federal
government
to
regulate
immigration
consultants
but
rules
to
control
their
activity
and
qualifications
have
never
been
promulgated
as
a
result
anyone
can
call
himself
or
herself
an
immigration
consultant
and
charge
whatever
fees
he
or
she
likes
for
advice
the
provision
to
regulate
consultants
was
put
in
the
act
after
repeated
complaints
about
the
lack
of
qualifications
and
supervision
of
some
immigration
consultants
some
consultants
are
highly
qualified
having
worked
for
either
the
immigration
department
or
foreign
affairs
department
others
have
no
training
or
experience
in
immigration
mendel
green
a
prominent
torontobased
immigration
lawyer
with
a
large
chinese
clientele
said
in
an
interview
yesterday
that
bar
associations
and
the
law
society
of
upper
canada
have
long
advocated
the
regulation
of
immigration
consultants
unlike
immigration
consultants
mr
green
said
lawyers
are
required
to
deposit
client
retainers
in
a
trust
account
until
services
have
been
performed
and
billed
as
well
he
said
lawyers
are
subject
to
professional
discipline
a
lawyer
could
be
charged
criminally
today
fined
lose
his
licence
to
practice
law
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
could
call
himself
an
immigration
consultant
and
the
immigration
department
would
have
to
deal
with
him
and
give
him
status
on
a
clients
file
he
said
its
unbelievable
and
the
public
has
absolutely
no
protection
at
all
