hundreds
of
immigration
detainees
deemed
low
risk
have
been
released
part

a
national
game

the
move

citing
impending
budget
cuts
immigration
officials
have
announced
the
release
of
hundreds
of
detainees
considered
lowlevel
threats
to
public
safety
this
move
by
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
has
quickly
turned
into
one
of
the
most
baffling
chapters
in
the
publicrelations
chess
match
going
on
between
house
republicans
and
the
obama
white
house
over
the
looming
sequester
the
release
of
detainees
may
score
some
shortterm
points
for
president
obama
who
has
been
sending
dire
warnings
about
the
impact
of
the
cuts
including
with
a
speech
tuesday
at
a
virginia
shipyard
but
the
gop
could
also
strike
a
chord
with
americans
by
highlighting
security
concerns
and
other
issues
posed
by
the
release
and
such
concerns
could
bring
into
play
even
more
than
the
fight
over
federal
spending
deficits
and
the
debt
namely
the
release
of
detainees
could
also
affect
the
debate
over
comprehensive
immigration
reform
thats
important
because
the
gops
political
future
may
in
part
be
staked
on
potential
gains
that
the
party
can
make
with
hispanic
voters
mr
obama
too
could
lose
a
lot
if
immigration
reform
falters
its
natural
that
people
in
a
federal
organization
are
going
to
take
this
chance
to
prove
how
important
they
are
to
the
public
especially
as
that
goal
is
aligned
with
a
white
house
trying
to
raise
the
ante
over
the
spending
cuts
says
allert
browngort
an
immigration
expert
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
in
indiana
but
he
adds
this
also
points
to
some
of
the
questions
around
the
immigration
bill
right
now
including
how
serious
the
government
is
about
securing
the
usmexico
border
according
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
release
came
as
ice
prepared
for
the
sequester
which
is
set
to
kick
in
friday
and
which
mandates
automatic
cuts
from
nearly
all
corners
of
the
federal
bureaucracy
including
ices
205
billion
budget
in
announcing
the
release
ice
insisted
that
the
government
is
not
dropping
these
deportation
cases
the
agency
released
these
lowrisk
noncriminal
detainees
under
a
less
expensive
form
of
monitoring
to
ensure
detention
levels
stayed
within
ices
overall
budget
white
house
spokesman
jay
carney
said
wednesday
insisting
that
the
white
house
was
not
involved
in
the
decision
on
monday
dhs
secretary
janet
napolitano
a
member
of
the
obama
cabinet
offered
im
supposed
to
have
34000
beds
for
detainees
how
do
i
pay
for
those
we
want
to
maintain
some
22000
border
patrol
agents
ive
got
to
be
able
to
pay
their
salaries
currently
30000
immigration
scofflaws
are
housed
in
250
detention
facilities
nationwide
proimmigrant
activists
hailed
ices
move
calling
it
a
commonsense
approach
that
will
save
the
government
a
lot
of
money
they
also
cited
research
suggesting
that
those
enrolled
in
alternativetodetention
programs
which
include
gps
anklets
come
to
their
final
immigration
hearings
96
percent
of
the
time
more
broadly
however
59
percent
of
all
alleged
immigration
lawbreakers
who
are
not
detained
by
ice
fail
to
show
up
for
their
immigration
court
dates
critics
say
moreover
some
600000
illegal
immigrants
have
never
answered
deportation
letters
sent
to
them
by
ice
according
to
the
center
for
immigration
studies
cis
a
washington
think
tank
that
advocates
stronger
borders
and
tougher
immigration
enforcement
illegal
immigrants
are
by
definition
flight
risks
says
steven
camarota
research
director
at
the
center
so
far
polls
suggest
that
republicans
are
on
a
death
march
by
opposing
moves
like
eliminating
tax
loopholes
and
some
deductions
mr
browngort
says
earlier
this
week
louisiana
gov
bobby
jindal
r
complained
that
obama
is
trying
to
scare
the
american
people
by
ginning
up
potential
effects
from
the
sequester
which
really
puts
the
brakes
on
spending
growth
in
part
by
reducing
treasury
outlays
for
discretionary
spending
beyond
the
sequester
showdown
are
the
recent
moves
toward
immigration
reform
with
both
obama
and
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
notably
including
sen
marco
rubio
r
of
florida
outlining
proposals
that
move
illegal
immigrants
toward
legalization
in
that
light
the
obama
administration
could
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
criticism
over
releasing
lawbreakers
especially
if
any
of
those
detainees
cause
mayhem
that
makes
the
news
the
obama
administration
is
basically
saying
look
the
republicans
are
so
irresponsible
theyre
forcing
us
to
release
illegal
aliens
says
mr
camarota
at
cis
but
im
not
sure
this
particular
gambit
is
going
to
play
out
the
way
they
hope
obviously
theres
nothing
in
the
sequester
that
says
you
have
to
release
anybody
and
if
you
have
legalization
thats
predicated
on
a
promise
of
future
enforcement
and
this
shows
the
obama
administration
is
not
serious
about
enforcing
laws
rep
robert
goodlatte
r
of
virginia
whos
been
tasked
with
trying
to
find
a
compromise
path
for
immigration
reform
in
the
house
addressed
ices
move
at
a
wednesday
breakfast
with
reporters
sponsored
by
the
monitor
if
the
presidents
idea
of
how
to
manage
our
federal
government
is
to
release
thousands
of
people
who
have
been
detained
and
most
of
the
people
who
have
been
detained
are
not
just
illegally
present
in
the
united
states
but
theyve
committed
some
kind
of
a
criminal
act
in
addition
to
that
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
misguided
approach
to
how
you
save
money
in
that
agency
representative
goodlatte
said
according
to
the
new
york
times
several
highranking
republicans
shrugged
off
the
release
as
part
of
an
ongoing
number
of
administration
scare
tactics
designed
to
undermine
those
republicans
who
dont
mind
seeing
the
automatic
cuts
go
into
effect
the
situation
is
a
peek
into
the
gops
internecine
warfare
where
especially
tea
party
hardliners
on
spending
and
immigration
are
at
loggerheads
with
establishment
republicans
pushing
for
immigration
reform
and
a
sequester
deal
that
may
include
a
tax
hike
one
of
the
things
youve
got
right
now
is
that
the
gop
establishment
understands
that
theyve
got
to
get
something
done
on
immigration
which
is
why
theyre
taking
a
relatively
lowkey
approach
to
the
detainee
releases
browngort
says
they
dont
want
the
base
riled
up
on
this
right
now
they
need
them
to
be
quiet
it
may
be
too
late
in
arizona
pinal
county
sheriff
paul
babeu
said
on
npr
wednesday
morning
you
dont
have
to
be
a
detective
to
figure
out
that
likely
this
is
a
weapon
in
the
sequestration
fight
he
added
a
lot
of
criminal
illegals
were
released
onto
streets
and
neighborhoods
in
my
county
and
thats
not
ok
house
speaker
john
boehner
obamas
chief
adversary
in
the
sequester
debate
couldnt
hold
back
either
this
is
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
they
cant
find
cuts
elsewhere
in
their
agency
mr
boehner
said
on
cbs
tuesday
im
looking
for
more
facts
but
i
cant
believe
that
they
cant
find
the
kind
of
savings
they
need
out
of
that
department
short
of
letting
criminals
go
free
also
on
tuesday
the
senior
dhs
official
in
charge
of
arresting
and
deporting
illegal
immigrants
informed
his
staff
of
his
retirement
the
associated
press
reported
gary
mead
will
be
leaving
at
the
end
of
april
according
to
an
email
to
his
staff
that
was
obtained
by
ap
he
apparently
told
senior
dhs
leaders
several
weeks
ago
