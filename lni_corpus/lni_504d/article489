more
than
any
other
members
of
congress
senator
alan
k
simpson
and
representative
romano
l
mazzoli
have
fought
the
immigration
wars
and
when
they
reflect
on
more
than
a
decade
of
effort
both
speak
with
weary
despair
mr
mazzoli
a
democrat
from
kentucky
is
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
and
mr
simpson
a
republican
from
wyoming
is
the
ranking
minority
member
of
the
senate
counterpart
they
were
cosponsors
of
the
most
important
immigration
legislation
in
the
last
20
years
the
simpsonmazzoli
act
of
1986
and
now
both
men
say
they
have
come
to
the
disturbing
conclusion
that
congressional
oversight
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
just
does
not
work
most
members
of
congress
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
immigration
service
to
them
the
agency
is
political
poison
as
alfred
giugni
director
of
the
ins
office
in
el
paso
put
it
mr
simpson
and
mr
mazzoli
heartily
agreed
everything
about
it
is
negative
for
me
mr
mazzoli
said
mr
simpson
said
that
is
certainly
true
in
the
senate
as
well
the
problems
begin
when
they
try
to
recruit
other
members
to
serve
on
the
immigration
subcommittees
nobody
wants
to
do
it
a
member
would
have
to
take
two
or
three
long
gulps
before
they
would
say
yes
and
take
the
subcommittee
on
immigration
mr
mazzoli
said
you
have
to
virtually
shanghai
people
to
get
them
onto
this
thing
youve
got
to
dragoon
them
jerry
tinker
staff
director
of
the
senate
immigration
subcommittee
said
we
could
find
only
three
senators
who
were
willing
to
be
on
it
that
is
the
minimum
number
the
fundamental
problem
members
of
congress
say
is
that
the
nation
has
reached
no
consensus
about
how
to
handle
immigration
loud
lobbies
representing
large
segments
of
the
public
want
to
let
in
more
and
more
immigrants
other
large
lobbies
that
are
just
as
loud
want
to
put
up
fences
so
whatever
position
a
member
of
congress
takes
it
is
almost
certain
to
irritate
a
powerful
interest
group
mr
simpson
said
every
time
one
of
us
starts
talking
about
more
effective
immigration
controls
somebody
else
throws
up
the
statue
of
liberty
how
were
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
all
of
that
he
shook
his
head
the
debate
takes
on
tinges
of
racism
emotion
there
are
other
negatives
mr
mazzoli
said
since
my
race
for
reelection
in
1981
its
been
used
against
me
every
time
why
am
i
wasting
time
on
immigration
instead
of
helping
louisville
so
the
immigration
committees
are
pariahs
and
an
inevitable
result
is
that
congressional
oversight
is
largely
ineffectual
in
fact
mr
mazzoli
said
he
felt
no
political
pressure
from
the
public
or
elsewhere
in
government
to
create
an
efficient
uptosnuff
ins
when
the
chairmen
of
two
house
subcommittees
left
congress
in
1980
mr
mazzoli
was
given
a
choice
do
you
want
to
be
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
crime
or
the
subcommittee
on
immigration
i
could
have
made
that
choice
in
a
nanosecond
he
recalled
there
was
no
downside
to
crime
in
that
job
he
could
help
cities
hire
new
police
officers
take
credit
for
sending
dangerous
criminals
to
jail
and
there
was
no
upside
to
immigration
but
personal
entreaties
from
people
he
respected
persuaded
mr
mazzoli
to
take
the
immigration
subcommittee
he
sighed
as
he
discussed
his
efforts
to
solve
just
one
of
the
immigration
services
many
endemic
problems
so
here
we
are
14
years
later
at
about
the
same
place
mr
mazzoli
said
listening
to
that
ofttold
tale
of
things
that
were
going
to
get
done
that
never
got
done
