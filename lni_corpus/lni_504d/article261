the
states
growing
immigrant
population
especially
residents
from
mexico
and
latin
america
is
rapidly
changing
the
legal
landscape
for
the
states
attorneys
and
not
just
those
who
specialize
in
immigration
and
naturalization
law
in
recent
years
the
federal
government
has
aggressively
pushed
enforcement
of
its
immigration
measures
including
the
start
of
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
programs
in
three
north
carolina
counties
the
emphasis
on
enforcement
has
not
only
spiked
the
volume
of
cases
being
handled
by
the
states
immigration
lawyers
but
also
has
shown
how
frequently
immigration
issues
branch
out
into
areas
such
as
criminal
family
and
employment
law
no
matter
what
area
of
concentration
its
inevitable
that
more
attorneys
will
be
confronted
by
immigration
matters
in
the
coming
years
charlotte
lawyer
alan
gordon
said
this
makes
it
critical
that
attorneys
be
aware
of
the
intricacies
of
the
countrys
system
of
immigration
and
naturalization
laws
and
develop
an
awareness
of
the
wider
social
issues
that
surround
them
ive
always
been
passionate
about
education
and
thats
one
of
our
goals
to
get
more
information
out
to
the
public
the
press
and
the
bar
said
gordon
who
has
practiced
immigration
law
for
30
years
and
chaired
the
recently
released
mayors
immigration
commission
study
in
charlotte
we
need
to
get
more
information
out
about
the
complex
interaction
of
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
this
country
it
affects
people
in
the
united
states
and
thus
it
affects
lawyers
in
the
united
states
booming
population
north
carolina
boasts
the
eighth
highest
population
of
illegal
immigrants
in
the
country
with
an
estimated
300000
according
to
the
pew
hispanic
center
a
nonpartisan
research
organization
based
in
washington
dc
the
state
also
had
the
fastestgrowing
hispanic
population
in
the
country
during
the
last
decade
thus
when
the
department
of
homeland
security
created
its
ice
program
in
2003
acting
under
section
287g
of
the
1996
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigration
responsibility
act
north
carolina
was
a
prime
location
for
it
to
take
root
the
program
allows
ice
to
enter
agreements
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
in
which
local
officers
are
trained
to
identify
arrest
detain
and
begin
the
removal
process
for
undocumented
immigrants
whom
they
encounter
in
the
course
of
their
regular
law
enforcement
activities
the
mecklenburg
county
sheriffs
department
was
the
first
in
the
state
to
enter
the
program
ice
programs
in
gaston
and
alamance
counties
have
since
followed
theyre
basically
ice
agents
gordon
said
and
they
have
access
to
ice
databases
where
they
can
check
for
immigration
violations
the
program
appears
to
be
meeting
its
goals
within
10
months
after
ice
began
in
mecklenburg
county
the
sheriffs
department
booked
3000
immigrant
residents
and
started
deportation
proceedings
against
1530
according
to
media
reports
it
also
has
put
a
strain
on
charlottearea
immigration
law
attorneys
more
people
are
being
arrested
said
cynthia
a
aziz
who
has
practiced
immigration
law
for
18
years
in
charlotte
so
our
volume
of
cases
has
stepped
up
dramatically
hans
christian
linnartz
a
durham
attorney
who
teaches
legal
writing
and
immigration
law
at
dukes
law
school
said
the
ice
programs
could
lead
to
targeting
of
immigrants
especially
hispanics
most
officers
wont
abuse
this
power
but
some
will
routinely
detaining
anyone
who
doesnt
speak
english
and
cant
produce
a
green
card
proof
of
us
citizenship
or
evidence
of
valid
nonimmigrant
status
linnartz
said
the
complexities
of
immigration
law
will
insure
that
many
who
are
perfectly
legal
will
be
detained
until
they
can
prove
so
to
local
law
enforcement
or
to
ice
the
spanishspeaking
community
will
suffer
many
extra
detentions
both
of
actually
illegal
aliens
and
also
us
citizens
and
other
people
in
lawful
status
there
is
an
added
concern
linnartz
said
that
the
programs
will
make
the
immigrant
community
nervous
about
reporting
crimes
to
local
law
enforcement
inevitably
criminals
will
soon
target
this
group
of
residents
as
easy
victims
linnartz
said
pointing
to
robberies
and
bogus
documentation
scams
on
the
black
market
unreported
crimes
against
them
will
skyrocket
branching
out
the
role
of
the
attorney
is
more
important
than
ever
in
making
sure
clients
understand
their
rights
when
immigration
issues
arise
aziz
said
for
instance
since
immigration
violations
are
civil
and
not
criminal
there
is
no
right
to
appointed
counsel
or
miranda
warnings
no
exclusionary
rule
against
the
use
of
illegal
evidence
in
immigration
proceedings
no
right
to
immediate
release
on
bond
and
in
many
cases
no
right
to
appear
before
an
immigration
court
before
removal
from
the
country
according
to
linnartz
by
policy
ice
often
accords
suspected
illegal
immigrants
more
rights
than
the
law
requires
and
we
can
be
thankful
for
those
small
mercies
he
said
but
someone
attempting
to
defend
against
deportation
is
in
a
far
worse
position
than
a
person
attempting
to
defend
criminal
charges
this
means
criminal
defense
attorneys
must
be
aware
that
accepting
a
guilty
plea
in
a
criminal
matter
could
in
some
cases
start
their
clients
deportation
its
critical
that
lawyers
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
immigration
laws
and
not
just
dabble
in
it
aziz
said
deportation
in
some
cases
can
lead
to
a
mandatory
10year
bar
on
entering
the
country
which
can
have
tragic
impacts
on
families
and
raise
custody
issues
gordon
said
he
said
that
he
frequently
is
approached
by
employers
after
they
have
learned
that
a
key
worker
or
supervisor
is
out
of
status
these
people
are
important
for
their
business
good
people
hard
workers
with
children
or
spouses
who
are
us
citizens
gordon
said
but
we
have
to
explain
to
them
that
the
law
is
that
they
are
barred
from
being
here
if
they
are
not
legal

winstonsalem
attorney
sean
lew
who
will
become
the
nc
bar
associations
immigration
law
committee
chair
in
july
said
he
has
noticed
an
increased
interest
in
this
area
of
law
among
members
of
the
bar
we
have
many
nonimmigration
lawyers
who
come
into
our
meetings
he
said
theres
a
lot
of
overlap
gordon
said
that
north
carolinas
approach
to
immigration
law
has
made
it
one
of
the
countrys
leaders
including
its
requirement
that
lawyers
seeking
to
become
certified
specialists
in
the
field
must
pass
a
test
gordon
who
helped
design
the
test
played
a
part
in
establishing
the
north
carolinasouth
carolina
chapter
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
it
all
goes
to
improving
the
expertise
of
lawyers
who
are
practicing
in
a
very
complex
area
he
said
in
chairing
the
comprehensive
80page
mayors
immigration
commission
study
gordon
wanted
to
provide
attorneys
with
knowledge
about
more
than
substantive
law
and
procedure
he
wanted
them
to
get
the
bigger
picture
by
seeing
how
the
states
immigrant
population
affects
education
health
care
and
other
areas
with
such
information
he
said
attorneys
should
be
able
to
understand
the
need
for
reform
of
the
nations
patchwork
system
of
immigration
laws
reform
that
has
become
the
focus
of
an
intense
national
debate
i
think
the
north
carolina
legal
community
is
very
concerned
and
compassionate
and
theyre
very
committed
to
righting
the
wrongs
and
fixing
the
systems
that
are
broken
gordon
said
i
hear
it
every
day
from
attorneys
who
are
practicing
in
other
areas
of
the
law
and
they
know
its
time
to
talk
to
senators
and
congressmen
and
get
immigration
reform
thats
equitable
and
fair
and
reflects
the
american
values
of
hard
work
and
honor

later

to
make

swifter
and
life
easier
for

and
their
clients
the

office
for
immigration
review
eoir
announced
plans
to
establish
the
court
in
march
charlotte
was
among
three
cities
selected
for
courts
because
of
growing
immigration
caseloads
joining
omaha
neb
and
kansas
city
mo
there
are
54
immigration
courts
nationwide
including
atlanta
where
north
carolina
cases
are
handled
what
really
drove
it
was
the
volume
of
cases
said
cynthia
a
aziz
a
charlotte
attorney
who
has
practiced
in
the
atlanta
court
since
1989
it
has
increased
dramatically
through
the
years
among
states
without
an
immigration
court
north
carolina
has
ranked
among
the
top
three
in
the
country
since
2003
in
the
number
of
cases
involving
its
residents
in
fact
the
majority
of
cases
in
the
atlanta
court
have
come
from
north
carolina
we
have
criteria
that
we
use
and
the
numbers
increase
in
the
charlotte
area
had
made
it
one
of
the
top
one
or
two
potential
sites
for
the
last
three
years
said
susan
eastwood
a
public
affairs
specialist
for
eoir
it
should
be
a
significant
benefit
to
the
area
eastwood
said
that
a
building
had
not
yet
been
chosen
for
the
court
which
will
have
one
judge
and
a
support
staff
it
will
operate
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
handle
common
immigration
cases
including
removal
and
asylum
hearings
alan
gordon
a
charlotte
attorney
who
chaired
the
mayors
immigration
commission
study
that
recommended
an
immigration
court
for
charlotte
said
that
the
atlanta
court
had
become
overburdened
and
understaffed
in
recent
years
he
said
the
charlotte
court
should
make
the
system
more
efficient
and
cut
down
on
expensive
travel
for
his
clients
many
of
whom
come
from
lowincome
situations
and
theyll
be
closer
to
friends
and
family
while
going
through
the
process
