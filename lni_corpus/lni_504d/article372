the
house
yesterday
approved
a
major
immigration
bill
after
stripping
it
of
provisions
aimed
at
reducing
the
influx
of
legal
immigrants
the
final
vote
of
333
to
87
came
after
the
clinton
administration
threw
its
support
behind
a
move
to
limit
the
legislation
essentially
to
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
the
bill
beefs
up
the
border
patrol
streamlines
deportation
procedures
toughens
penalties
for
alien
smuggling
and
document
fraud
and
makes
it
more
difficult
for
illegal
aliens
to
receive
education
and
welfare
benefits
earlier
a
vote
on
a
key
amendment
which
passed
238
to
183
deleted
sections
that
would
have
reduced
levels
of
legal
immigration
from
about
775000
a
year
at
present
to
about
700000
annually
for
the
first
five
years
and
fewer
than
600000
a
year
after
that
the
bill
originally
conceived
as
the
most
ambitious
effort
to
overhaul
us
immigration
laws
in
30
years
addressed
an
issue
that
has
sparked
hot
political
rhetoric
on
the
campaign
trail
in
this
election
season
and
that
promises
to
figure
in
both
parties
attempts
to
woo
electoral
voterich
california
deleting
the
provisions
on
legal
immigration
removed
the
most
contentious
parts
of
the
bill
and
brought
it
more
closely
into
line
with
a
senate
version
now
before
its
judiciary
committee
by
shifting
their
focus
to
a
crackdown
on
illegal
aliens
the
representatives
seized
an
issue
on
which
there
is
broad
agreement
but
did
little
to
lower
the
overall
influx
of
immigrants
most
of
whom
come
to
the
united
states
legally
voting
on
other
amendments
the
house
rejected
efforts
by
powerful
agricultural
interests
to
insert
a
new
guestworker
program
into
the
bill
one
defeated
amendment
would
have
allowed
admission
of
up
to
250000
agricultural
guest
workers
a
year
and
another
would
have
let
in
up
to
100000
a
year
the
clinton
administrations
support
for
the
amendment
to
strip
the
bill
surprised
its
chief
sponsors
texans
lamar
s
smith
r
and
john
bryant
d
clinton
had
previously
expressed
support
for
the
recommendations
of
the
bipartisan
commission
on
immigration
reform
which
had
called
for
significant
cuts
in
legal
immigration
and
upon
which
portions
of
the
house
bill
were
based
we
were
able
to
keep
our
promise
and
produce
a
bipartisan
bill
that
is
truly
in
the
national
interest
smith
said
he
said
that
losing
the
legal
reform
provisions
was
clearly
a
disappointment
but
that
the
issue
is
unlikely
to
die
i
dont
think
the
administration
appreciates
the
strong
feelings
of
americans
on
immigration
reform
he
said
the
vote
was
immediately
hailed
by
members
of
an
eclectic
proimmigration
coalition
that
united
business
labor
ethnic
religious
liberal
conservative
and
libertarian
groups
it
was
bitterly
denounced
by
advocates
of
lower
immigration
levels
who
charged
that
the
bill
had
been
gutted
by
special
interests
supporters
of
the
amendment
sponsored
by
an
unlikely
alliance
of
two
conservative
republican
freshmen
and
a
veteran
liberal
democrat
portrayed
the
bills
effort
to
reduce
legal
immigration
as
unfair
rep
dick
chrysler
rmich
one
of
the
sponsors
said
the
bill
was
closing
the
door
on
families
of
us
citizens
he
added
i
cannot
justify
voting
for
the
drastic
cuts
in
legal
immigration
because
of
problems
in
illegal
immigration
it
is
fundamentally
wrong
to
take
the
justifiable
anger
about
our
failure
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
and
piggyback
on
top
of
that
anger
a
drastic
cut
in
permanent
legal
immigration
a
cause
and
a
force
that
has
been
good
for
this
country
said
rep
howard
l
berman
dcalif
another
sponsor
we
are
a
nation
of
immigrants
said
rep
sam
brownback
rkan
the
third
cosponsor
congress
should
preserve
that
proud
tradition
not
threaten
it
opponents
argued
that
the
two
issues
of
legal
and
illegal
immigration
could
not
be
separated
a
fundamental
problem
in
our
current
immigration
system
is
that
more
than
80
percent
of
all
legal
immigrants
are
now
admitted
without
reference
to
their
skills
and
education
and
37
percent
lack
even
a
high
school
education
smith
said
this
surplus
of
unskilled
immigrants
hurts
those
americans
who
can
least
afford
it
those
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
economic
ladder
youve
got
to
deal
with
legal
immigration
thats
where
the
numbers
are
said
bryant
illegal
immigration
is
estimated
to
add
300000
to
400000
people
to
the
us
population
each
year
while
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
and
refugees
has
exceeded
1
million
in
some
recent
years
bryant
on
wednesday
expressed
great
disappointment
and
contempt
for
the
white
houses
surprise
decision
to
support
stripping
the
legal
immigration
provisions
from
the
bill
calling
it
a
politically
cowardly
reversal
of
a
yearold
position
it
is
a
simple
case
of
caving
in
to
political
pressure
he
said
administration
officials
said
they
still
support
modest
reform
of
legal
immigration
and
hope
to
include
measures
to
protect
us
workers
in
any
new
bill

that
issue
