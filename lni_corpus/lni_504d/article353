the
federal
appeals
court
ruling
yesterday
in
the
elian
gonzalez
case
reaffirmed
legal
principles
that
give
federal
agencies
and
particularly
immigration
officials
wide
authority
the
decision
by
a
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
11th
circuit
was
a
clear
but
somewhat
lukewarm
endorsement
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
services
position
that
only
elians
father
not
the
6yearold
boy
himself
or
his
miami
relatives
could
decide
whether
the
boy
would
seek
asylum
although
the
courts
should
not
be
unquestioning
we
should
respect
the
other
branches
policymaking
powers
the
decision
said
the
judicial
power
is
a
limited
power
to
experts
on
family
law
the
ruling
was
an
endorsement
of
legal
rules
that
generally
declare
that
unless
they
are
abusive
parents
speak
for
their
children
in
deciding
where
and
with
whom
the
children
live
but
some
immigration
lawyers
said
they
were
troubled
that
the
courts
decision
gave
the
immigration
service
such
wide
latitude
our
concern
is
this
is
setting
a
dangerous
precedent
for
other
children
who
might
need
to
seek
asylum
in
this
country
said
wendy
young
a
lawyer
and
the
director
for
government
relations
of
the
womens
commission
for
refugee
women
and
children
the
group
works
to
increase
refugees
asylum
and
immigration
rights
internationally
the
court
ms
young
said
is
placing
in
the
hands
of
the
ins
the
total
discretion
of
deciding
which
of
those
claims
it
will
hear
and
which
of
those
claims
it
wont
hear
based
on
the
childs
age
the
judges
suggested
that
if
it
had
been
up
to
them
they
might
have
made
a
different
decision
and
considered
whether
elian
needed
asylum
from
the
marxist
cuban
government
but
they
said
they
were
not
permitted
to
secondguess
a
decision
by
immigration
officials
that
fit
within
the
range
of
reasonable
choices
even
if
that
decision
worries
us
some
the
three
judges
who
ruled
yesterday
j
l
edmondson
joel
f
dubina
and
charles
r
wilson
were
the
same
judges
who
ruled
in
april
that
elian
had
to
remain
in
this
country
while
his
case
was
decided
although
the
decision
did
little
to
change
existing
law
some
immigration
lawyers
said
the
judges
handsoff
position
in
such
a
highprofile
case
was
likely
to
be
taken
by
immigration
officials
as
a
signal
that
the
courts
would
seldom
intervene
the
ruling
is
worrying
as
a
precedent
in
the
sense
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
minors
mostly
unaccompanied
need
to
claim
protection
from
persecution
said
arthur
c
helton
an
immigration
law
expert
and
a
senior
fellow
at
the
council
on
foreign
relations
the
womens
commission
for
refugee
women
and
children
said
4600
unaccompanied
children
were
detained
for
possible
deportation
by
immigration
officials
last
year
an
applicant
is
eligible
for
asylum
under
the
law
if
he
or
she
has
a
wellfounded
fear
of
persecution
based
on
political
beliefs
or
membership
in
racial
religious
national
or
social
groups
in
its
opinion
yesterday
the
court
itself
noted
that
the
decision
could
hurt
some
children
we
recognize
that
in
some
instances
the
ins
policy
of
deferring
to
parents
especially
those
residing
outside
of
this
country
might
hinder
some
6yearolds
with
nonfrivolous
asylum
claims
the
opinion
said
but
the
judges
concluded
we
cannot
disturb
the
ins
policy
in
this
case
just
because
it
might
be
imperfect
elians
claim
for
asylum
began
with
an
application
filed
by
his
greatuncle
and
later
an
application
filed
in
the
boys
own
name
his
father
subsequently
told
the
immigration
officials
that
he
did
not
want
an
application
for
asylum
to
be
considered
the
boys
miami
relatives
argued
that
it
was
by
definition
abusive
for
his
father
to
insist
on
returning
elian
to
cuba
courts
generally
defer
to
the
expertise
of
administrative
agencies
but
in
the
area
of
immigration
law
courts
have
held
that
the
authority
of
judges
is
even
more
limited
because
immigration
policy
is
part
of
foreign
relations
where
the
executive
branch
is
given
wide
authority
some
experts
on
immigration
law
said
yesterday
that
they
did
not
share
the
concerns
of
some
immigration
lawyers
that
the
decision
yesterday
could
harm
other
children
david
a
martin
a
former
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
said
it
was
standard
practice
for
the
courts
to
recognize
that
immigration
officials
not
judges
are
experts
in
making
decisions
about
such
issues
mr
martin
who
is
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
virginia
said
the
opinion
yesterday
was
of
limited
reach
because
the
immigration
service
conceded
that
some
children
could
seek
asylum
even
if
their
parents
objected
like
when
they
were
threatened
with
imminent
harm
in
this
case
he
said
it
became
a
question
of
line
drawing
when
do
you
consider
the
wishes
of
the
parent
and
when
do
you
consider
the
childs
case
independently
other
immigration
law
experts
said
that
given
the
facts
of
elians
case
it
would
have
been
extraordinary
for
a
court
to
require
immigration
officials
to
consider
an
application
filed
against
his
fathers
wishes
there
are
cases
in
which
courts
have
gone
too
far
in
refusing
to
review
the
decision
of
immigration
officials
said
stephen
h
legomsky
a
professor
of
immigration
law
at
the
washington
university
school
of
law
in
st
louis
but
mr
legomsky
said
any
court
would
come
out
this
way
in
terms
of
the
father
having
the
right
to
decide
for
this
6year
old
child
