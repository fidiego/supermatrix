georgia
joins
mounting
red
state
backlash
to
obama
immigration
reform
in
the
same
week
that
president
obama
tried
to
lay
out
a
middle
path
to
immigration
reform
georgia
gov
nathan

signed
a
bill
that
takes
a
tough

three
days
after
president
obama
mocked
republicans
as
being
unreasonable
in
the
national

at
least
one
republican
governor
doubled
down
friday
signing
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
in
protest
against
what
he
deems
failed
federal
policies
the
georgia
immigration
law
signed
by
gov
nathan
deal
is
a
redstate
rejoinder
to
mr
obamas
insistence
that
some
path
to
citizenship
should
be
a
part
of
any
federal
immigration
reform
it
gives
state
police
more
power
to
pinpoint
people
who
are
in
the
state
illegally
and
forces
larger
agribusinesses
to
run
employees
names
through
a
federal
database
to
verify
their
eligibility
to
work
legally
inside
the
united
states
that
such
a
bill
passed
in
georgia
alienating
the
states
powerful
agribusiness
lobby
tourism
officials
and
a
nascent
latino
population
is
a
testament
to
the
symbolic
power
that
governor
deal
and
other
republican
legislators
have
invested
in
the
issue
indeed
with
courts
likely
to
strike
down
the
more
controversial
parts
of
the
law
as
they
have
in
arizona
and
utah
the
symbolism
of
tilting
at
an
allegedly
out
of
touch
washington
is
perhaps
the
primary
reason
for
passing
the
bill
this
symbolism
in
the
immigration
debate
is
exerting
an
increasingly
powerful
sway
over
the
republican
party
with
similar
bills
churning
in
alabama
and
florida
and
with
a
presidential
election
looming
deal
and
his
gubernatorial
colleagues
could
yet
see
their
lawandorder
approach
to
immigration
reform
become
a
litmus
test
for
republican
candidates
the
divide
in
terms
of
the
direction
of
immigration
reform
is
in
part
a
reflection
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
stalemate
in
congress
says
alan
abramowitz
a
political
scientist
at
emory
university
in
atlanta
so
now
we
have
moreconservative
states
in
the
south
and
west
moving
toward
tough
anti
immigration
statutes
and
as
a
result
the
republican
party
has
moved
increasingly
toward
this
sort
of
hardline
approach
politics
or
upholding
the
rule
of
law
obama
tried
to
exploit
that
for
his
political
gain
in
el
paso
texas
tuesday
as
he
reached
out
for
the
latino
vote
to
be
sure
the
president
has
a
mixed
record
on
illegal
immigration
having
deported
more
illegal
immigrants
in
a
single
year
than
any
other
president
obama
has
also
completed
a
federal
border
fence
and
doubled
the
number
of
border
patrol
agents
along
the
border
but
he
suggested
mockingly
on
tuesday
that
even
this
was
not
enough
for
republicans
who
are
ultimately
not
interested
in
tackling
illegal
immigration
in
a
serious
way
he
said
theyll
say
we
need
to
triple
the
border
patrol
or
quadruple
the
border
patrol
the
president
said
theyll
say
we
need
a
higher
fence
to
support
reform
maybe
theyll
say
we
need
a
moat
or
alligators
in
the
moat
theyll
never
be
satisfied
and
i
understand
that
thats
politics
deal
has
a
different
take
on
the
republican
line
today
we
are
taking
action
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
deal
said
of
the
georgia
bill
friday
the
bill
is
an
undeniably
strong
political
statement
it
was
passed
not
only
despite
legal
concerns
that
it
impinges
on
federal
primacy
of
immigration
policy
but
also
despite
strong
opposition
among
key
constituencies
in
his
own
state
while
the
latino
vote
is
still
weak
making
up
3
percent
of
the
voting
public
the
states
agricultural
interests
hold
significant
sway
impact
of
the
georgia
bill
that
georgia
republicans
were
insistent
on
passing
the
law
despite
these
hurdles
suggests
that
republican
presidential
candidates
might
have
to
toe
the
same
policy
line
in
the
south
and
west
or
risk
alienating
conservative
voters
in
those
areas
for
one
indiana
gov
mitch
daniels
r
whose
name
is
mentioned
as
a
possible
republican
candidate
would
have
to
explain
why
he
demanded
the
legislature
drop
a
lawenforcement
component
from
two
immigration
reform
bills
he
signed
tuesday
the
indiana
bills
in
essence
compel
most
businesses
to
verify
the
residency
status
of
workers
and
make
undocumented
immigrants
ineligible
to
receive
college
tuition
and
state
welfare
benefits
the
greatest
impact
of
the
georgia
bill
might
be
on
the
national
debate
not
on
illegal
immigration
in
georgia
the
bills
sponsors
though
they
tweaked
language
that
federal
appeals
courts
have
now
twice
struck
down
in
the
arizona
bill
dont
seem
overly
concerned
about
the
laws
constitutionality
which
the
state
will
likely
have
to
defend
in
court
part
of
the
calculation
suggests
professor
abramowitz
is
that
theyre
expecting
parts
of
it
to
get
thrown
out
the
georgia
law
could
however
pave
the
way
for
other
states
to
challenge
washingtons
immigration
policy
and
by
extension
obamas
border
stance
in
that
way
the
georgia
immigration
law
offers
a
gauge
of
the
political
landscape
heading
into
the
2012
election
with
deal
for
one
willing
to
invite
the
wrath
of
farmers
and
potential
tourist
and
convention
boycotts
in
order
to
raise
the
stakes
of
the
immigration
debate
