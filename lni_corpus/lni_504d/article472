i
have
a
document
that
should
appall
anyone
who
still
believes
vigorous
debate
is
the
cornerstone
of
a
healthy
democracy
entitled
canadians
attitudes
toward
immigration
it
was
commissioned
for
citizenship
and
immigration
canada
cic
and
received
by
the
government
this
past
june
it
is
a
remarkable
summary
of
how
the
policy
that
will
shape
canadas
future
more
profoundly
than
any
other
and
the
chatter
of
those
who
produce
it
bear
little
resemblance
to
the
views
desires
and
fears
of
the
canadian
public
you
are
not
likely
however
to
get
a
copy
with
a
friendly
phone
call
to
the
minister
of
immigration
i
made
that
call
and
was
turned
down
cold
it
took
freedom
of
information
legislation
and
a
twomonth
wait
to
see
what
the
ministers
office
did
not
want
seen
almost
every
page
exposes
the
gulf
between
immigration
policymakers
and
the
opinionmaking
class
on
one
side
and
canadian
popular
opinion
on
the
other
supporters
and
opponents
of
current
immigration
levels
are
about
evenly
split
and
many
of
those
who
support
the
levels
do
so
only
halfheartedly
support
is
highest
in
regions
where
almost
no
immigrants
settle
and
lowest
where
the
vast
majority
of
immigrants
do
canadians
predominantly
think
immigration
contributes
to
unemployment
the
facts
roll
on
but
the
most
striking
aspects
of
the
study
are
those
it
only
inadvertently
highlights
first
its
clear
that
official
immigration
policies
and
polite
public
discussion
are
utterly
detached
from
the
views
of
large
sections
of
the
canadian
public
more
ominously
for
the
future
cohesion
of
what
is
already
one
of
the
worlds
most
fragmented
societies
current
mass
immigration
seems
to
be
entrenching
new
mutually
suspicious
solitudes
canada
does
not
debate
immigration
aside
from
very
occasional
newspaper
columns
the
odd
caller
to
phonein
shows
or
little
flurries
over
relatively
minor
issues
like
sponsorship
or
czech
gypsies
the
media
devote
more
time
and
effort
to
commercial
fishing
or
gambling
in
the
political
arena
no
canadian
party
has
seriously
questioned
basic
immigration
policies
since
the
1960s
and
immigration
has
not
played
a
major
part
in
any
modern
election
this
silence
is
particularly
odd
given
that
in
each
of
the
other
three
countries
that
permit
mass
immigration
australia
the
united
states
and
new
zealand
there
are
vigorous
debates
about
the
level
of
immigration
or
even
whether
mass
immigration
should
be
abolished
stranger
still
canadas
per
capita
rate
of
immigration
is
far
higher
than
any
of
these
three
we
accepted
about
220000
immigrants
in
1996
or
about
one
immigrant
for
every
136
current
residents
in
the
us
the
figure
is
one
immigrant
to
every
388
residents
in
new
zealand
it
is
one
for
every
233
resident
and
one
to
253
in
australia
one
in
eight
canadians
is
an
immigrant
compared
to
one
in
16
in
the
united
states
about
onehalf
of
canadas
current
population
growth
is
the
result
of
immigration
a
figure
that
will
steadily
rise
as
our
birth
rate
drops
over
the
coming
decades
so
that
by
2030
immigration
may
be
the
sole
source
of
population
growth
immigration
affects
literally
every
segment
of
canadian
life
and
if
policies
dont
change
it
will
do
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
in
future
it
is
a
critical
policy
and
according
to
the
cic
report
canadians
are
deeply
divided
about
it
so
where
is
the
debate
it
has
been
smothered
beneath
a
blanket
of
orthodoxy
that
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
opinions
of
canadians
the
liberal
government
continues
to
promise
to
increase
immigration
to
one
per
cent
of
total
population
or
in
other
words
to
increase
current
yearly
levels
by
80000
to
300000
per
year
the
one
per
cent
figure
was
chosen
incidentally
not
because
it
has
any
policy
significance
but
because
its
a
nice
simple
figure
that
sounds
vaguely
significant
the
liberals
are
being
urged
to
follow
through
by
the
ndp
and
numerous
immigrant
lobby
groups
adding
to
the
push
in
print
are
several
major
newspapers
and
many
columnists
including
andrew
cardozo
of
the
pearsonshoyama
institute
not
to
be
outdone
canadas
right
is
even
more
bullish
on
immigration
than
the
left
the
fraser
institute
chided
the
liberals
for
failing
to
meet
their
promise
in
their
first
mandate
globe
and
mail
columnist
terence
corcoran
argues
that
anyone
in
the
world
who
wants
to
come
to
canada
should
be
allowed
in
southam
national
affairs
columnist
andrew
coyne
agrees
but
theres
a
wrinkle
in
the
midst
of
this
smooth
surface
of
agreement
the
cic
report
states
unequivocally
there
is
virtually
no
public
support
for
any
increase
in
immigration
levels
no
matter
the
public
is
apparently
irrelevant
it
is
often
claimed
however
that
popular
opposition
to
mass
immigration
now
has
a
democratic
voice
in
the
reform
party
but
reforms
immigration
policy
so
often
mischaracterized
as
antiimmigration
calls
only
for
a
modest
reduction
in
total
numbers
to
1987
levels
and
a
resumption
of
the
policy
of
reducing
immigration
during
recessions
standard
postwar
policy
until
brian
mulroney
changed
it
in
1990
and
reform
has
generally
been
precluded
from
arguing
even
this
tepid
case
for
fear
of
raising
the
dreaded
racism
label
so
the
official
opinionchurning
world
has
one
almost
uniform
message
immigration
is
an
undiluted
good
we
can
argue
about
nuances
like
business
investment
programs
but
the
basic
policy
of
mass
immigration
on
a
scale
unique
in
the
world
is
not
open
for
debate
this
message
hasnt
been
missed
by
the
public
the
cic
study
found
substantial
evidence
that
survey
respondents
were
reluctant
to
express
opposition
to
current
immigration
levels
if
they
thought
it
would
make
them
look
racist
this
occurred
if
they
were
asked
about
matters
such
as
racism
ethnic
diversity
and
multiculturalism
before
the
immigration
questions
or
if
the
interviewer
had
a
foreign
accent
these
are
private
surveys
conducted
by
anonymous
telephone
interviewers
and
yet
many
of
the
almost
onehalf
of
canadians
with
concerns
about
immigration
felt
compelled
to
censor
themselves
this
is
an
indictment
of
the
antidemocratic
stifling
dogma
surrounding
immigration
the
cic
study
also
seems
to
deflate
the
myth
that
opposition
to
mass
immigration
neatly
rises
and
falls
according
to
the
fortunes
of
the
economy
in
199o
the
mulroney
government
dropped
the
longstanding
policy
that
immigration
numbers
would
be
reduced
during
recessions
instead
the
government
raised
the
numbers
to
levels
not
seen
over
an
extended
period
since
before
the
first
world
war
support
for
the
policy
dropped
as
canada
suffered
the
worst
recession
since
the
depression
but
commentators
simply
assumed
that
with
the
return
of
better
economic
times
public
support
would
rapidly
rise
the
cic
study
did
find
slow
growth
in
support
to
the
current
unimpressive
level
but
it
also
detected
evidence
that
this
growth
has
actually
peaked
despite
the
rapid
job
creation
of
the
past
six
months
and
rocketing
consumer
confidence
the
old
pat
belief
that
opposition
to
immigration
is
purely
a
product
of
lean
economic
times
is
beginning
to
look
threadbare
another
serious
gap
between
popular
opinion
and
government
policy
was
exposed
in
the
publics
response
to
the
question
of
whether
new
citizens
ought
to
be
able
to
speak
french
or
english
overwhelmingly
canadians
agreed
immigrantcanadians
were
particularly
strong
on
this
point
yet
government
policy
of
the
past
several
decades
has
allowed
the
number
of
immigrants
who
come
to
canada
unable
to
speak
english
or
french
to
rise
from
five
per
cent
in
the
early
1970s
to
41
per
cent
in
the
early
1990s
on
the
central
question
of
economics
the
public
is
again
at
odds
with
the
chattering
classes
when
asked
what
effect
immigration
has
on
unemployment
more
than
twice
as
many
said
it
increased
unemployment
than
said
it
had
a
positive
effect
this
view
is
predominant
in
the
words
of
the
report
unfortunately
this
question
is
phrased
inappropriately
since
employment
is
only
one
factor
in
the
economic
picture
there
are
many
economic
concerns
one
could
have
with
mass
immigration
other
than
its
effects
on
employment
a
substantial
part
of
the
american
labour
movement
for
example
opposes
immigration
on
the
grounds
that
it
pushes
lowend
wages
down
but
because
this
question
is
flawed
we
dont
really
know
the
full
significance
of
the
public
response
to
it
some
of
the
respondents
may
be
expressing
the
old
canard
immigrants
take
jobs
to
that
extent
the
public
response
is
unfortunate
because
its
wrong
the
research
is
clear
that
over
the
longerterm
immigration
does
not
cost
canadian
jobs
but
theres
a
new
myth
being
floated
by
the
political
and
opinionmaking
elite
immigrants
create
jobs
part
of
the
public
response
may
well
be
a
rejection
of
this
falsehood
to
that
extent
the
public
has
it
right
a
1991
study
by
the
economic
council
of
canada
found
immigrations
economic
effect
to
be
marginal
and
that
very
rapid
increases
in
immigration
can
temporarily
boost
unemployment
studies
by
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
and
the
economic
council
of
australia
have
replicated
that
finding
and
it
is
rapidly
being
accepted
among
economists
the
report
contains
numerous
ambiguities
like
the
employment
question
not
due
to
any
mistakes
by
its
author
but
because
the
original
public
opinion
polls
use
terribly
vague
questions
that
cry
out
for
more
information
of
course
polls
are
the
political
elites
way
of
finding
the
publics
pulse
in
a
healthy
democracy
that
pulse
would
be
evident
in
an
open
vigorous
debate
as
a
democracy
canadas
political
system
not
only
assumes
such
a
debate
is
ongoing
it
needs
it
to
make
the
best
decisions
public
debate
is
a
crucible
that
tests
ideas
exposes
falsehoods
and
makes
strong
ideas
stronger
yet
the
critical
policy
of
mass
immigration
has
escaped
that
crucible
it
may
be
good
policy
as
half
of
canadians
think
or
it
may
be
seriously
flawed
as
the
other
half
feel
but
there
is
one
certainty
canadas
failure
to
debate
immigration
is
a
failure
of
democracy
itself
in
future
ill
look
at
some
of
the
more
unsettling
revelations
of
the
cic
study
including
the
remarkable
regional
variations
that
mark
canadians
views
of
the
effects
of
immigration
and
further
define
