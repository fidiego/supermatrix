washington
congressional
budget
analysts
providing
a
positive
economic
assessment
of
proposed
immigration
law
changes
said
tuesday
that
legislation
to
overhaul
the
nations
immigration
system
would
cut
close
to
1
trillion
from
the
federal
deficit
over
the
next
two
decades
and
lead
to
more
than
10
million
new
legal
residents
in
the
country
a
longawaited
analysis
by
the
congressional
budget
office
found
that
the
benefits
of
an
increase
in
legal
residents
from
immigration
legislation
currently
being
debated
in
the
senate
which
includes
a
pathway
to
citizenship
would
outweigh
the
costs
while
the
report
was
a
clear
victory
for
immigration
proponents
it
came
just
hours
after
speaker
john
a
boehner
raised
potential
new
obstacles
for
the
bill
saying
he
would
not
bring
any
immigration
measure
to
the
floor
unless
it
had
the
support
of
a
majority
of
house
republicans
the
report
estimates
that
in
the
first
decade
after
the
immigration
bill
is
carried
out
the
net
effect
of
adding
millions
of
additional
taxpayers
would
decrease
the
federal
budget
deficit
by
197
billion
over
the
next
decade
the
report
found
the
deficit
reduction
would
be
even
greater
an
estimated
700
billion
from
2024
to
2033
the
deficit
reduction
figures
for
the
first
decade
do
not
take
into
account
22
billion
in
the
discretionary
spending
required
to
implement
the
bill
however
making
the
savings
slightly
lower
the
report
was
immediately
seized
on
by
backers
of
the
bill
as
a
significant
boost
to
its
prospects
senator
charles
e
schumer
democrat
of
new
york
one
of
the
bills
authors
said
the
report
debunks
the
idea
that
immigration
reform
is
anything
other
than
a
boon
to
our
economy
the
budget
office
also
found
that
in
the
next
decade
the
legislation
would
lead
to
a
net
increase
of
about
104
million
permanent
legal
residents
and
16
million
temporary
workers
and
their
dependents
as
well
as
a
decrease
of
about
16
million
unauthorized
residents
conservatives
had
expected
that
an
analysis
of
the
second
decade
when
immigrants
would
begin
to
qualify
for
federal
benefits
would
bolster
their
argument
that
the
costs
of
an
immigration
overhaul
were
unwieldy
but
that
turned
out
not
to
be
the
case
in
the
economic
analysis
senator
jeff
sessions
republican
of
alabama
a
leading
opponent
of
the
bill
said
that
its
authors
used
scoring
gimmicks
in
order
to
conceal
the
true
cost
from
taxpayers
as
a
result
the
score
effectively
conceals
some
of
the
biggest
longterm
costs
to
taxpayers
contained
in
this
legislation
including
providing
illegal
immigrants
with
medicaid
food
stamps
and
cash
welfare
mr
sessions
said
earlier
tuesday
mr
boehner
republican
of
ohio
tried
to
put
to
rest
discussion
that
he
would
consider
pushing
through
an
immigration
bill
with
a
combination
of
democrats
and
a
minority
of
receptive
republicans
in
the
house
where
conservative
republican
sentiment
runs
strongly
against
allowing
those
who
entered
the
country
illegally
to
qualify
for
legal
status
i
also
suggested
to
our
members
today
that
any
immigration
reform
bill
that
is
going
to
go
into
law
ought
to
have
a
majority
of
both
parties
support
if
were
really
serious
about
making
that
happen
and
so
i
dont
see
any
way
of
bringing
an
immigration
bill
to
the
floor
that
doesnt
have
a
majority
support
of
republicans
mr
boehner
said
at
a
news
conference
after
meeting
with
house
republicans
mr
boehners
comments
both
privately
in
the
meeting
at
the
capitol
hill
club
and
publicly
came
as
some
house
republicans
have
begun
to
draw
a
firm
and
vocal
line
in
the
sand
warning
mr
boehner
that
his
speakership
could
be
at
risk
if
he
tries
to
force
through
an
immigration
bill
without
his
conferences
support
in
an
interview
with
world
net
daily
radio
on
monday
representative
dana
rohrabacher
republican
of
california
said
mr
boehner
should
be
removed
as
speaker
if
on
immigration
he
violates
the
hastert
rule
an
unofficial
principle
named
for
j
dennis
hastert
a
former
republican
speaker
who
would
rarely
allow
a
vote
on
a
bill
that
did
not
have
the
support
of
a
majority
of
his
conference
though
mr
boehner
has
passed
measures
with
a
minority
of
republicans
several
times
this
year
to
help
avert
a
fiscal
showdown
provide
relief
for
victims
of
hurricane
sandy
and
pass
the
violence
against
women
act
he
explicitly
said
on
tuesday
that
he
would
not
take
up
an
immigration
bill
without
the
support
of
a
majority
of
his
party
mr
boehners
comments
will
make
it
harder
for
him
to
buck
conservatives
on
an
immigration
overhaul
something
that
many
party
leaders
consider
crucial
for
republicans
hoping
to
regain
their
national
standing
with
hispanic
voters
his
position
will
also
make
it
harder
to
strike
a
deal
between
the
house
and
the
senate
on
a
final
immigration
measure
if
the
legislative
process
gets
that
far
in
insisting
on
a
measure
that
most
of
his
members
can
support
mr
boehner
is
calling
for
legislation
that
is
likely
to
contain
border
security
requirements
and
limits
on
attaining
legal
status
that
many
democrats
and
other
proponents
of
new
legislation
will
resist
mr
boehner
is
well
aware
of
the
difficult
political
situation
he
finds
himself
in
when
asked
if
he
believed
he
could
lose
his
job
if
he
violated
the
hastert
rule
on
immigration
he
said
to
laughter
maybe
mr
boehner
would
not
initially
say
whether
he
would
also
require
majority
republican
support
on
any
legislation
to
emerge
from
negotiations
with
the
senate
over
a
final
bill
well
see
when
we
get
there
he
said
but
his
staff
later
clarified
that
he
would
not
violate
the
hastert
rule
on
anything
coming
out
of
conference
either
mr
boehners
comments
come
as
conservative
republicans
are
increasingly
worried
about
how
the
immigration
bill
will
be
handled
in
the
house
representative
steve
king
republican
of
iowa
a
leading
opponent
of
the
immigration
overhaul
making
its
way
through
the
senate
plans
to
hold
a
sixhour
news
conference
outside
the
capitol
on
wednesday
to
voice
his
concerns
about
the
current
bill
the
house
continued
a
piecemeal
approach
to
immigration
changes
with
the
republicanled
house
judiciary
committee
formally
drafting
a
measure
opposed
by
democrats
that
would
grant
states
and
localities
the
authority
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
