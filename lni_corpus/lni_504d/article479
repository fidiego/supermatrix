the
senate
judiciary
committee
today
approved
legislation
that
would
slightly
increase
the
number
of
foreignborn
relatives
who
can
be
brought
into
the
country
by
american
citizens
and
legal
residents
in
the
next
decade
most
of
the
relatives
would
be
wives
and
minor
children
the
committee
voting
13
to
4
also
adopted
provisions
favored
by
business
leaders
to
protect
american
workers
from
losing
their
jobs
to
temporary
skilled
foreigners
but
backers
of
organized
labor
including
the
clinton
administration
said
the
safeguards
were
insufficient
the
bill
could
put
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
skilled
us
workers
jobs
at
risk
labor
secretary
robert
b
reich
said
democrats
vowed
to
offer
amendments
to
protect
american
workers
when
the
full
senate
takes
up
the
bill
in
april
the
panels
action
came
on
the
day
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
announced
that
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
had
fallen
by
more
than
20
percent
during
the
last
two
years
according
to
the
immigration
service
720461
legal
immigrants
were
admitted
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
last
october
down
from
the
904292
in
the
1993
fiscal
year
the
20
percent
decline
is
the
largest
twoyear
drop
in
legal
immigration
since
the
1930s
and
is
part
of
an
overall
trend
in
immigration
during
the
last
four
years
supporters
of
legal
immigration
are
sure
to
use
these
statistics
as
fresh
evidence
that
efforts
to
curb
legal
immigration
mainly
to
appease
large
border
states
whose
social
services
are
being
taxed
by
new
immigrants
are
unnecessary
these
advocates
say
the
rush
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigrants
has
unfairly
included
attacks
on
an
american
tradition
of
legal
immigration
that
reunites
families
and
serves
as
a
wellspring
of
economic
innovation
the
house
last
week
overwhelmingly
approved
an
immigration
bill
that
would
impose
tough
new
restrictions
on
illegal
immigrants
but
dropped
most
provisions
dealing
with
legal
immigrants
the
senate
judiciary
committee
this
month
decided
to
address
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
separate
bills
the
panels
illegalimmigration
bill
resembles
the
house
provisions
since
the
house
has
few
remaining
provisions
governing
legal
immigrants
the
senate
bill
approved
today
will
become
the
main
legislative
vehicle
this
year
for
changes
in
legalimmigration
law
the
full
senate
is
to
consider
both
bills
during
the
week
of
april
15
a
coalition
of
liberal
democrats
and
conservative
republicans
supported
by
religious
organizations
and
proimmigration
groups
today
reversed
proposals
in
the
original
senate
bill
that
would
have
cut
legal
immigration
by
over
30
percent
after
five
years
family
immigration
makes
up
most
of
this
category
instead
the
panel
adopted
by
a
vote
of
11
to
4
a
different
familyvisa
approach
offered
by
senator
edward
m
kennedy
democrat
of
massachusetts
and
senator
spencer
abraham
republican
of
michigan
that
approach
allows
citizens
to
sponsor
their
spouses
minor
children
and
parents
it
is
expected
to
allow
about
250000
people
to
immigrate
a
year
the
original
senate
bill
written
by
senator
alan
k
simpson
republican
of
wyoming
would
have
limited
eligible
parents
to
those
people
65
or
older
who
had
a
majority
of
their
children
living
in
the
united
states
and
who
had
health
coverage
the
current
bill
would
also
allocate
175000
family
visas
a
year
for
citizens
and
legal
residents
to
bring
in
other
relatives
the
provision
would
reserve
at
least
75000
of
the
these
visas
for
children
of
citizens
the
remaining
100000
family
visas
would
then
go
to
in
priority
the
spouses
and
minor
children
of
legal
residents
the
children
of
citizens
the
children
of
legal
residents
and
the
siblings
of
citizens
finally
the
bill
provides
an
additional
75000
visas
a
year
for
10
years
to
help
reduce
the
backlog
of
11
million
spouses
and
minor
children
of
legal
residents
and
a
backlog
of
16
million
siblings
of
citizens
as
a
result
the
bill
approved
today
would
allow
for
500000
family
visas
a
year
for
10
years
compared
with
480000
allowed
now
a
4
percent
increase
the
original
senate
bill
would
have
eliminated
the
adult
children
and
siblings
categories
