like
a
bell
ringing
in
the
dead
of
night
extremism
is
reverberating
in
the
national
debate
over
immigration
to
make
things
worse
charges
of
immigration
extremism
are
being
voiced
by
immigration
extremists
from
virtually
all
segments
of
the
political
spectrum
in
a
debate
that
cries
for
informed
discussion
the
nation
is
instead
witnessing
an
old
marxist
strategy
of
demonizing
ones
enemies
by
exacerbating
the
contradictions
if
it
is
too
much
to
be
guided
by
the
national
interest
everyone
might
at

heed

timeless
advice
first
you
get
your
facts
straight
then
you
can
distort
them
all
you
want
in
the
search
for
extremism
one
need
look
no
further
than
current
us
legal
immigration
policy
itself
first
consider
that
this
country
takes
in
nearly
as
many
immigrants
and
refugees
for
permanent
resettlement
as
the
rest
of
the
world
combined
around
800000
legal
immigrants
are
entering
the
united
states
annually
along
with
an
estimated
300000
illegal
immigrants
this
adds
up
to
record
levels
of
well
more
than
1
million
newcomers
every
year
immigration
enthusiasts
often
speak
as
if
the
nations
history
has
featured
everspiraling
immigration
from
1607
and
the
founding
of
jamestown
va
onward
yet
this
is
false
instead
american
immigration
has
always
featured
an
ebbandflow
quality
in
the
20th
century
for
example
extremely
high
levels
of
immigration
leading
up
to
world
war
i
gave
way
to
a
period
of
extremely
low
immigration
especially
from
the
late
1920s
through
the
mid1960s
the
current
wave
of
immigration
that
has
been
occurring
for
over
25
years
is
largely
a
function
of
a
family
reunification
policy
implemented
in
1965
that
has
yielded
unintended
consequences
against
this
backdrop
conservative
author
peter
brimelow
is
now
raising
the
specter
of
internecine
strife
and
national
disintegration
because
of
nonwhite
immigration
in
particular
his
view
is
vigorously
seconded
by
presidential
aspirant
patrick
buchanan
now
expressing
concerns
over
immigration
is
not
necessarily
racist
or
xenophobic
yet
in
pitting
racial
groups
against
one
another
brimelow
and
buchanan
go
beyond
responsible
policy
prescriptions
obsessed
by
the
genuine
excesses
of
our
immigration
system
they
seek
to
cut
immigration
with
the
ax
of
an
immigration
moratorium
where
a
scalpel
is
more
appropriate
in
imbibing
their
doctrine
straight
their
vision
has
become
so
blurred
they
have
overlooked
the
great
power
of
assimilation
in
our
history
elsewhere
on
the
political
spectrum
liberals
such
as
new
york
times
columnist
a
m
rosenthal
have
not
only
supported
unusually
high
levels
of
legal
immigration
they
have
long
been
apologists
for
undocumented
immigration
as
well
finally
the
logical
extremity
of
libertarianism
was
encapsulated
in
a
1990
wall
street
journal
editorial
that
called
for
a
fiveword
constitutional
amendment
there
shall
be
open
borders
libertarian
extremism
is
present
in
congress
as
well
in
a
recent
speech
before
the
libertarian
cato
institute
house
majority
leader
dick
armey
sought
to
curry
favor
by
supporting
still
higher
levels
of
legal
immigration
while
expressing
his
opposition
to
those
measures
before
congress
that
promise
to
seriously
control
illegal
immigration
armey
is
the
immigration
policy
soul
mate
of
former
housing
secretary
jack
kemp
what
do
the
american
people
think
polls
have
consistently
found
that
the
public
at
large
favors
curbing
immigration
moreover
virtually
all
national
polls
of
minority
opinion
have
found
that
african
americans
and
hispanic
americans
also
believe
the
levels
of
immigration
are
too
high
perceived
drains
on
public
budgets
and
intensified
competition
for
jobs
social
services
and
lowcost
affordable
housing
are
some
of
the
reasons
offered
immigration
is
an
enormously
complex
issue
but
the
questions
that
should
guide
poli
cymakers
are
simple
enough
who
shall
come
how
many
shall
come
how
shall
the
law
be
enforced
reasonable
people
may
disagree
over
the
answers
to
those
questions
but
obviating
a
need
for
a
discussion
of
them
by
lobbying
for
doors
to
be
slammed
shut
or
floodgates
to
be
opened
can
only
be
seen
as
prima
facie
evidence
of
extremism
some
might
think
i
find
a
fixation
upon
race
in
the
debate
or
the
artificial
flooding
of
immigrants
into
lowwage
labor
markets
to
be
troubling
because
i
was
born
into
an
impoverished
american
family
of
mexican
descent
but
the
truth
is
i
find
it
troubling
because
i
am
an
american
