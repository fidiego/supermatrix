house
speaker
tom
craddick
today
finished
publishing
a
list
of
issues
he
wants
legislators
to
study
ahead
of
the
2009
legislative
session
among
several
border
security
and
immigration
issues
to
be
studied
is
a
federal
program
referred
to
as
287g
under
that
program
local
departments
sign
an
agreement
with
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
that
allows
officers
to
receive
training
and
become
authorized
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
charge
from
craddick
calls
on
the
house
state
affairs
committee
to
make
recommendations
to
encourage
local
governments
to
sign
the
agreements
during
the
legislative
session
this
year
lawmakers
hotly
debated
border
security
and
immigration
measures
though
few
were
passed
state
rep
david
swinford
chairman
of
the
state
affairs
committee
lead
many
of
the
immigration
discussions
this
year
the
republican
from
dumas
said
he
doesnt
plan
to
promote
287g
agreements
local
governments
he
said
should
decide
if
they
want
to
take
on
the
immigration
issue
but
he
said
he
wants
to
ensure
officers
get
the
appropriate
training
before
trying
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
some
local
police
and
city
leaders
he
said
have
been
enforcing
immigration
laws
without
the
training
or
authority
to
do
so
we
have
a
lot
of
cities
that
are
doing
really
stupid
stuff
out
there
swinford
said
carl
rusnok
ice
spokesman
said
local
officers
do
not
have
authority
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
unless
they
first
receive
training
currently
he
said
no
texas
agencies
have
signed
287g
agreements
with
ice
nationwide
34
local
agencies
have
fewer
than
600
officers
trained
to
enforce
immigration
laws
rusnok
said
el
paso
police
chief
richard
wiles
said
having
local
officers
enforce
immigration
laws
is
a
bad
idea
on
many
levels
it
would
break
the
trust
immigrants
both
legal
and
illegal
have
in
local
police
he
said
it
would
be
expensive
to
have
officers
get
the
training
it
would
raise
questions
about
racial
profiling
and
wiles
said
it
would
take
officers
away
from
their
primary
duty
of
protecting
the
community
from
crime
its
a
federal
responsibility
wiles
said
its
their
job
we
dont
have
the
resources
to
do
it
and
the
taxpayers
of
el
paso
should
not
have
to
pay
to
have
their
police
department
doing
the
federal
governments
job
