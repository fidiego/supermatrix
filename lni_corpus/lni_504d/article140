the
federal
government
has
failed
to
stem
our
nations
illegalimmigration
and
bordersecurity
problems
and
as
a
result
state
and
local
governments
have
been
forced
to
bear
the
responsibility
and
costs
associated
with
this
dereliction
of
duty
because
of
that
arizona
earlier
this
year
passed
and
signed
into
law
the
support
our
law
enforcement
and
safe
neighborhoods
act
to
better
equip
its
law
enforcement
officers
to
protect
citizens
and
legal
immigrants
residing
in
the
grand
canyon
state
although
opponents
have
spun
the
intent
and
effects
of
the
bill
in
actuality
the
arizona
immigration
law
mirrors
federal
law
which
already
requires
aliens
to
register
and
carry
their
documents
with
them
arizonas
law
simply
states
that
violating
federal
immigration
law
is
a
state
crime
as
well
because
illegal
immigrants
are
by
definition
in
violation
of
federal
immigration
laws
under
the
new
provisions
they
can
be
arrested
by
local
law
enforcement
in
arizona
despite
these
facts
the
department
of
justice
under
the
obama
administration
has
sued
arizona
in
the
lawsuit
challenging
the
arizona
statute
justice
officials
argue
although
states
may
exercise
their
police
power
in
a
manner
that
has
an
incidental
or
indirect
effect
on
aliens
a
state
may
not
establish
its
own
immigration
policy
or
enforce
state
laws
in
a
manner
that
interferes
with
the
federal
immigration
laws
the
constitution
and
the
federal
immigration
laws
do
not
permit
the
development
of
a
patchwork
of
state
and
local
immigration
policies
throughout
the
country
a
patchwork
of
immigration
enforcement
while
i
would
argue
the
arizona
law
does
not
constitute
a
patchwork
of
immigration
enforcement
it
appears
the
administrations
definition
is
limited
in
scope
for
if
a
patchwork
were
its
primary
concern
the
obama
administration
would
be
suing
sanctuary
cities
as
well
under
current
law
it
is
illegal
for
state
and
local
governments
to
prevent
their
police
forces
from
communicating
with
federal
immigration
enforcement
authorities
nonetheless
many
local
governments
have
adopted
sanctuary
city
policies
that
explicitly
prevent
their
police
officers
from
cooperating
with
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
agents
when
local
governments
refuse
to
share
information
with
federal
immigration
authorities
police
departments
often
arrest
criminal
aliens
only
to
release
them
without
ever
checking
their
immigration
status
as
a
result
instead
of
being
deported
many
of
those
aliens
move
on
to
commit
additional
and
sometimes
more
serious
criminal
offenses
although
sanctuary
cities
deliberately
disregard
our
nations
immigration
law
by
refusing
to
hand
over
illegal
immigrants
to
federal
authorities
they
have
hypocritically
begged
to
be
reimbursed
for
the
cost
of
jailing
illegal
immigrants
the
obama
administration
has
not
challenged
these
illegal
policies
in
court
and
it
has
doled
out
millions
of
taxpayer
dollars
to
sanctuary
cities
to
compensate
for
the
cost
of
jailing
illegal
immigrants
in
fact
in
2010
nearly
63
million
has
been
awarded
to
27
jurisdictions
widely
considered
to
be
sanctuary
jurisdictions
according
to
the
center
for
immigration
studies
apparently
if
you
are
a
sanctuary
city
you
can
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too
rather
than
limited
federal
dollars
being
awarded
to
those
jurisdictions
that
make
a
mockery
of
our
nations
immigration
laws
these
funds
should
be
allocated
only
to
those
local
law
enforcement
agencies
that
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
to
this
extent
i
have
authored
legislation
that
would
prohibit
sanctuary
cities
from
receiving
both
justice
and
department
of
homeland
security
funds
but
this
is
beside
the
point
if
the
administration
is
serious
about
making
sure
we
have
a
uniform
immigration
policy
it
needs
to
go
after
sanctuary
cities
this
would
be
consistent
policy
however
justice
has
stated
that
it
will
not
prosecute
sanctuary
jurisdictions
rather
the
administration
has
rewarded
sanctuary
jurisdictions
with
federal
dollars
set
aside
for
the
same
policies
they
deliberately
ignore
as
a
result
of
these
actions
we
can
gather
that
the
obama
administrations
definition
for
patchwork
of
immigration
enforcement
is
limited
to
those
who
seek
to
enforce
federal
immigration
law
and
does
not
encompass
those
who
seek
to
undermine
it
for
the
sake
of
consistency
and
the
safety
of
our
communities
it
is
time
to
end
the
double
standard
