length
848
words
as
the
senate
starts
debating
immigration
legislation
this
week
missing
will
be
one
of
the
most
important
elements
for
any
meaningful
immigration
reform
thats
the
need
to
cut
legal
immigration
in
fact
the
bill
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
goes
the
wrong
direction
it
would
blow
the
lid
off
some
legal
immigrant
visas
almost
doubling
the
permanent
resident
visas
allotted
yearly
and
giving
out
thousands
more
temporary
visas
not
only
would
the
senate
bill
bring
in
markedly
more
foreigners
through
supposed
legal
routes
it
would
amnesty
the
10
million
to
12
million
illegal
aliens
already
in
this
country
this
profligate
approach
is
a
recipe
for
disaster
why
is
the
senate
going
the
wrong
direction
as
compared
with
the
us
houses
enforcementfirst
approach
do
we
need
higher
legal
immigration
as
elitists
suggest
1
legal
immigration
and
illegal
immigration
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
high
legal
immigration
means
high
illegal
immigration
when
weve
had
lower
legal
immigration
weve
experienced
less
illegal
immigration
the
foreignborn
share
of
the
us
population
has
risen
sharply
over
the
last
40
years
so
has
the
illegal
alien
component
of
the
foreignborn
population
illegal
aliens
made
up
21
percent
of
the
foreignborn
in
1980
a
quarter
in
2000
and
28
percent
in
2005
half
of
the
top
10
source
countries
are
also
top
illegal
alien
senders
these
include
el
salvador
china
the
dominican
republic
and
the
philippines
2
mexico
is
the
biggest
source
of
both
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
thirty
percent
of
the
foreignborn
are
mexicans
and
more
than
half
of
usresident
mexicans
are
illegal
aliens
mexicans
make
up
3
times
the
proportion
of
the
next
three
sending
countries
combined
china
philippines
india
mexicans
will
clearly
benefit
the
most
from
much
higher
immigration
and
from
another
amnesty
leading
to
more
of
the
same
immigration
troubles
down
the
line
in
spades
3
amnesties
have
exacerbated
our
immigration
problems
in
many
ways
this
one
will
be
no
different
the
illegal
population
replenished
itself
in
less
than
a
decade
following
the
1986
amnesty
the
number
of
illegal
alien
residents
doubled
from
1990
to
2000
from
35
million
to
7
million
by
2005
about
10
million
illegal
aliens
lived
in
the
united
states
more
than
triple
the
number
of
irca
amnesty
recipients
triple
the
illegal
alien
population
in
1980
and
twice
the
level
of
illegal
immigration
in
1996
the
several
mass
amnesties
over
the
last
two
decades
severely
mask
the
degree
of
illegal
immigration
the
1986
irca
amnesty
legalized
3
million
aliens
threefourths
were
mexican
amnestees
gained
full
eligibility
to
sponsor
additional
immigrants
which
swelled
the
ranks
of
both
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
in
fact
many
new
immigrants
who
receive
a
permanent
resident
visa
each
year
have
lived
in
america
illegally
for
years
the
new
immigrant
survey
found
immediate
family
immigrants
who
first
came
unlawfully
typically
made
2
to
4
trips
illegally
they
lived
here
5
to
8
years
before
legalization
4
the
ability
to
have
anchor
babies
and
the
phenomenon
of
chain
migration
provide
more
lawbreaking
opportunities
the
senate
legislation
ignores
these
critical
flaws
an
estimated
onetenth
of
us
births
380000
in
2002
are
to
illegal
aliens
birthright
citizenship
of
their
americanborn
child
allows
illegals
a
firmer
foothold
here
an
overly
generous
legal
immigration
preference
system
gives
visas
to
grown
children
and
their
inlaws
aunts
uncles
and
cousins
and
visa
lotto
winners
ahead
of
nuclear
family
members
of
legal
permanent
residents
and
regardless
of
individuals
ability
to
contribute
to
americas
national
interest
this
antifamily
policy
keeps
parents
and
minor
children
husbands
and
wives
apart
longer
it
gives
an
incentive
for
illegal
immigration
such
chain
migration
creates
an
entitlement
mentality
by
bestowing
technical
visa
eligibility
on
millions
of
distant
relatives
and
puts
immigration
an
autopilot
5
the
new
immigrant
survey
confirmed
the
inextricable
link
between
legal
and
illegal
immigration
it
found
twothirds
of
adult
immigrants
had
spent
time
in
this
country
before
receiving
a
permanent
visa
a
third
illegally
for
mexicans
surveyed
57
percent
had
illegally
crossed
the
border
and
9
percent
overstayed
an
expired
visa
instead
of
increasing
legal
immigration
and
thereby
exacerbating
illegal
immigration
congress
should
cut
legal
immigration
levels
by
half
or
more
this
would
reduce
illegal
immigration
too
if
history
serves
as
guide
we
already
allot
more
than
a
million
immigrant
visas
a
year
this
is
4
times
higher
than
traditional
levels
from
1776
to
1965
this
nation
of
immigrants
averaged
230000
immigrants
annually
and
nearly
50
million
foreign
workers
immigrants
and
their
children
already
live
here
we
cant
possibly
need
the
volume
the
senate
would
add
