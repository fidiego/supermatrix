washington
president
bill
clinton
who
can
be
relied
upon
to
be
all
over
the
map
has
endorsed
changes
in
immigration
law
in
response
to
recommendations
from
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
its
difficult
to
guess
why
the
president
endorsed
the
minor
adjustments
in
numbers
and
eligibility
that
the
commission
proposed
but
c
the
debate
over
immigration
will
not
end
here
like
all
of
the
important
intellectual
debates
currently
engaging
serious
people
the
debate
over
immigration
is
being
waged
not
by
conservatives
against
liberals
but
by
conservatives
against
other
conservatives
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
isnt
a
liberal
position
on
immigration
there
is
it
amounts
to
this
if
people
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
move
to
america
they
are
entitled
to
all
of
the
benefits
of
our
welfare
state
the
minute
they
arrive
further
immigration
is
good
for
america
because
it
promotes
diversity
among
conservatives
the
debate
looks
a
little
different
most
conservatives
like
house
majority
leader
dick
armey
are
energetically
proimmigration
believing
that
immigration
adds
a
constant
fuel
of
economic
vitality
patriotism
and
energy
to
the
american
mix
immigration
enthusiasts
point
out
that
immigration
is
selfselecting
that
is
the
indolent
and
stupid
dont
have
what
it
takes
to
get
here
and
they
cite
the
brilliant
heritage
of
this
country
as
a
haven
for
the
oppressed
carrying
the
antiimmigration
standard
is
national
review
the
conservative
flagship
magazine
and
forbes
editor
peter
brimelow
author
of
alien
nation
common
sense
about
americas
immigration
disaster
both
brimelow
and
john
osullivan
national
reviews
editor
are
britishborn
and
though
it
may
seem
cheeky
for
immigrants
to
criticize
immigration
policy
brimelows
response
is
that
immigrants
always
do
the
dirty
work
in
america
and
today
the
dirty
work
amounts
to
challenging
illfounded
assumptions
about
immigration
few
americans
recognize
that
even
leaving
illegal
immigration
aside
we
are
now
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
wave
of
immigration
in
our
history
the
last
great
peak
1285349
came
in
1907
in
1991
we
accepted
1827167
yes
our
population
is
larger
today
but
as
brimelow
notes
and
as
any
resident
of
miami
or
san
diego
can
attest
immigrants
do
not
spread
themselves
evenly
around
the
country
but
rather
cluster
in
certain
cities
moreover
nearly
all
immigrants
who
come
to
america
these
days
are
staying
here
that
wasnt
true
of
the
great
wave
of
18801925
as
many
as
onethird
of
the
immigrants
who
came
during
that
period
eventually
went
back
home
indeed
throughout
american
history
the
decades
of
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
being
the
exception
immigration
has
ebbed
and
flowed
depending
upon
many
factors
including
economic
conditions
in
the
united
states
but
since
1965
immigration
legal
and
illegal
has
gone
steadily
up
why
well
the
welfare
state
explains
brimelow
the
image
we
have
of
hardworking
immigrants
making
a
go
of
it
in
the
new
land
with
long
hours
and
steady
toil
is
no
longer
accurate
he
claims
immigrants
have
become
heavy
users
of
welfare
according
to
brimelow
immigrants
consumed
67
percent
of
all
welfare
cash
benefits
in
1970
but
131
percent
in
1990
and
word
has
spread
about
what
is
obtainable
here
twothirds
of
the
births
in
los
angeles
county
are
to
illegalimmigrant
mothers
one
neednt
endorse
brimelows
conclusion
he
wants
a
complete
moratorium
on
immigration
for
a
few
years
and
then
a
reappraisal
of
immigration
policy
to
agree
that
the
questions
he
raises
are
worthy
of
debate
i
believe
that
the
traditional
image
of
the
hardworking
immigrant
is
still
true
for
most
but
if
even
a
significant
minority
are
departing
from
that
model
it
means
trouble
unless
we
become
again
a
nation
that
insists
upon
hard
work
and
selfreliance
a
nation
that
proudly
asks
immigrants
to
americanize
rather
than
hang
on
to
their
native
languages
and
customs
the
new
york
school
system
now
offers
instruction
in
100
different
languages
we
cannot
hope
to
assimilate
the
numbers
of
immigrants
we
are
now
accepting
and
unassimilated
minorities
can
be
a
very
serious
matter
