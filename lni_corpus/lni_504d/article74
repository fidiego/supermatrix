1697
words
at
the
recent
republican
statewide
meeting
in
a
north
central
phoenix
church
pews
were
packed
with
party
loyalists
listening
to
elected
officials
speak
about
issues
facing
the
state
and
the
nation
but
the
topic
that
would
have
dominated
the
conversation
in
past
years
illegal
immigration
was
scarcely
mentioned
maricopa
county
sheriff
joe
arpaio
one
of
the
nations
most
highprofile
opponents
of
illegal
immigration
noticed
and
told
the
crowd
not
to
get
soft
on
him
i
hope
the
topic
of
immigration
isnt
going
away
and
everybody
doesnt
surrender
arpaio
told
the
crowd
former
state
senate
president
russell
pearce
also
spoke
lambasting
the
federal
government
and
noting
a
few
of
his
accomplishments
opposing
illegal
immigration
but
no
other
speaker
broached
the
topic
after
his
speech
pearce
said
the
subject
of
illegal
immigration
is
not
going
away
in
arizona
even
if
its
no
longer
a
hot
topic
with
his
fellow
republicans
especially
those
in
leadership
at
the
state
capitol
pearce
said
the
bills
the
legislature
has
passed
worked
noting
that
many
illegal
immigrants
have
selfdeported
or
left
arizona
that
violent
crime
is
down
and
that
there
are
fewer
illegal
immigrant
children
in
the
public
education
system
you
dont
need
a
lot
more
bills
you
need
enforcement
he
said
weve
done
our
job
at
the
legislature
i
think
there
are
some
tweaks
to
be
done
but
we
won
back
at
the
arizona
capitol
things
arent
what
they
were
in
2010
when
pearce
was
at
the
helm
of
the
senate
illegal
immigration
isnt
mentioned
in
most
debates
the
republicansponsored
measures
of
previous
years
gain
no
traction
with
the
house
and
senate
leaders
who
are
focused
on
job
creation
and
improving
the
state
budget
in
pearces
day
deporting
illegal
immigrants
was
considered
a
way
to
create
jobs
and
bolster
the
budget
senate
bill
1070
in
2010
was
the
pinnacle
of
the
antiimmigration
movement
in
arizona
 its
passage
marked
the
moment
when
immigration
hawks
told
the
federal
government
they
werent
going
to
wait
for
it
to
take
on
the
problem
that
arizona
would
handle
its
immigration
problems
alone
if
necessary
but
less
than
a
year
after
the
bill
was
signed
into
law
the
wave
of
anti
immigration
rhetoric
in
arizona
subsided
on
march
17
2011
pearce
and
his
supporters
put
five
antiimmigration
bills
up
for
a
vote
by
the
full
senate
even
with
pearce
shepherding
the
bills
through
and
with
a
republican
supermajority
in
both
chambers
the
bills
failed
handily
later
that
year
pearce
lost
a
historic
recall
election
in
his
district
by
wide
margins
sending
a
chilling
signal
to
toughonimmigration
lawmakers
smith
still
fighting
the
only
republican
legislator
still
keeping
up
the
fight
at
the
state
capitol
the
only
one
who
has
introduced
any
antiimmigration
legislation
this
session
is
rep
steve
smith
 he
reintroduced
two
of
those
five
failed
2011
immigration
measures
again
in
2012
and
this
session
though
they
didnt
gain
any
traction
last
year
when
legislative
leadership
called
for
a
cooling
off
period
for
immigration
measures
smith
is
hoping
the
bills
will
gain
the
support
of
the
majority
of
his
caucus
this
year
or
at
least
get
a
hearing
his
hb2293
which
would
require
hospitals
to
contact
law
enforcement
if
they
cannot
verify
the
citizenship
of
a
patient
was
assigned
to
the
house
health
committee
but
has
not
yet
been
scheduled
for
a
hearing
house
bill
2289
which
would
require
schools
to
collect
data
on
students
who
are
enrolled
in
school
and
cannot
prove
lawful
residence
in
the
united
states
has
not
been
assigned
to
a
committee
he
also
introduced
hb2283
which
would
reduce
requirements
for
state
agencies
to
publish
information
in
languages
other
than
english
allowing
them
to
post
spanish
versions
of
documents
only
online
and
maintain
a
spanish
copy
at
their
office
that
bill
is
scheduled
for
a
hearing
in
the
house
government
committee
the
bills
all
aim
to
either
quantify
or
minimize
the
costs
of
illegal
immigration
to
the
state
he
said
if
lawmakers
honestly
care
about
budgets
about
spending
problems
about
taxpayer
money
then
these
bills
will
help
address
all
those
issues
he
said
unlike
pearce
smith
doesnt
think
the
legislatures
work
is
finished
when
it
comes
to
border
and
immigration
issues
when
we
had
multiple
immigration
bills
introduced
in
the
senate
in
2011
you
had
some
republicans
stand
up
and
say
lets
give
it
a
rest
so
maybe
some
people
have
sb
1070
fatigue
i
dont
know
he
said
but
i
know
that
was
years
ago
and
the
last
time
i
checked
1070
did
not
solve
all
our
border
and
immigration
problems
he
said
he
has
softened
his
legislation
over
the
years
and
he
hopes
lawmakers
who
had
immigration
fatigue
last
year
have
rested
and
are
ready
to
continue
the
fight
but
most
of
smiths
colleagues
who
came
into
office
in
2008
and
2010
on
promises
of
solving
the
illegal
immigration
problems
are
more
muted
on
the
topic
now
melvin
enforcement
needed
sen
al
melvin
rsaddle
brooke
sponsored
four
of
the
five
immigration
bills
that
died
in
the
senate
in
2011
melvin
and
smith
rmaricopa
both
represent
district
11
after
redistricting
forced
the
two
into
the
same
district
and
led
smith
to
move
to
the
house
to
avoid
a
primary
battle
but
this
year
melvin
has
signed
on
to
only
one
borderrelated
bill
he
is
the
prime
sponsor
of
a
measure
to
continue
the
office
of
sonora
set
up
to
facilitate
communications
and
the
exchange
of
information
among
companies
individuals
private
organizations
and
governmental
agencies
of
sonora
mexico
and
arizona
melvin
said
he
will
support
smiths
bills
if
they
arrive
in
the
senate
and
he
rattled
off
a
list
of
problems
the
state
still
faces
involving
illegal
immigration
but
melvin
said
he
wasnt
sponsoring
any
antiillegal
immigration
legislation
because
there
are
other
big
issues
that
need
to
be
dealt
with
and
passing
a
bill
like
sb1070
every
year
doesnt
make
sense
we
need
to
enforce
the
laws
that
are
on
the
books
he
said
democrats
push
agenda
meanwhile
democrats
are
trying
to
put
a
different
set
of
laws
on
the
books
and
have
pushed
their
own
immigration
agenda
though
its
still
likely
to
go
nowhere
in
the
republicandominated
legislature
this
year
far
more
democratic
bills
have
been
filed
on
immigration
than
republican
bills
and
although
they
usually
cant
get
their
legislation
passed
democrats
are
hopeful
 they
say
the
tone
the
conversation
and
the
momentum
have
shifted
at
the
state
capitol
assistant
house
minority
leader
ruben
gallego
dphoenix
said
democrats
have
taken
the
offensive
on
immigration
even
though
they
cant
accomplish
what
they
would
like
back
in
the
day
there
were
a
couple
of
us
who
were
screaming
lonely
in
the
woods
and
the
tide
was
on
the
side
of
the
russell
pearces
and
the
arpaios
of
the
world
now
clearly
the
tide
has
changed
he
said
noting
that
pearce
has
been
recalled
and
arpaio
narrowly
won
his
most
recent
election
gallego
said
that
nationally
republicans
have
seen
the
writing
on
the
wall
that
latinos
are
becoming
an
increasingly
large
portion
of
the
population
and
are
increasingly
turning
away
from
the
gop
and
that
even
at
the
capitol
republicans
are
moderating
their
stances
on
immigration
gallego
said
pearce
and
melvin
didnt
believe
the
laws
on
the
books
were
sufficient
when
they
were
pushing
the
failed
measures
of
2011
and
he
pointed
to
pearce
as
a
major
factor
in
president
barack
obamas
wide
margin
among
latinos
over
republican
mitt
romney
when
people
were
out
talking
to
the
latino
community
they
would
talk
about
the
arizona
bills
and
how
russell
pearce
and
mitt
romney
had
the
same
views
on
immigration
gallego
said
i
know
because
i
did
it
the
national
approach
in
many
ways
what
is
happening
in
arizona
politics
now
mirrors
what
is
happening
at
the
federal
level
following
his
victory
in
which
three
out
of
four
latinos
chose
him
as
their
leader
obama
has
again
put
immigration
near
the
top
of
his
agenda
and
arizonas
two
republican
us
senators
jeff
flake
and
john
mccain
are
leading
the
national
conversation
on
immigration
reform
with
their
recentlyannounced
bipartisan
proposal
that
would
offer
illegal
immigrants
a
path
to
citizenship
democratic
us
rep
raul
grijalva
of
southern
arizona
stood
on
the
capitol
lawn
shortly
after
the
proposal
was
announced
offering
rare
praise
of
arizonas
republican
us
senators
and
the
plan
he
said
arizonas
strong
stance
against
illegal
immigration
galvanized
people
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
and
has
provided
an
impetus
for
the
shift
toward
comprehensive
federal
immigration
reform
i
think
its
been
a
doubleedged
sword
one
side
to
try
to
get
something
passed
at
the
national
level
so
states
wouldnt
do
what
was
done
here
and
its
also
galvanized
the
enforcementonly
people
to
not
look
at
the
other
aspects
of
immigration
grijalva
said
while
pearce
said
his
side
won
the
immigration
debate
in
arizona
immigrant
rights
groups
say
he
only
won
a
battle
with
sb1070
that
the
war
is
still
going
and
the
momentum
is
on
their
side
raquel
teran
statewide
director
of
mi
familia
vota
said
the
state
capitol
isnt
the
hotbed
of
antiimmigrant
rhetoric
it
was
a
few
years
ago
she
noted
a
lot
of
that
has
to
do
with
efforts
to
register
more
latinos
to
vote
latino
involvement
in
the
elections
increased
from
16
percent
in
2010
to
18
percent
in
2012
 her
group
alone
registered
more
than
15000
new
voters
in
that
timeframe
as
well
as
adding
48000
voters
to
the
permanent
early
voter
list
she
said
immigrant
rights
groups
are
raising
a
new
class
of
politically
savvy
latino
citizens
through
their
efforts
to
educate
and
involve
young
latinos
adios
arpaio
a
political
action
committee
that
focused
on
registering
new
voters
in
their
failed
attempt

oust

staffed
mostly
by
high
school
volunteers

has
become
part
of
the
decisionmaking
