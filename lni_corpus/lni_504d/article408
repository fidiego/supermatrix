republican
leaders
in
congress
are
divided
over
when
and
where
to
launch
their
promised
legislative
offensive
on
immigration
this
year
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
incoming
chairman
of
the
senate
immigration
subcommittee
has
a
bill
ready
to
introduce
right
away
that
would
substantially
cut
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
entering
the
country
meanwhile
rep
lamar
s
smith
rtex
incoming
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
panel
says
he
wants
to
focus
on
illegal
immigration
and
take
his
time
developing
a
comprehensive
bill
even
if
final
action
doesnt
come
until
early
1996
deciding
whether
to
focus
on
legal
or
illegal
immigration
and
whether
to
move
quickly
whichever
direction
they
go
are
only
two
of
the
unresolved
matters
facing
the
republican
leadership
on
this
issue
highimmigration
states
especially
california
are
certain
again
to
seek
reimbursement
for
government
expenses
related
to
illegal
immigration
adding
to
the
competing
demands
at
a
time
of
budget
tightening
many
republicans
favor
some
kind
of
computerized
system
to
verify
eligibility
for
employment
and
benefits
but
there
are
broad
differences
over
how
expensive
or
intrusive
such
a
system
should
be
disagreements
already
are
developing
over
the
welfare
reform
bill
proposed
by
house
republicans
which
virtually
would
eliminate
the
access
of
legal
immigrants
to
federal
benefit
programs
and
any
proposal
to
cut
legal
immigration
such
as
simpsons
is
certain
to
provoke
a
heated
internal
debate
underlying
these
fissures
are
some
complex
political
considerations
the
republicans
made
immigration
into
a
firstclass
hotbutton
issue
in
1994
but
it
is
not
obvious
what
they
should
do
now
to
guarantee
that
they
will
have
it
available
again
in
1996
said
a
senior
democratic
congressional
strategist
who
asked
not
to
be
named
do
you
start
a
fistfight
over
it
and
risk
polarizing
opinions
even
within
your
own
party
or
do
you
seek
consensus
the
democrat
said
do
you
try
to
ride
it
now
while
its
still
on
peoples
minds
or
do
you
wait
to
stoke
it
up
again
at
the
beginning
of
the
1996
primaries
they
dont
have
easy
answers
but
then
again
neither
do
we
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
several
cabinet
departments
delivered
detailed
options
for
potential
administrative
and
legislative
action
on
immigration
to
the
white
house
over
the
past
few
weeks
according
to
senior
administration
officials
president
clinton
and
his
senior
advisers
are
expected
to
make
strategic
decisions
before
the
end
of
the
month
about
where
immigration
fits
in
the
administrations
agenda
for
1995
while
immigration
developed
into
a
highly
partisan
issue
last
fall
in
the
context
of
the
californias
campaigns
for
governor
us
senator
and
proposition
187
republican
leaders
expect
to
continue
a
congressional
tradition
of
addressing
immigration
through
bipartisan
consensus
some
of
the
leadership
asked
me
to
draw
up
a
republican
immigration
bill
simpson
said
but
i
told
them
that
i
wasnt
comfortable
with
that
that
it
couldnt
be
done
smith
who
said
he
expects
to
work
closely
with
simpson
said
there
is
a
temptation
to
make
this
a
partisan
issue
and
force
something
through
congress
quickly
but
ultimately
i
do
not
think
that
would
produce
an
effective
solution
to
the
problem
my
goal
is
to
take
the
time
to
do
it
right
which
means
taking
the
time
to
build
bipartisan
support
and
public
support
for
a
comprehensive
approach
to
the
crisis
of
illegal
immigration
both
simpson
and
smith
are
on
the
record
as
saying
that
such
an
approach
must
include
some
kind
of
identity
system
perhaps
using
the
social
security
card
to
block
illegal
immigrants
access
to
jobs
and
public
benefits
but
virtually
all
such
suggestions
have
aroused
storms
of
opposition
in
the
past
on
the
basis
of
cost
and
practicality
as
well
as
claims
that
they
would
engender
invasions
of
privacy
and
discrimination
against
people
perceived
to
look
like
foreigners
recognizing
the
potential
for
controversy
smith
said
i
do
not
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
saying
that
i
favor
any
one
answer
this
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
a
lot
of
hearings
but
a
leisurely
legislative
schedule
may
not
satisfy
all
republicans
rep
dana
rohrabacher
rcalif
who
represents
some
of
the
orange
county
communities
that
were
in
the
forefront
of
the
proposition
187
campaign
said
we
are
already
behind
the
curve
when
it
comes
to
a
tamperproof
social
security
card
and
so
i
am
anxious
to
move
forward
as
quickly
as
possible
regardless
of
what
kind
of
immigration
legislation
moves
through
the
committee
process
rohrabacher
vowed
to
take
action
on
the
floor
to
ensure
that
every
appropriation
and
authorization
bill
has
language
prohibiting
federal
funds
from
ending
up
in
the
hands
of
illegal
immigrants
last
year
he
bedeviled
the
democratic
leadership
with
guerrilla
warfare
tactics
with
his
own
party
now
in
control
he
said
he
expects
to
get
votes
on
the
merits
of
his
case
in
their
frequent
crusades
against
illegal
immigration
many
republicans
like
smith
and
rohrabacher
have
insisted
they
have
nothing
against
legal
immigrants
now
that
some
in
their
party
are
proposing
action
on
legal
immigrants
however
they
find
themselves
in
a
difficult
position
smith
for
example
said
he
had
no
final
position
on
a
proposal
to
deny
welfare
benefits
to
legal
immigrants
and
rohrabacher
called
simpsons
plan
to
cut
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
very
harmful
