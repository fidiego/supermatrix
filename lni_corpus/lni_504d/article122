tea
party
support
must
be
weighed
against
not
upsetting
the
hispanic
caucus
for
evidence
of
the
political
minefield
that
is
immigration
reform
look
no
further
than
the
florida
senate
on
one
side
is
senate
president
mike
haridopolos
looking
to
attract
tea
party
conservatives
to
his
republican
bid
for
us
senate
and
others
in
the
gop
including
gov
rick
scott
who
want
to
show
they
are
taking
action
to
tackle
illegal
immigration
on
the
other
side
are
the
states
powerful
hispanic
caucus
and
some
of
the
biggest
special

in
florida
the
chamber
of

the

catholic

the
clergy
argues
a
crackdown
would
be
immoral
the
business
groups
worry
it
would
be
a
blow
to
the
states
limping
economy
all
of
this
puts
haridopolos
in
a
bind
as
a
senate
candidate
he
doesnt
just
need
conservative
voters
he
needs
cash
and
groups
like
the
chamber
aif
and
us
sugar
have
it
for
now
he
has
stayed
out
of
the
fray
taking
the
heat
is

tasked

commentators
on
the
spanishlanguage
airwaves
in
miami
have
likened
her
bill
to
a
controversial
immigration
law
in
arizona
that
has
been
partly
blocked
by
the
courts
flores
response
has
been
to
tell
critics
that
things
could
be
worse
without
her
a
cubanamerican
sensitive
to
the
feelings
of
hispanics
at
the
helm

an

is
going

pass

said
this
week
on
mega
tvs
maria
elvira
live
if
i
dont
do
it
someone
else
will
her
proposal
is
softer
than
the
one
headed
to
the
floor
of
the
state
house
which
would
make
being
undocumented
a
state
crime
in
addition
to
already
being
a
federal
offense
the
house
bill
goes
much
too
far
flores
said
thursday
the
house
version
would
also
require
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
a
person
who
is
the
subject
of
a
criminal
investigation
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
might
be
undocumented
the
senate
would
have
police
check
the
status
of
inmates
and
while
both
bills
would
mandate
employers
to
check
employees
immigration
status
the
senate
proposal
gives
employers
more
leeway
on
how
to
do
so
the
senate
stalled
debate
over
its
bill
until
after
next
weeks
passover
and
easter
holidays
meanwhile
scott
has
remained
steadfast
if
somebody
is
in
our
country
and
doing
something
illegal
they
should
be
asked
if
they
are
legal
or
not
if
theyre
stopped
by
law
enforcement
scott
said
earlier
this
week
business
and
tourism
groups
fear
approval
of
an
immigration
bill
will
hurt
their
bottom
line
the
mere
consideration
of
this
bill
is
causing
the
image
of
the
state
of
florida
to
be
tarnished
not
only
nationally
but
internationally

the

said
republican

ana
navarro
who
has
lobbied
for
immigration
reform
if
they
pass
something
that
is
viewed
as
anything
similar
to
arizona
law
it
could
very
well
wind
up
costing

the
house
bill
hb
7089
would
make
being
an
undocumented
immigrant
a
state
crime
it
is
already
a
federal
offense
it
also
requires

to
check
the

a

who
is
the

a

if
there

the
senate
bill
sb
2040
requires
police
to
check
the
status
of
an
inmate
it
also
encourages
police
departments
to
enter
into
agreements
with
the
federal
government
to
enforce
immigration
laws
both
bills
would
require
employers
to
check

gives
