oklahoma
immigration
law
should
respect
the
fundamental
dignity
of
all
human
beings
the
states
two
catholic
bishops
said
in
a
joint
statement
the
most
revs
edward
j
slattery
of
the
diocese
of
tulsa
and
paul
s
coakley
of
the
archdiocese
of
oklahoma
city
issued
the
statement
in
response
to
tougher
immigration
laws
being
considered
by
the
oklahoma
legislature
what
were
trying
to
do
is
create
an
attitude
of
kindness
and
justice
slattery
said
tuesday
theres
a
sentiment
here
of
harshness
in
the
law
and
in
the
rhetoric
its
not
christian
we
felt
compelled
to
say
something
the
statement
said
the
bishops
were
concerned
that
the
immigration
bills
will
have
the
intentional
or
unintentional
effect
of
instilling
fear
in
an
already
vulnerable
population
no
legislation
can
undo
the
reality
that
every
human
being
is
our
brother
and
the
duty
of
making
oneself
a
neighbor
to
others
and
actively
serving
them
becomes
even
more
urgent
when
it
involves
the
disadvantaged
the
bishops
said
the
oklahoma
house
early
this
month
overwhelmingly
passed
house
bill
1446
written
by
rep
george
faught
rmuskogee
that
contains
sections
of
the
arizona
immigration
law
the
bill
is
now
in
the
senate
it
would
make
it
a
crime
to
pick
up
illegal
immigrants
for
the
purpose
of
hiring
them
require
employers
to
verify
immigration
status
of
potential
employees
allow
state
agencies
to
report
illegal
immigrants
who
apply
for
state
or
federal
aid
bar
illegal
immigrants
from
seeking
work
as
independent
contractors
or
getting
college
tuition
assistance
allow
police
with
federal
training
to
question
motorists
about
their
immigration
status
and
allow
police
to
seize
vehicles
and
property
used
in
immigration
violations

bill

bill

by
sen
ralph
shortey
roklahoma
city
is
pending
in
the
house
the
bishops
statement
said
the
church
recognizes
the
right
of
governments
to
protect
their
sovereign
borders
the
bishops
said
they
prayed
the
federal
government
would
enact
fair
and
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
acknowledges
us
dependence
on
undocumented
workers
provides
them
a
living
wage
and
decent
working
conditions
and
offers
them
a
path
to
legal
status
we
pray
that
the
decisions
of
our
elected
state
officials
will
be
guided
by
a
search
for
the
common
good
of
all
and
not
on
narrow
economic
or
political
interests
which
fail
to
protect
and
promote
human
dignity
family
unity
and
children
