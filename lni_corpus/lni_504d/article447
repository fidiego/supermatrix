2the
punches
keep
coming
from
both
sides
but
the
slugfest
over
immigration
may
be
losing
some
of
its
urgency
as
activists
try
to
ratchet
up
pressure
on
president
barack
obama
to
halt
deportations
and
work
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
political
experts
predict
he
wont
take
dramatic
action
anytime
soon
because
of
the
economy
the
war
and
need
for
healthcare
reform
a
poll
by
the
pew
hispanic
center
suggests
that
even
latinos
are
pushing
immigration
down
their
list
of
priorities
the
december
survey
of
1007
latinos
nationwide
said
only
one
in
three
people
identified
immigration
as
an
extremely
important
issue
on
a
list
of
the
nations
most
pressing
issues
that
was
led
by
the
economy
and
followed
by
education
healthcare
national
security
and
the
environment
immigration
ranked
sixth
immigration
is
very
important
but
its
not
as
important
as
stabilizing
the
economy
and
the
leadership
of
the
country
said
julio
gomez
a
real
estate
agent
from
oxnard
who
sees
immigration
protests
as
more
of
a
reminder
than
a
call
for
immediate
action
dont
let
politicians
forget
about
it
gomez
who
was
born
in
ecuador
is
a
citizen
who
legally
came
to
the
us
in
1987
activist
still
seeks
changes
alicia
flores
director
of
hermandad
mexicana
community
center
and
advocacy
group
in
oxnard
contends
some
of
the
latinos
who
are
pushing
immigration
down
their
list
of
priorities
are
third
and
fourthgeneration
immigrants
she
said
theyre
buffered
from
the
daily
injustices
of
immigration
enforcement
deported
parents
separated
from
their
children
and
young
adults
who
cant
go
to
college
because
theyre
not
eligible
for
financial
aid
flores
helped
to
organize
a
drive
in
which
5000
ventura
county
residents
signed
a
letter
to
president
obama
urging
his
support
for
immigration
reform
they
asked
for
an
immediate
halt
to
deportation
and
workplace
raids
the
latino
community
overwhelmingly
came
out
in
support
of
your
candidacy
the
letter
reads
flores
attended
obamas
inauguration
shivering
in
the
washington
dc
cold
with
more
than
1
million
other
people
the
next
day
she
carried
an
immigration
reform
sign
at
a
rally
aimed
at
the
new
president
obama
said
on
the
day
he
won
the
election
im
not
going
to
do
the
change
you
have
to
do
the
change
said
flores
who
believes
applying
pressure
is
the
way
to
make
sure
change
happens
many
immigration
activists
say
providing
a
path
to
legal
residency
would
help
the
economy
by
reducing
the
illegal
immigrants
who
are
compensated
in
cash
and
dont
pay
taxes
flores
director
of
the
hermandad
mexicana
advocacy
group
in
oxnard
thinks
reform
will
spur
spending
through
a
domino
effect
as
simple
as
enabling
illegal
immigrants
to
get
drivers
licenses
and
buy
cars
and
insurance
some
want
all
immigration
slowed
but
as
groups
like
the
league
of
united
latin
american
citizens
say
they
want
comprehensive
reform
on
the
table
within
three
months
others
cite
the
economy
as
justification
for
stopping
the
flow
of
illegal
immigration
it
seems
to
me
if
american
labor
is
hurting
the
single
best
way
to
get
americans
back
to
work
is
to
tighten
up
the
labor
market
said
michael
lief
a
ventura
lawyer
who
advocates
more
enforcement
of
existing
immigration
laws
that
happens
by
not
bringing
millions
of
foreign
citizens
into
the
job
market
to
compete
with
unemployed
americans
a
group
called
numbersusa
is
pushing
obama
to
take
what
it
calls
a
timeout
not
only
on
illegal
immigration
but
also
on
the
flow
of
people
who
come
here
legally
how
can
it
make
any
sense
for
the
american
peoples
own
government
to
be
approving
more
competitors
for
a
dwindling
number
of
jobs
the
groups
leader
roy
beck
said
in
a
letter
to
obama
groups
courting
the
new
presidents
favor
are
trying
to
capitalize
on
the
theory
that
obama
will
have
a
honeymoon
period
that
enhances
his
ability
to
push
through
legislation
said
tom
hogenesch
political
science
professor
at
csu
northridge
their
battle
is
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
queue
said
hogenesch
who
thinks
the
economy
will
push
the
issue
to
a
backburner
professor
says
obama
needs
a
win
kareem
crayton
political
science
professor
at
usc
said
obama
wants
to
build
momentum
by
backing
issues
that
he
knows
will
win
congressional
support
immigration
reform
is
too
volatile
he
needs
a
win
and
its
not
quite
clear
that
immigration
is
a
sure
winner
crayton
said
its
more
likely
that
obama
will
concentrate
on
immigration
changes
that
can
be
enacted
without
congress
crayton
said
mark
krikorian
predicted
the
new
president
will
reduce
the
number
of
deportations
and
workplace
raids
as
a
way
to
appease
people
pushing
for
immigration
reform
he
may
push
the
voluntary
everify
online
systems
designed
to
help
employers
check
on
a
workers
immigration
status
its
too
politically
dangerous
for
the
president
to
push
for
comprehensive
reform
that
includes
a
path
to
residency
for
illegal
residents
said
krikorian
leader
of
a
center
for
immigration
studies
think
tank
that
advocates
more
enforcement
against
illegal
immigrants
but
he
does
think
obama
may
support
smaller
bills
like
the
dream
act
which
offers
legal
status
to
young
adults
who
were
brought
to
the
us
illegally
as
children
hes
going
to
throw
some
bones
to
the
proamnesty
crowd
krikorian
said
some
of
the
people
walking
to
their
cars
outside
an
oxnard
walmart
arent
looking
for
bones
they
want
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants
i
see
more
us
citizens
who
are
here
for
welfare
and
there
are
these
hardworking
people
who
are
getting
sent
back
said
amber
arroyo
who
is
26
and
cleans
houses
for
a
living
others
think
obamas
priority
list
should
have
one
item
the
economy
of
course
said
a
filipino
woman
who
offered
this
solution
improve
it
do
something
jose
hernandez
a
26yearold
cook
from
oxnard
is
in
the
middle
he
thinks
people
living
here
illegally
need
to
be
able
to
come
out
of
the
shadows
but
he
thinks
the
key
to
virtually
all
of
the
countrys
problems
is
marked
by
dollar
signs
once
we
get
the
economy
everything
will
be
fixed
