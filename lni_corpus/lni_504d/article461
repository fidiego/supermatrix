stung
by
mounting
criticism
of
the
nations
immigration
courts
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
on
tuesday
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
launching
a
comprehensive
review
of
how
the
immigration
system
is
handling
the
pleas
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
and
others
fighting
deportation
each
year
in
memos
delivered
to
every
immigration
judge
in
the
country
gonzales
expressed
dismay
at
reports
of
poor
treatment
of
aliens
in
the
immigration
system
citing
intemperate
or
even
abusive
conduct
he
declared
that
the
work
of
the
immigration
courts
must
improve
the
immigration
courts
are
under
the
control
of
the
attorney
general
and
justice
department
gonzales
call
for
an
examination
of
the
immigration
courts
has
been
triggered
by
a
steady
barrage
of
criticism
from
immigrant
rights
advocates
and
federal
judges
whose
courts
have
been
inundated
with
appeals
from
refugees
and
other
noncitizens
who
insist
their
immigration
cases
are
getting
short
shrift
a
san
jose
mercury
news
series
last
fall
found
noncitizens
often
get
rapidfire
justice
in
the
immigration
courts
particularly
since
postsept
11
reforms
downsized
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
is
responsible
for
reviewing
the
work
of
the
nations
215
immigration
judges
the
bia
has
been
deciding
many
cases
including
life
and
death
pleas
for
asylum
in
perfunctory
boilerplate
orders
those
decisions
are
being
appealed
and
overturned
in
the
federal
appeals
courts
in
unprecedented
numbers
the
mercury
news
found
now
gonzales
has
ordered
a
toptobottom
review
of
the
system
more
than
three
years
after
former
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
streamlined
the
immigration
courts
to
push
more
cases
through
faster
and
clear
a
backlog
as
the
agency
tried
to
focus
on
keeping
terrorists
out
of
the
country
weve
been
encouraging
this
sort
of
thing
to
happen
said
mary
schroeder
the
chief
judge
of
the
san
franciscobased
9th
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
hit
hardest
by
a
surge
in
immigration
appeals
this
system
needs
to
be
improved
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
a
spokesman
for
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
which
oversees
the
immigration
courts
declined
comment
on
the
gonzales
memos
denise
slavin
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
told
the
associated
press
she
welcomes
the
review
we
think
the
premise
of
the
review
may
be
somewhat
faulty
but
hopefully
it
will
allow
us
to
get
some
additional
resources
slavin
said
gonzales
did
not
include
specifics
in
his
memos
but
most
of
the
attention
in
the
past
year
has
been
focused
on
the
lax
level
of
review
in
the
bia
and
cases
where
hasty
or
mistakeprone
decisions
by
overworked
immigration
judges
were
allowed
to
slip
through
the
cracks
immigration
judges
handled
more
than
300000
cases
last
year
including
tens
of
thousands
of
cases
where
asylumseekers
many
fearing
torture
or
death
if
returned
to
their
homelands
rely
on
the
immigration
courts
as
their
last
hope
to
stay
in
the
united
states
the
cursory
review
of
immigration
cases
has
had
profound
consequences
forcing
many
noncitizens
to
put
their
lives
on
hold
as
they
wait
for
years
until
they
find
out
whether
they
will
be
deported
in
one
case
reviewed
by
the
mercury
news
the
9th
circuit
had
to
revive
the
asylum
claims
of
a
guatemalan
refugee
whose
case
was
rejected
by
the
bia
without
an
explanation
she
was
granted
asylum
last
summer
after
six
years
of
uncertainty
the
9th
circuit
which
covers
california
and
eight
other
western
states
has
been
particularly
tough
on
the
immigration
courts
the
mercury
news
found
that
nearly
twothirds
of
the
most
important
immigration
cases
in
the
west
are
so
flawed
when
they
emerge
from
the
bia
they
have
to
be
sent
back
for
further
review
other
federal
courts
have
stepped
up
the
criticism
as
well
in
late
december
a
chicagobased
federal
appeals
court
wrote
that
decisions
coming
from
the
immigration
courts
have
fallen
below
the
minimum
standards
of
legal
justice
since
ashcrofts
reforms
were
put
in
place
the
numbers
of
immigration
appeals
to
the
federal
courts
have
jumped
from
1760
in
2001
to
nearly
11000
last
year
the
9th
circuit
now
hears
half
of
all
of
those
appeals
going
from
954
immigration
cases
to
nearly
6000
in
2005
immigration
experts
say
it
is
particularly
important
for
gonzales
to
devise
meaningful
reforms
because
a
new
law
passed
by
congress
reduces
the
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
secondguess
immigration
judges
in
many
asylum
cases
in
addition
the
bush
administration
is
pushing
immigration
reforms
that
could
add
burdens
on
the
immigration
system
lawyers
who
represent
refugees
while
skeptical
are
hopeful
gonzales
will
act
on
his
concerns
i
think
hes
heard
the
hue
and
cry
from
many
quarters
about
this

deborah
notkin

of

american
immigration
lawyers
