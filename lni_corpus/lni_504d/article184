the
new
immigration
law
in
arizona
and
recent
events
in
greenfield
are
giving
a
new
impetus
to
traditional
local
may
1
immigration
reform
gatherings
arizona
is
causing
a
crisis
its
a
very
difficult
situation
but
it
also
brings
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
issues
said
efren
barajas
vice
president
of
the
united
farm
workers
and
an
organizer
for
saturdays
event
when
you
dont
take
action
at
the
national
level
local
jurisdictions
are
taking
the
wrong
approach
were
taking
this
development
as
a
step
to
keep
climbing
towards
immigration
reform
a
march
is
planned
5
pm
saturday
in
watsonville
followed
by
a
town
hall
meeting
7
pm
in
salinas
organizers
are
asking
elected
officials
and
law
enforcement
representatives
to
pledge
their
commitment
at
the
town
hall
meeting
to
immigration
reform
and
to
refrain
from
acting
as
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agents
that
idea
came
from
looking
at
whats
happening
in
arizona
barajas
said
the
law
signed
by
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
on
friday
makes
it
a
state
crime
to
be
in
the
country
without
proper
documents
it
allows
police
to
stop
people
they
suspect
of
being
undocumented
immigrants
and
to
ask
to
see
their
papers
critics
say
the
law
will
lead
to
racial
profiling
and
is
a
state
usurpation
of
federal
authority
the
american
civil
liberties
union
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
and
the
national
immigration
law
center
are
set
to
announce
today
a
legal
challenge
to
the
law
immigration
has
been
a
hot
topic
in
greenfield
where
more
than
200
residents
attended
tuesdays
city
council
meeting
many
of
them
asking
officials
not
to
repeal
the
citys
immigration
sanctuary
policy
which
demands
that
federal
agents
give
the
city
72hours
notice
if
they
plan
to
conduct
immigration
sweeps
the
policy
has
come
into
question
in
recent
letters
published
by
a
local
newspaper
and
at
previous
council
meetings
some
residents
blamed
the
citys
misfortunes
on
the
oaxacan
population
indigenous
immigrants
from
southern
mexico
the
letters
have
asked
city
leaders
to
repeal
its
sanctuary
resolution
city
attorney
john
bakker
said
tuesday
during
the
meeting
that
federal
law
trumps
local
resolutions
thats
why
so
many
people
attended
tuesday
theres
so
much
worry
barajas
said
this
town
used
to
be
an
example
of
cooperation
with
officials
and
these
verbal
attacks
they
have
spread
throughout
the
valley
theres
oaxacan
immigrants
in
every
town
and
we
have
to
fight
it
before
it
spreads
a
major
concern
is
that
police
will
begin
acting
like
their
arizona
counterparts
checking
people
for
proper
documents
its
the
same
attitude
that
turns
police
officers
in
immigration
agents
and
when
we
saw
whats
happening
in
arizona
and
greenfield
we
said
we
have
to
put
a
stop
to
this
barajas
said
it
appears
no
law
enforcement
agency
in
monterey
county
uses
the
federal
provision
that
allows
police
officers
to
act
as
immigration
agents
said
sheriffs
spokesman
cmdr
mike
richards
our
cooperation
with
ice
is
limited
to
our
fingerprint
system
connected
to
their
database
richards
said
when
they
do
periodical
sweeps
in
area
we
assist
with
personnel
but
the
sheriffs
position
regarding
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
is
to
stay
hands
off
we
pretty
much
feel
this
is
the
job
of
ice
we
dont
have
the
time
or
resources
to
deal
with
immigration
except
in
a
asneeded
basis
we
want
the
cooperation
of
the
community
we
dont
want
the
community
to
be
afraid
to
report
crimes
to
us
because
of
immigration
status
