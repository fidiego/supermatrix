the
patriot
ledger
a
robert
casimiro
spends
much
of
his
time
going
where
he
and
his
small
band
of
antiimmigration
activists
are
not
wanted
recently
the
retired
engineer
from
weymouth
showed
up
with
one
ally
at
a
suffolk
university
law
school
forum
dominated
by
the
enemy
immigration
advocates
were
always
outnumbered
wherever
we
go
he
said
casimiro
66
is
executive
director
of
the
massachusetts
coalition
for
immigration
reform
virtually
the
only
organized
voice
in
massachusetts
for
immigration
restrictions
the
small
but
vocal
group
has
grown
to
about
130
members
since
lorrie
hall
of
duxbury
helped
create
it
in
1998
casimiro
and
hall
said
like
most
mainstream
organizations
that
favor
limiting
immigration
the
coalition
argues
that
immigrants
cause
sprawl
and
environmental
problems
by
increasing
the
population
bring
third
world
diseases
to
the
united
states
and
take
jobs
and
depress
wages
of
american
workers
members
want
the
government
to
cut
back
legal
entrants
to
about
300000
people
a
year
from
the
current
1
million
and
eliminate
illegal
immigration
the
united
states
is
the
fastestgrowing
country
in
the
world
because
of
immigrants
hall
said
cutting
immigration
by
70
percent
might
well
have
closed
the
door
to
armelino
marchesini
a
38yearold
baker
from
quincy
who
became
a
us
citizen
on
wednesday
he
arrived
10
years

from

if
someone
comes
from
a
country
where
the
economic
opportunity
isnt
there
to
meet
your
basic
human
needs
thats
what
this
country
is
all
about
said
his

who
watched
proudly
from
the
balcony
of
the
hynes
veterans
memorial
convention
center
in
boston
as
her
husband
and
1433
others
took

these
are
good
hardworking
people
who
dont
get
in
trouble
as
a
rule
theyre
not
a
threat
to
the
average
american
massachusetts
ranks
high
among
the
preferred
destinations
for
immigrants
to
the
united
states
the
state
has
added
an
average
of
23000
new
foreignborn
residents
every
year
since
1988
the
seventh
highest
total
in
the
nation
overall
the
states
immigration
rate
has
increased
9
percent
since
1999
slightly
under
the
national
average
although
casimiros
coalition
focuses
primarily
on
legal
immigration
illegal
immigration
remains
the
hotbutton
issue
nationally
last
month
voters
in
arizona
passed
a
ballot
measure
to
keep
illegal
immigrants
from
obtaining
some
government
services
and
groups
in
georgia
idaho
california
and
colorado
are
considering
similar
proposals
called
proposition
200
the
controversial
arizona
law
is
intended
to
prevent
illegal
immigrants
from
obtaining
food
stamps
welfare
and
other
social
services
it
requires
proof
of
immigration
status
to
obtain
certain
government
services
ali
noorani
director
of
the
massachusetts
refugee
and
immigrant
advocacy
coalition
has
heard
the
arguments
for
restricting
immigration
many
times
he
counters
that
immigrants
dont
contribute
to
sprawl
and
pollution
because
most
of
them
settle
in
environmentally
efficient
cities
instead
of
suburbs
that
any
international
traveler
can
bring
back
disease
and
that
lifting
immigration
restrictions
will
improve
conditions
for
all
workers
by
preventing
exploitation
of
illegal
aliens
of
casimiros
coalition
he
says
this
is
a
group
that
is
trying
to
incite
the
politics
of
fear
lorrie
hall
and
casimiro
traveled
different
paths
to
their
activism
casimiro
was
galvanized
by
the
terrorist
attacks
on
sept
11
2001
he
said
like
a
lot
of
americans
when
that
happened
i
was
personally
wounded
he
said
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
research
into
immigration
policies
he
joined
the
coalition
he
said
as
for
the
immigrant
heritage
that
he
shares
with
most
americans
casimiro
said
the
situation
was
different
when
his
grandparents
came
to
this
country
in
1905
from
the
azores
the
portugueseowned
islands
off
west
africa
they
came
here
legally
and
immigration
levels
were
not
so
high
he
said
hall
who
moved
to
duxbury
from
reading
in
1997
was
interested
in
reducing
immigration
for
a
long
time
because
i
was
concerned
about
sprawl
she
said
hall
is
a
member
of
the
sierra
club
the
national
environmental
group
that
split
sharply
over
immigration
policy
and
its
effect
on
the
environment
after
members
voted
in
1998
not
to
support
immigration
restrictions
as
part
of
population
control
some
continue
to
lobby
for
the
cause
although
hall
said
she
didnt
form
the
coalition
in
response
to
the
sierra
club
turmoil
environmental
issues
drive
her
concern
over
immigration
she
said
in
duxbury
i
see
every
lot
and
farm
being
carved
up
hall
said
its
the
population
push
thats
doing
it
although
most
americans
have
ancestors
who
were
foreignborn
antiimmigration
causes
have
attracted
supporters
since
the
1700s
historians
say
hall
and
casimiro
say
their
opposition
to
immigration
is
not
based
on
race
and
say
they
dont
have
any
quarrel
with
individual
immigrants
it
upsets
me
when
people
refer
to
us
as
antiimmigrant
casimiro
said
said
hall
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
racism
it
has
to
do
with
common
sense
yet
casimiro
talks
of
illegal
mexican
immigrants
whose
culture
is
antithetical
to
the
american
culture
they
have
one
party
that
ruled
for
years
he
said
theyre
not
getting
anything
through
their
government
so
they
have
to
disobey
the
law
its
understandable
in
mexico
but
we
dont
want
that
type
of
thing
here
noorani
the
immigration
advocate
said
he
and
opponents
like
hall
and
casimiro
can
agree
on
one
thing
when
i
talk
to
them
we
both
agree
that
the
immigration
system
is
broken
he
said
they
are
always
asking
why
so
many
illegal
immigrants
are
coming
in
i
would
say
its
broken
because
its
unfair
and
doesnt
allow
legal
immigration
both
sides
also
seem
to
agree
on
another
issue
the
limited
success
of
the
massachusetts
coalition
for
immigration
reform
in
making
progress
toward
its
goals
we
dont
have
a
lot
of
influence
because
the
advocates
have
been
at
it
for
a
long
time
casimiro
said
our
only
voice
generally
goes
through
talk
radio
noorani
said
members
of
the
antiimmigrant
coalition
try
to
get
their
views
heard
by
following
us
around
theyre
not
tapping
into
a
more
widespread
view
he
said
i
would
not
quibble
with
the
fact
that
nationally
there
is
an
antiimmigrant
sentiment
but
in
massachusetts
we
are
trying
to
stem
