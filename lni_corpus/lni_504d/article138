rep
phil
gingrey
wants
georgians
to
know
that
even
a
trickle
of
immigration
can
lead
to
a
deluge
the
marietta
republican
explained
just
how
bad
he
thinks
it
can
get
during
a
state
legislative
committee
meeting
on
immigration
speaking
via
a
video
conference
transmission
from
washington
on
dec
16
he
put
blame
on
the
shoulders
of
national
immigration
policy
and
so
now
under
the
policy
our
immigration
policy
literally
one
person
with
a
green
card
can
bring
in
in
the
extreme
279
people
that
sounds
like
a
lot
is
this
true
immigration
became
a
central
issue
during
the
election
season
when
nowgov
nathan
deal
and
his
democratic
foe
former
gov
roy
barnes
both
called
for
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
that
states
decision
to
take
a
more
active
role
enforcing
federal
laws
prompted
the
us
department
of
justice
to
file
suit
against
it
we
called
gingreys
office
for
evidence
a
staffer
referred
us
to
numbersusa
a
nonprofit
group
that
advocates
for
lower
immigration
levels
roy
beck
the
groups
executive
director
said
he
did
not
know
of
any
cases
where
this
happened
but
he
emphasized
its
possible
through
chain
migration
thats
when
immigrants
take
advantage
of
us
rules
that
allow
them
to
bring
their
relatives
here
foreigners
who
obtain
green
cards
can
apply
to
the
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
to
bring
their
spouses
and
unmarried
children
if
they
become
citizens
and
are
over
age
21
they
can
also
apply
to
bring
in
their
married
children
parents
and
siblings
we
checked
numbersusas
math
the
group
used
immigration
rules
and
fertility
rates
for
lessdeveloped
countries
to
determine
that
273
relatives
of
a
legal
immigrant
can
follow
him
during
the
next
15
years
gingrey
said
279
but
we
wont
count
this
slight
difference
against
him
because
gingrey
said
such
immigration
was
possible
in
the
extreme
we
accepted
the
groups
assumptions
such
as
that
in
recent
years
families
in
the
lessdeveloped
world
have
on
average
three
children
and
that
all
of
an
immigrants
eligible
family
members
would
leave
for
the
us
and
become
citizens
as
soon
as
they
could
legally
do
so
we
also
assumed
there
were
absolutely
no
visa
processing
waits
and
that
immigration
backlogs
do
not
exist
we
found
numbersusas
estimate
was
not
based
on
literally
one
person
with
a
green
card
entering
the
country
as
gingrey
said
their
estimate
assumes
that
the
first
immigrant
comes
here
as
a
worker
with
his
spouse
and
three
children
this
roughly
doubles
its
estimate
we
also
found
that
immigration
researchers
generally
agree
that
in
the
real
world
such
largescale
immigration
is
at
least
extremely
unlikely
if
not
impossible
jessica
vaughan
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
advocates
for
lower
immigration
levels
is
critical
of
chain
migration
but
she
noted
that
administrative
wait
times
and
quotas
can
make
such
largescale
migration
difficult
she
had
not
heard
of
a
case
where
this
has
happened
karen
woodrowlafield
who
studies
immigration
as
a
professor
at
the
maryland
population
research
center
at
the
university
of
maryland
noted
those
same
problems
she
said
such
numbers
are
not
possible
under
the
current
immigration
system
because
of
visa
application
backlogs
atlantas
uscis
field
office
now
takes
four
or
five
months
to
process
immigration
documents
in
california
the
processing
time
for
us
citizens
to
bring
in
siblings
is
more
than
four
years
crystal
williams
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
a
national
association
of
attorneys
and
law
professors
who
practice
and
teach
immigration
law
said
her
group
also
determined
that
numbersusas
figures
are
not
possible
her
group
supports
the
us
justice
departments
suit
against
arizona
if
people
could
bring
in
those
numbers
they
would
have
williams
said
but
they
didnt
us
law
sets
yearly
quotas
on
legal
permanent
residents
and
caps
the
percentage
of
potential
immigrants
from
a
particular
country
to
7
percent
this
means
waits
that
can
last
for
decades
for
instance
filipino
siblings
of
us
residents
who
applied
for
visas
before
jan
1
1988
are
only
just
beginning
to
be
interviewed
for
entry
according
to
the
us
state
department
for
countries
without
backlogs
the
date
is
jan
1
2002
in
reality
chainmigration
numbers
are
much
lower
experts
who
study
chain
migration
told
us
over
a
span
of
20
years
immigrants
who
came
in
on
employment
visas
in
1971
brought
in
an
average
of
one
resident
more
recently
one
researcher
found
that
on
average
one
foreign
citizen
brings
in
21
others
under
family
reunification
rules
and
another
study
shows
only
some
10
percent
of
immigrants
who
got
their
green
cards
in
2003
petitioned
to
bring
a
relative
to
the
us
so
what
does
this
mean
gingrey
said
that
literally
one
person
with
a
green
card
could
bring
in
more
than
270
others
in
the
extreme
but
we
found
his
figure
was
not
based
on
one
person
its
based
on
a
family
of
five
we
found
this
scenario
is
likely
impossible
under
quotas
established
under
current
immigration
policy
quotas
mean
it
can
take
years
even
decades
merely
processing
immigration
documents
can
take
months
if
not
years
given
that
recent
data
show
that
the
average
immigrant
brings
in
21
others
in
his
lifetime
gingrey
could
easily
have
remained
within
the
bounds
of
accuracy
by
describing
an
extreme
scenario
as
one
where
two
or
three
dozen
others
followed
the
first
immigrant
within
15
years
instead
he
said
279
hundreds
more
than
extreme
we
therefore
rule
gingreys
statement
false
