the
new
chairman
of
the
us
senate
immigration
subcommittee
promised
tuesday
to
resist
new
limits
on
legal
immigration
that
would
hurt
silicon
valley
industries
even
as
noisy
protesters
were
deriding
him
as
the
poster
boy
of
mass
immigration
arguing
that
congress
must
note
the
positive
contributions
made
by
legal
immigrants
sen
spencer
abraham
rmich
contended
that
lawmakers
have
already
eliminated
most
of
the
excesses
of
immigration
by
cracking
down
on
illegal
entry
into
the
country
abraham
said
hell
try
to
keep
his
fellow
lawmakers
from
extending
that
gettough
attitude
to
legal
immigration
abraham
made
his
comments
at
the
north
san
jose
headquarters
of
cypress
semiconductor
corp
whose
president
and
chief
executive
officer
tj
rodgers
joined
abraham
in
fighting
to
strip
restrictions
on
legal
immigration
from
last
years
bill
flanked
tuesday
by
executives
of
three
dozen
companies
from
sun
microsystems
to
netscape
to
cisco
systems
rodgers
called
abraham
a
hero
of
freedom
the
antiimmigration
demonstrators
had
a
different
viewpoint
hoisting
signs
such
as
senator
abraham
loves
illegals
and
stop
bashing
us
citizens
more
than
100
protesters
marched
in
a
circle
outside
the
news
conference
other
chanters
took
pot
shots
at
the
cypress
ceo
send
tj
to
tj
tijuana
and
we
dont
need
mr
rodgers
in
our
neighborhood
they
yelled
despite
the
humor
and
theatrics
the
media
circus
highlighted
a
deadly
serious
issue
for
hightech
executives
many
of
whom
contend
that
legal
immigration
is
their
lifeblood
under
current
immigration
quotas
the
united
states
now
legally
admits
some
800000
people
annually
but
after
a
1995
bipartisan
commission
led
by
the
late
barbara
jordan
recommended
significant
cuts
in
immigration
quotas
and
president
clinton
responded
favor
ably
congress
incorporated
reductions
of
about
a
third
into
the
immigration
bill
pressure
from
hightech
businesses
and
other
immigration
advocates
eventually
led
congress
to
eliminate
the
quota
reductions
from
the
bill
abraham
allied
with
jack
kemp
william
bennett
and
other
proimmigration
republicans
played
a
key
part
in
that
process
abraham
was
appointed
to
his
new
post
monday
by
sen
orrin
hatch
rutah
another
proimmigration
lawmaker
who
heads
the
senate
judiciary
committee
he
replaces
retiring
wyoming
republican
alan
simpson
the
senates
leading
expert
on
immigration
who
favored
greater
restrictions
congressional
observers
see
abrahams
appointment
as
a
sign
that
anti
immigration
forces
despite
public
opinion
polls
that
show
americans
siding
with
them
have
a
tough
fight
ahead
its
going
to
be
much
much
more
difficult
to
enact
reforms
if
that
wing
of
the
republican
party
dominates
said
ira
mehlman
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
who
came
up
from
los
angeles
for
the
demonstration
its
going
to
result
in
a
stalemate
abraham
and
rodgers
said
tuesday
that
its
a
myth
that
immigration
results
in
fewer
jobs
for
americans
rodgers
said
that
although
corporate
downsizing
has
made
many
americans
fearful
of
losing
their
jobs
hightech
businesses
cant
find
all
the
skilled
people
they
need
to
expand
legal
immigration
is
part
of
his
solution
he
said
that
a
disproportionate
amount
of
researchanddevelopment
jobs
at
cypress
about
40
percent
are
held
by
immigrants
and
because
each
rd
job
creates
nine
additional
jobs
he
said
eliminating
the
immigrants
would
result
in
a
loss
of
720
jobs
at
cypress
most
of
which
are
held
by
nativeborn
americans
rodgers
also
noted
that
four
out
of
10
of
his
senior
vice
presidents
are
foreignborn
as
are
two
of
cypress
four
outside
directors
as
he
introduced
the
vps
he
took
the
opportunity
to
mock
former
gop
presidential
candidate
pat
buchanan
by
introducing
his
jose
buchanans
derisive
euphemism
for
immigrants
jose
arreola
a
mexican
immigrant
with
a
doctorate
in
transistor
physics
is
cypress
top
scientist
rodgers
noted
but
perry
lorenz
of
immigration
control
advocates
of
northern
california
contended
that
rodgers
has
tirelessly
campaigned
to
block
immigration
reform
so
his
industry
can
have
a
large
international
pool
of
lowwage
workers
to
pick
and
choose
