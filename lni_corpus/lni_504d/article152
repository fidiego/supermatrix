for
a
state
that
has
been
largely
absent
from
the
public
debate
over
immigration
missouris
places
politicians
and
professors
have
been
surprisingly
involved
in
a
variety
of
ways
valley
park
john
ashcroft
and
university
of
missourikansas
city
professor
kris
kobach
have
all
helped
shape
the
current
push
among
states
and
municipalities
around
the
country
to
get
tough
on
immigration
enforcement
the
new
environment
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
sept
11
2001
caused
immigration
which
until
then
had
been
debated
largely
on
economic
grounds
to
be
viewed
as
well
through
the
prism
of
national
security
that
put
a
damper
on
what
had
been
a
strong
push
to
reform
the
nations
immigration
system
ashcroft
missouris
former
governor
and
senator
was
serving
in
2001
as
attorney
general
the
nations
top
law
enforcement
official
in
that
capacity
he
reversed
the
opinions
of
his
six
immediate
predecessors
by
telling
local
police
they
could
enforce
immigration
laws
this
helped
spread
the
immigration
flow
away
from
the
six
states
that
had
previously
received
the
overwhelming
share
and
to
urban
areas
where
sentiment
over
immigration
was
less
polarized
and
rural
areas
with
poultry
or
meatpacking
plants
immigrants
felt
they
might
be
less
subject
to
scrutiny
in
these
quieter
places
that
in
turn
began
to
arouse
political
reaction
in
places
unused
to
this
phenomenon
including
small
municipalities
and
rural
areas
of
missouri
as
the
immigration
issue
grew
increasingly
controversial
legislators
in
washington
couldnt
agree
whether
to
broadly
reform
policy
or
simply
get
tough
on
illegal
immigration
and
close
the
borders
the
resulting
inaction
led
to
frustration
among
some
state
and
local
authorities
who
decided
to
take
their
own
steps
hazleton
a
town
in
pennsylvania
acted
first
followed
by
st
louis
countys
valley
park
whose
illegal
immigration
relief
act
ordinance
of
2006
targeted
employers
who
hired
or
landlords
who
rented
to
illegal
immigrants
the
missouri
case
assumed
prime
importance
when
hazletons
measure
was
struck
down
by
the
courts
shining
the
national
legal
spotlight
on
valley
park
and
the
subsequent
upholding
of
parts
of
the
local
ordinance
was
a
pivotal
moment
in
the
immigration
controversy
it
sparked
political
infighting
among
leaders
in
valley
park
led
to
some
dramatic
events
including
immigrants
taking
refuge
in
a
church
spawned
tougher
enforcement
by
some
surrounding
communities
and
gave
rise
to
a
variety
of
legal
actions
on
a
national
level
it
encouraged
similar
action
by
other
communities
helping
inspire
in
2007
alone
the
introduction
in
state
legislatures
of
1100
immigration
bills
many
of
them
restrictive
in
nature
and
multitudes
of
local
ordinances
many
immigration
measures
including
in
hazleton
valley
park
and
arizona
were
written
by
umkcs
kobach
who
had
been
a
top
aide
in
washington
to
ashcroft
on
immigration
matters
there
is
a
wellorganized
wellfunded
effort
to
help
states
craft
and
defend
immigration
measures
the
movement
is
really
being
spearheaded
by
kris
kobach
says
richard
middleton
an
immigration
lawyer
in
st
louis
associate
professor
of
political
science
at
the
university
of
missourist
louis
and
adjunct
law
professor
at
st
louis
university
after
ashcroft
left
office
kobach
signed
on
to
teach
constitutional
law
at
umkc
and
from
that
perch
he
has
become
the
intellectual
father
of
much
of
the
nationwide
antiimmigration
fervor
in
recent
years
helping
write
legislation
and
ordinances
from
arizona
to
cherokee
county
in
georgia
john
ammann
a
st
louis
university
law
professor
who
led
a
legal
fight
against
the
valley
park
ordinance
says
kobach
is
traveling
around
the
country
enticing
communities
to
express
antiimmigrant
sentiment
stirring
reasonable
people
into
a
frenzy
tell
me
the
borders
of
valley
park
are
safer
now
than
before
the
litigation
there
wasnt
a
problem
to
begin
