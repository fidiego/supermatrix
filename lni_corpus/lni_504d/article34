i
am
an
evangelical
christian
and
i
am
politically
conservative
for
some
time
i
have
supported
immigration
reform
i
work
with
a
broad
coalition
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
laws
including
the
evangelical
immigration
table
i
believe
that
immigration
reform
represents
an
opportunity
for
me
to
live
out
my
values
and
an
opportunity
for
a
victory
of
conservative
values
in
public
life
the
importance
of
immigration
reform
is
a
quickly
growing
consensus
among
my
peers
but
i
am
on
a
mission
to
persuade
the
remaining
skeptics
consistent
with
orthodox
christian
teaching
that
finds
its
roots
in
the
first
chapters
of
the
book
of
genesis
evangelicals
believe
that
men
and
women
are
created
in
the
image
of
god
and
worthy
of
dignity
and
respect
we
believe
the
bible
is
clear
in
its
call
for
us
to
treat
all
people
with
respect
and
to
care
for
our
neighbors
including
those
who
are
the
strangers
in
our
midst
the
bible
admonishes
the
israelite
people
to
treat
the
stranger
alien
or
foreigner
with
kindness
because
they
were
once
strangers
in
a
foreign
land
jesus
says
that
we
should
treat
the
stranger
as
we
would
treat
jesus
himself
immigration
is
about
how
we
treat
the
stranger
advocating
for
immigration
reform
that
secures
our
borders
enforces
our
laws
and
respects
family
unity
and
human
dignity
is
consistent
with
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
teachings
of
jesus
these
are
the
three
legs
of
immigration
reform
while
some
may
disagree
with
scriptural
mandate
to
care
for
those
around
us
including
our
immigrant
neighbors
there
is
no
disputing
our
history
as
a
nation
of
immigrants
the
first
people
to
come
to
the
new
world
sought
religious
freedom
and
economic
opportunity
in
places
such
as
plymouth
mass
and
jamestown
va
these
men
and
women
were
not
unlike
those
who
come
to
our
shores
today
a
majority
of
whom
are
fleeing
religious
persecution
or
simply
looking
for
a
better
life
and
economic
opportunity
as
americans
we
want
our
immigration
laws
to
be
just
fair
workable
and
compassionate
for
all
the
american
economy
benefits
greatly
from
immigrants
on
all
levels
from
lowerskilled
agriculture
work
to
the
highskilled
technology
sectors
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
the
proposed
fixes
to
our
immigration
laws
not
only
would
grow
the
economy
and
labor
pool
creating
new
wealth
but
also
would
decrease
the
federal
deficit
many
bipartisan
policy
studies
and
think
tanks
point
to
immigrants
as
a
vital
part
to
our
economy
not
only
as
laborers
and
workers
but
as
consumers
and
taxpayers
economic
and
moral
arguments
aside
one
thing
we
can
all
agree
upon
is
that
our
immigration
laws
are
broken
we
need
to
secure
the
border
this
is
a
matter
of
national
security
we
need
to
enforce
our
laws
for
too
long
the
laws
have
been
ignored
we
must
streamline
the
process
of
legal
immigration
and
reduce
the
bureaucracy
we
must
also
deal
justly
with
the
undocumented
immigrants
who
are
living
in
our
midst
we
should
deport
those
who
have
committed
violent
crimes
we
should
give
the
rest
a
choice
to
obtain
some
form
of
legal
status
this
choice
should
include
a
penalty
there
should
be
no
special
treatment
they
should
go
to
the
back
of
the
line
and
begin
the
process
to
become
legal
they
should
learn
english
and
learn
about
america
like
anyone
who
goes
through
the
immigration
process
detractors
within
the
conservative
evangelical
community
are
few
but
vocal
their
arguments
and
positions
fail
to
deal
with
the
reality
of
our
21stcentury
economy
and
the
needs
of
a
growing
and
changing
nation
ultimately
these
groups
lack
of
vision
has
helped
contribute
to
the
current
political
stalemate
which
only
perpetuates
the
status
quo
a
broken
system
that
does
not
address
the
needs
of
the
marketplace
does
not
value
secure
borders
and
is
hurting
the
hardworking
families
in
our
communities
the
immigration
issue
is
about
more
than
immigration
it
is
about
the
soul
of
america
it
is
about
the
american
dream
that
grew
out
of
our
roots
as
people
seeking
religious
freedom
and
economic
opportunity
it
is
about
the
reason
america
was
founded
it
is
about
the
conservative
principles
of
marketdriven
economic
opportunities
secure
workable
borders
and
a
place
for
the
persecuted
and
downtrodden
to
come
to
i
still
believe
in
that
dream
and
i
believe
we
should
welcome
those
who
share
it
