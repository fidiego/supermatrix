a
republican
from
dumas
said
he
didnt
plan
to
promote
287g
agreements
local
governments
he
said
should
decide
whether
they
want
to
take
on
the
immigration
issue
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
ensure
that
officers
get
appropriate
training
before
they
try

laws
some
local
police
and
city
leaders
he
said
have
been
enforcing
immigration
laws
without

out
there

police
chief
richard
wiles
said
having
local
officers
enforce
immigration
laws
is
a
bad
idea
for
several
reasons
its
a
federal
responsibility
wiles
said
its
their
job
we
dont
have
the
resources
to
do
it
and
the
taxpayers
of
el
paso
should
not
have
to
pay
to
have
their
police
department
doing
the
federal
governments
job
