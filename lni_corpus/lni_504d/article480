in
a
setback
to
those
who
want
to
cut
legal
immigration
the
senate
judiciary
committee
appears
ready
to
consider
new
restrictions
on
legal
and
illegal
aliens
in
two
separate
bills
with
illegal
immigration
to
be
considered
first
rather
than
one
overall
measure
if
the
committee
approves
this
approach
on
thursday
which
its
opponents
conceded
today
was
likely
congress
would
probably
have
time
in
its
compressed
electionyear
schedule
to
focus
on
illegal
aliens
and
make
few
if
any
major
changes
in
laws
governing
legal
immigration
passage
of
an
amendment
dividing
the
immigration
bill
into
two
parts
this
way
would
be
a
victory
for
an
odd
coalition
of
libertarians
religious
organizations
proimmigration
groups
and
business
leaders
who
oppose
restrictions
on
the
entry
of
skilled
foreign
workers
and
the
elimination
of
categories
of
relatives
that
american
citizens
can
sponsor
to
live
here
supporters
of
legal
immigration
contend
that
the
law
now
insures
that
american
companies
can
remain
competitive
in
the
global
market
and
helps
to
unify
extended
families
in
the
tradition
of
this
nation
of
immigrants
senator
alan
k
simpson
a
wyoming
republican
who
is
the
main
author
of
the
legislation
and
who
is
seeking
to
reduce
legal
immigration
acknowledged
at
a
hearing
today
that
he
had
exhausted
all
personal
pleas
and
tactical
ploys
in
an
effort
to
delay
the
amendment
he
did
not
have
the
votes
to
defeat
i
can
count
the
votes
as
well
as
anyone
he
said
mr
simpson
and
his
allies
who
are
seeking
to
cut
legal
immigration
by
about
20
percent
from
its
current
annual
level
of
775000
could
always
try
to
recombine
the
two
bills
or
add
amendments
when
the
full
senate
considers
the
legislation
in
april
but
those
approaches
are
filled
with
risks
and
uncertainty
with
congress
operating
on
the
tightened
schedule
proimmigration
groups
said
splitting
the
immigration
bill
would
probably
force
proponents
of
deep
cuts
in
legal
immigration
to
abandon
their
efforts
or
make
enough
concessions
to
win
house
and
senate
approval
this
would
send
a
message
that
deep
cuts
in
legal
immigration
are
so
controversial
that
unless
they
are
tabled
until
next
year
or
minimized
considerably
the
whole
immigration
reform
issue
may
falter
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
proimmigration
group
in
washington
the
house
is
to
vote
next
week
on
its
immigration
bill
which
includes
provisions
on
legal
and
illegal
aliens
but
a
big
fight
is
brewing
over
whether
to
permit
an
amendment
on
the
house
floor
to
divide
that
bill
in
two
at
todays
hearing
in
the
senate
the
judiciary
committee
also
approved
by
voice
vote
an
amendment
by
senator
edward
m
kennedy
democrat
of
massachusetts
to
give
judges
broader
discretion
to
impose
stiffer
criminal
penalties
on
people
convicted
of
illegally
ferrying
undocumented
aliens
into
the
country
and
in
a
victory
for
smallbusiness
owners
the
committee
approved
an
amendment
by
senator
orrin
g
hatch
republican
of
utah
to
eliminate
provisions
in
the
legislation
to
increase
fines
levied
against
employers
who
knowingly
hire
illegal
aliens
the
vote
was
10
to
8
if
the
judiciary
committee
divides
the
bill
it
would
represent
a
remarkable
triumph
for
senator
spencer
abraham
a
michigan
republican
who
has
led
the
effort
to
divide
it
over
mr
simpson
the
senates
leading
voice
on
immigration
issues
and
a
skilled
legislative
tactician
mr
abraham
a
freshman
senator
whom
mr
simpson
outflanked
in
the
committees
first
meeting
to
consider
the
legislation
regrouped
and
fended
off
mr
simpsons
efforts
in
recent
days
to
peel
votes
from
his
side
although
mr
simpson
and
his
allies
have
said
a
vote
to
split
the
bill
represents
a
vote
to
kill
legal
immigration
reductions
mr
abraham
says
he
has
no
such
designs
under
mr
abrahams
amendment
the
committee
would
take
up
provisions
dealing
with
legal
immigration
within
seven
days
after
finishing
work
on
illegal
aliens
im
in
no
way
trying
to
kill
legal
immigration
reform
but
its
a
distinct
and
separate
topic
and
ought
to
be
dealt
with
that
way
mr
abraham
said
after
the
hearing
but
mr
abraham
added
that
addressing
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
separately
would
pressure
the
committee
to
put
together
a
legal
immigration
bill
that
enjoyed
broad
bipartisan
support
the
clinton
administration
is
a
wild
card
in
this
legislative
equation
the
white
house
last
year
endorsed
a
recommendation
by
a
federal
advisory
panel
to
cut
legal
immigration
by
a
third
but
recently
the
administration
has
focused
its
efforts
more
on
curbing
illegal
immigration
and
guaranteeing
protections
for
american
workers
the
administration
wants
a
bill
that
deals
with
legal
and
illegal
immigration
doris
meissner
the
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
said
on
tuesday
the
tactics
are
up
to
congress
