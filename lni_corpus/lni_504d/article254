an
undocumented
immigrant
whom
immigration
officers
nabbed
days
after
he
was
released
on
bond
from
the
tulsa
jail
will
face
deportation
proceedings
a
spokesman
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
said
that
will
come
only
after
the
man
javier
cortez
handles
expected
charges
from
an
arrest
june
2
in
tulsa
on
a
complaint
of
cocaine
possession
cortezs
case
revealed
several
problems
in
the
local
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
when
he
bonded
out
of
the
jail
where
deputies
are
supposed
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
prisoners
he
got
caught
between
two
different
shifts
said
chief
deputy
tim
albin
of
the
tulsa
county
sheriffs
office
thats
not
an
excuse
but
i
suspect
thats
what
happened
standing
in
the
stark
white
jail
albin
held
two
different
files
for
cortez
one
under
the
last
name
cortez
the
other
under
another
last
name
cortez
also
lists
two
different
dates
of
birth
this
is
part
of
the
problem
that
we
unscrew
on
a
daily
basis
said
albin
the
jail
supervisor
they
will
use
their
mothers
last
name
their
uncles
last
name
and
10
different
dates
of
birth
sometimes
its
just
a
nightmare
they
do
it
on
purpose
because
they
know
they
can
confuse
the
system
after
cortez
bonded
out
immigration
officials
verified
that
he
is
in
the
united
states
illegally
he
was
arrested
the
evening
of
june
5
at
the
office
of
his
bailbond
agent
said
tim
counts
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
spokesman
cortez
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
in
immigration
court
this
is
the
second
time
that
cortez
believed
to
be
18
or
19
was
booked
into
the
tulsa
jail
he
was
arrested
in
october
2006
on
a
misdemeanor
complaint
of
driving
under
the
influence
he
was
also
cited
on
that
stop
for
transporting
an
open
container
and
lacking
a
drivers
license
or
insurance
verification
immigration
officials
were
not
notified
of
the
first
arrest
counts
said
albin
said
the
jail
didnt
then
conduct
immigration
checks
on
those
arrested
in
misdemeanor
cases
albin
said
the
jails
current
policy
is
to
notify
immigration
officials
when
the
status
of
someone
booked
is
in
question
albin
said
federal
officials
can
place
a
detainer
that
prevents
a
person
from
bonding
out
until
his
or
her
status
of
residency
is
verified
jail
attendants
didnt
check
cortez
immigration
status
when
he
was
booked
early
june
3
albin
said
cortez
immigration
status
should
have
been
checked
when
cortez
listed
his
place
of
birth
as
mexico
but
it
wasnt
jailers
called
federal
officials
about
cortez
the
day
after
he
bonded
out
sheriffs
deputies
now
ask
for
the
birthplace
of
everyone
booked
into
the
jail
if
someone
is
born
outside
of
the
united
states
or
if
there
are
other
reasons
to
question
the
suspects
legality
such
as
an
inability
to
speak
english
or
lack
of
a
drivers
license
a
deputy
will
ask
immigration
officials
to
run
a
check
on
the
person
with
the
department
of
homeland
securitys
law
enforcement
support
center
albin
said
the
jails
booking
system
has
several
points
in
which
a
prisoner
regardless
of
race
or
ethnicity
is
questioned
about
immigration
status
its
predominantly
a
hispanic
issue
but
take
a
white
guy
like
me
he
said
if
i
come
in
the
jail
and
they
have
questions
about
my
legal
status
ill
go
through
the
same
process
as
anyone
else
given
probable
cause
of
unlawful
presence
federal
officials
can
order
the
person
detained
until
his
or
her
immigration
status
is
determined
although
immigration
officials
said
a
hold
can
be
placed
in
as
little
as
an
hour
it
doesnt
always
happen
so
quickly
albin
said
federal
officials
respond
within
12
to
24
hours
but
someone
can
bond
out
of
jail
in
as
little
as
four
hours
he
said
if
the
jail
hasnt
heard
from
immigration
officials
and
a
prisoner
legally
posts
bond
the
jail
has
no
right
not
to
release
that
person
albin
said
unlawful
presence
in
the
us
is
a
civil
offense
not
a
federal
crime
the
charge
is
addressed
in
immigration
court
an
administrative
establishment
where
the
gravest
punishment
is
deportation
sometimes
illegal
immigrants
bond
out
before
federal
officials
get
them
but
thats
happening
less
and
less
albin
said
federal
officials
are
generally
getting
back
to
the
jail
faster
which
means
more
people
are
being
held
on
detainers
he
added
immigration
officials
picked
up
five
persons
with
detainers
on
tuesday
and
six
more
on
monday

things
are
changing
the
tulsa
county
sheriffs
office
which
operates
the
tulsa
jail
is
working
on
an
agreement
with
the
federal
government
to
tackle
illegal
immigration
the
agreement
would
provide
training
for
30
of
the
offices
deputies
to
conduct
immigration
status
checks
instead
of
asking
federal
agents
to
do
it
chief
deputy
tim
albin
said
the
agreement
would
allow
deputies
to
more
efficiently
place
a
detainer
on
someone
whose
immigration
status
is
in
question
this
type
of
detainer
prevents
a
person
from
bonding
out
of
jail
before
the
status
is
determined
the
training
of
deputies
should
start
later
this
year
albin
said
the
states
sweeping
immigration
law
which
takes
effect
in
november
classifies
arrested
illegal
immigrants
as
flight
risks
which
changes
bond
policies
it
could
double
the
bond
amount
or
eliminate
it
altogether
albin
said
were
looking
for
some
clarity
from
the
court
on
that
issue
he
said
mayor
kathy
taylor
recently
announced
that
she
agreed
with
the
city
councils
recommendation
that
the
immigration
status
be
checked
on
all
persons
booked
into
the
jail
for
a
felony
or
