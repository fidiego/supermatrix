grand

now
that
the
us
supreme
court
has
struck
down
all
but
the
most
controversial
piece
of
arizona
s
2010
immigration
law
groups
and
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
are
claiming
victory
they
are
also
using
the
split
decision
to
call
for
congressional
reform
of
immigration
laws
the
ruling
affirmed
that
immigration
law
is
a
federal
responsibility
but
allowed
arizona
law
enforcement
officers
to
continue
the
show
me
your
papers
portion
of
the
law
law
enforcement
can
ask
for
proof
of
citizenship
from
those
they
have
stopped
for
another
violation
and
whom
they
suspect
might
be
undocumented
but
the
obama
administration
moved
quickly
after
the
ruling
to
deflate
that
remaining
provision
the
department
of
homeland
security
announced
it
had
pulled
back
on
a
program
known
as
287g
which
allows
the
federal
agents
to
deputize
local
officials
to
make
immigrationbased
arrests
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
rescinded
that
agreement
in
arizona
the
move
means
that
even
if
local
police
step
up
immigration
checks
theyll
have
to
rely
on
federal
officials
to
make
the
arrests
and
federal
officials
made
clear
that
ice
would
be
selective
in
responding
to
the
expected
rise
in
calls
from
arizona
and
other
police
agencies
about
immigration
status
the
supreme
court
struck
down
the
parts
of
sb
1070
that
made
it
a
crime
for
unauthorized
immigrants
to
not
carry
government
documentation
papers
and
to
allow
police
to
arrest
immigrants
without
a
warrant
if
there
was
probable
cause
they
committed
an
offense
that
would
make
them
deportable
also
gone
under
the
new
ruling
is
the
part
of
the
law
forbidding
those
not
permitted
to
work
in
the
united
states
to
apply
for
solicit
or
perform
work
this
ruling
upheld
the
idea
that
being
undocumented
in
itself
is
not
a
crime
its
a
civil
violation
that
is
good
said
alan
kaplan
with
the
colorado
immigrant
rights
coalition
sen
mark
udall
welcomed
the
courts
decision
while
calling
for
bipartisan
solutions
to
immigration
problems
the
supreme
courts
decision
to
strike
down
the
majority
of
the
arizona
law
underscores
that
it
is
the
federal
governments
responsibility
to
enforce
our
nations
immigration
laws
udall
said
we
cannot
fully
address
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
with
a
patchwork
of
different
laws
across
the
country
congress
needs
to
act
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
from
the
other
side
of
the
debate
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
stated
that
the
courts
decision
makes
it
clear
that
states
have
the
power
to
discourage
illegal
aliens
from
settling
in
their
jurisdictions
federation
president
dan
stein
said
the
supreme
court
has
provided
state
and
local
governments
with
clear
guidelines
of
what
they
can
do
to
discourage
illegal
immigration
and
assist
in
immigration
enforcement
it
is
now
up
to
them
to
choose
whether
to
protect
the
interests
of
illegal
aliens
or
the
interests
of
citizens
