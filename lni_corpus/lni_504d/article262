brad
henry
signed
a
set
of
sweeping
immigration
reforms
into
law
on
tuesday
even
as
he
questioned
the
new
laws
effectiveness
henrys
signature
of
house
bill
1804
means
some
businesses
will
have
to
change
their
hiring
practices
when
the
law
takes
full
effect
in
july
2008
while
some
will
undoubtedly
claim
this
state
legislation
is
a
landmark
step
forward
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
we
will
not
effectively
address
immigration
reform
until
the
federal
government
acts
henry
said
in
a
statement
announcing
his
approval
of
house
bill
1804
also
called
the
oklahoma
taxpayer
and
citizen
protection
act
of
2007
illegal
immigration
is
a
very
serious
national
security
issue
that
must
be
addressed
at
the
federal
level
henry
said
states
can
take
some
actions
on
their
own
but
until
the
us
congress
enacts
a
comprehensive
national
immigration
policy
citizens
will
see
little
progress
on
this
issue
hb
1804
requires
businesses
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
their
new
hires
and
the
work
eligibility
of
independent
contractors
implementation
of
the
provisions
concerning
private
businesses
was
delayed
until
next
year
to
allow
time
to
observe
how
provisions
of
a
similar
law
recently
passed
in
georgia
will
work
out
oklahomas
state
agencies
will
have
to
follow
the
same
rules
for
checking
new
hires
work
eligibility
and
immigration
status
effective
nov
1
the
new
law
also
allows
a
us
citizen
who
has
been
fired
to
pursue
a
discrimination
claim
against
the
employer
if
an
illegal
alien
is
employed
to
do
the
same
job
hb
1804
requires
state
agencies
to
check
immigration
status
of
those
applying
for
public
benefits
new
restrictions
will
make
it
harder
for
illegal
immigrants
to
obtain
stateissued
drivers
licenses
and
identification
cards
local
law
enforcement
will
be
able
to
enforce
federal
immigration
law
and
verify
immigration
status
on
inmates
hb
1804s
author
state
rep
randy
terrill
rmoore
said
the
bill
has
been
recognized
as
the
nations
toughest
antiillegal
immigration
law
by
the
washington
dcbased
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
and
can
be
considered
a
model
for
other
states
to
follow
yet
hb
1804
bill
is
somewhat
less
stringent
than
legislation
terrill
introduced
last
year
which
included
severe
sanctions
against
employers
who
hire
illegal
immigrants
terrill
later
found
that
such
sanctions
are
preempted
by
federal
law
though
his
attempts
to
pass
an
antiillegal
immigration
bill
were
thwarted
last
year
when
the
bill
reached
the
democratcontrolled
senate
this
years
measure
sailed
through
the
state
senate
and
house
of
representatives
with
bipartisan
support
this
is
not
a
partisan
issue
said
terrill
illegal
immigration
is
a
growing
concern
among
both
democrat
and
republican
voters
he
said
and
those
voters
made
their
voices
heard
at
the
capitol
its
quite
refreshing
to
know
a
wellinformed
and
involved
citizenry
can
in
fact
make
a
difference
by
making
their
views
known
and
im
pleased
the
governor
received
that
message
and
chose
to
respect
the
will
of
the
people
terrill
said
but
henry
was
guarded
in
his
approval
of
hb
1804
on
tuesday
state
leaders
should
closely
monitor
the
impact
of
hb
1804
in
the
months
and
years
to
come
to
ensure
that
it
doesnt
have
any
unintended
consequences
