when
ruben
montemayor
a
lawyer
in
san
antonio
considers
the
nations
new
immigration
law
he
does
not
see
an
open
door
to
legal
status
for
aliens
eligible
for
amnesty
instead
he
sees
what
most
of
his
clients
do
a
tantalizing
quest
full
of
great
risks
demands
and
rewards
the
immigration
service
has
never
been
santa
claus
and
it
never
will
be
said
mr
montemayor
who
has
practiced
immigration
law
since
1969
in
san
antonio
and
before
that
spent
seven
years
as
a
lawyer
with
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
this
is
not
come
in
and
get
your
visa
mr
montemayor
continued
people
are
going
to
have
to
prove
their
case
and
i
mean
by
documented
evidence
and
if
they
cant
they
will
be
out
of
here
a
lot
of
people
are
offering
advice
right
now
who
dont
know
anything
about
immigration
law
and
they
are
going
to
do
people
are
lot
more
harm
than
good
many
being
victimized
mr
montemayors
skepticism
reflects
the
widespread
legal
and
personal
uncertainties
since
the
passage
of
the
law
which
is
taxing
the
resources
of
the
immigration
bar
and
demanding
painful
choices
from
illegal
aliens
willing
to
apply
for
amnesty
already
many
aliens
have
been
victimized
by
unscrupulous
or
untrained
legal
advisors
who
charge
stiff
fees
for
legal
aid
they
cannot
deliver
according
to
groups
that
work
with
aliens
others
are
desperately
trying
to
document
their
residence
after
years
of
trying
to
live
invisibly
and
all
are
weighing
the
advantages
of
legal
status
against
the
risks
of
revealing
themselves
for
the
first
time
to
a
judicial
system
that
in
the
past
has
been
responsible
for
deporting
them
immigration
officials
say
enforcement
agents
will
not
have
access
to
rejected
applications
for
amnesty
but
many
aliens
and
some
of
their
lawyers
doubt
it
some
lawyers
say
aliens
unlikely
to
make
it
through
the
system
safely
either
because
of
residency
problems
or
an
inability
to
show
proficiency
in
english
should
not
take
the
risk
key
part
effective
in
may
if
they
arent
going
to
be
able
to
pass
the
exam
i
wont
take
their
cases
said
ralph
garcia
an
el
paso
immigration
lawyer
otherwise
im
just
going
to
be
reporting
them
to
immigration
the
most
publicized
part
of
the
new
law
the
offer
of
amnesty
to
illegal
aliens
who
entered
the
united
states
before
jan
1
1982
and
have
been
here
continuously
since
then
does
not
go
into
effect
until
may
5
and
the
regulations
specifying
the
documentation
required
are
not
expected
until
later
this
month
the
immigration
service
will
later
open
100
offices
around
the
country
to
accept
applications
many
illegal
aliens
wary
of
getting
enmeshed
in
a
system
they
have
tried
to
evade
all
their
lives
are
not
going
to
apply
for
amnesty
no
matter
what
their
chances
lawyers
and
immigration
officials
say
some
think
there
will
be
far
fewer
applications
for
amnesty
than
expected
estimates
on
aliens
vary
alan
c
nelson
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
said
last
week
that
his
agency
estimated
as
many
39
million
illegal
aliens
might
apply
for
amnesty
under
the
new
law
officials
say
that
estimate
could
be
high
adding
that
there
was
no
way
to
reach
a
reliable
estimate
the
census
bureau
estimates
3
million
to
5
million
illegal
aliens
live
in
the
united
states
not
all
of
them
would
be
eligible
under
the
amnesty
program
the
immigration
service
estimates
there
are
65
million
to
7
millon
illegal
aliens
in
the
country
employers
unsure
of
their
responsibilities
under
the
new
law
aggrieved
workers
who
believe
they
have
been
illegally
dismissed
since
the
laws
passage
and
aliens
curious
about
the
options
are
already
flocking
to
lawyers
legal
clinics
and
social
service
centers
around
the
country
but
it
is
not
just
immigration
lawyers
who
are
offering
advice
in
cities
all
over
aliens
are
paying
stiff
fees
to
notaries
public
to
prepare
forms
for
them
in
central
america
notaries
are
local
officials
of
great
influence
and
administrative
power
in
the
united
states
they
generally
do
little
more
than
verify
signatures
for
a
minimal
fee
or
none
immigration
experts
say
illegal
aliens
are
paying
fees
ranging
from
100
to
more
than
1000
to
notaries
thinking
they
are
dealing
with
influential
lawyers
able
to
aid
their
case
they
get
50
calls
a
day
its
been
crazy
said
cheryl
little
a
lawyer
with
the
haitian
refugee
center
in
miami
she
said
two
lawyers
and
two
paralegal
workers
were
answering
calls
from
50
haitians
a
day
including
some
who
had
paid
fees
to
notaries
the
notaries
are
taking
their
money
and
theyre
not
completing
the
forms
we
have
so
many
questions
about
whats
going
on
but
notaries
have
no
monopoly
on
worthless
information
lawyers
in
orange
county
in
california
say
packets
of
bogus
documents
such
as
rent
receipts
and
bills
are
being
sold
on
the
streets
for
100
the
situation
is
particularly
troublesome
on
the
border
with
mexico
where
mexican
lawyers
are
advertising
their
services
to
mexicans
who
work
regularly
on
the
american
side
of
the
river
but
officials
say
it
is
a
problem
in
almost
any
metropolitan
area
with
a
large
population
of
illegal
aliens
the
immigrant
grapevine
is
pretty
quick
here
said
the
rev
peter
zendzian
director
of
the
northeast
regional
immigration
office
for
the
united
states
catholic
conference
migration
refugee
service
in
new
york
all
you
need
is
one
person
to
say
hey
this
guy
can
help
and
hes
in
business
these
people
have
been
afraid
for
a
long
time
theyve
been
looking
for
a
long
time
to
get
themselves
straightened
out
so
theyll
gladly
pay
the
going
rate
for
what
they
think
is
the
inside
track
but
there
is
no
inside
track
theres
not
even
a
track
yet
not
until
they
write
the
regulations
rise
in
interest
in
area
the
new
law
is
accelerating
interest
in
immigration
law
which
has
largely
been
viewed
as
a
highvolume
lowglamour
section
of
the
legal
profession
membership
in
the
40yearold
american
immigration
lawyers
association
has
increased
from
1000
members
in
may
1979
to
2100
members
now
in
california
the
immigration
bar
has
virtually
quadrupled
since
1980
in
1980
there
were
112
members
of
the
immigration
law
section
of
the
los
angeles
county
bar
association
today
there
are
more
than
425
some
of
them
practice
immigration
law
full
time
and
others
on
an
occasional
basis
said
lawrence
liebenbaum
who
heads
the
immigration
section
but
immigration
lawyers
say
many
lawyers
with
no
knowledge
of
the
field
are
flocking
in
mr
montemayor
says
he
gets
5
or
10
calls
a
week
from
lawyers
thinking
about
taking
up
immigration
practice
fees
will
not
be
minimal
lawyers
worry
however
whether
adequate
legal
help
will
be
available
for
those
most
in
need
because
the
fees
for
a
family
with
a
straightforward
application
will
be
at
least
500
to
1000
aliens
applying
for
amnesty
will
also
have
to
pay
a
fee
which
has
not
yet
been
set
to
the
immigration
service
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
program
immigration
lawyers
expect
the
fee
to
be
less
than
100
immigration
officials
say
they
want
to
keep
the
fee
low
and
the
program
affordable
but
they
want
the
program
to
be
financed
entirely
by
applicant
fees
in
houston
many
immigration
lawyers
say
they
are
seeing
a
moderate
increase
in
business
because
of
the
new
law
jose
medina
a
noted
immigration
lawyer
said
he
saw
15
to
20
people
a
week
as
a
result
of
the
new
law
he
thinks
that
in
the
city
there
may
be
25000
amnesty
applications
lawyers
at
carecen
the
legal
arm
of
crecen
a
central
american
refugee
service
center
say
their
work
load
has
doubled
margaret
burkhart
a
lawyer
with
caracen
said
that
if
the
organization
and
other
nonprofit
legal
centers
doubled
their
staffs
they
could
handle
4000
applications
in
the
next
year
a
drop
in
the
bucket
thats
a
drop
in
the
bucket
she
said
she
estimates
as
many
as
100000
people
in
houston
could
qualify
for
amnesty
craig
h
baab
staff
director
for
the
coordinating
committee
on
immigration
law
of
the
american
bar
association
said
the
association
was
hoping
to
set
up
a
nationwide
network
of
lawyers
to
do
volunteer
work
for
aliens
going
through
the
amnesty
program
he
said
the
aba
was
also
putting
together
some
brochures
to
help
people
understand
the
law
people
have
to
have
access
to
sound
legal
advice
he
said
unfortunately
weve
already
heard
of
people
without
any
experience
giving
out
bad
advice
and
charging
to
boot
theres
a
lot
of
confusion
we
want
to
tell
people
to
relax
calm
down
dont
let
anyone
take
you
to
the
cleaners
the
law
doesnt
go
into
effect
until
may
documents
a
big
obstacle
lawyers
say
the
biggest
obstacle
will
be
adequate
documentation
which
could
help
prolong
cases
and
make
the
legal
logjam
even
worse
jonathan
lamb
a
houston
immigration
lawyer
estimates
80
percent
of
those
eligible
for
legalization
will
have
moderate
to
severe
document
problems
in
advance
of
regulations
on
documentation
lawyers
are
generally
advising
clients
to
gather
rent
receipts
telephone
bills
pay
checks
affidavits
from
neighbors
and
any
other
documents
they
can
put
together
to
verify
their
presence
in
the
united
states
lawrence
durnford
an
immigration
lawyer
in
el
paso
gives
all
clients
a
list
in
english
and
spanish
of
possible
documentation
ranging
from
the
standard
ones
like
rent
receipts
and
utilty
deposits
to
less
likely
ones
like
church
membership
and
membership
in
clubs
athletic
teams
organizations
and
unions
he
said
the
ingenuity
of
lawyers
and
clients
in
finding
documentation
would
make
the
difference
for
many
aliens
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
the
law
is
no
different
he
said
the
rich
always
get
better
legal
services
than
the
poor
and
that
will
happen
with
this
law
too
im
not
arguing
the
morality
of
it
its
just
a
fact
