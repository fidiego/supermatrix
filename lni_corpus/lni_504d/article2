in
the
debate
on
immigration
currently
rumbling
in
the
us
and
raging
in
europe
business
generally
comes
down
on
the
side
of
greater
openness
for
most
employers
the
merits
of
being
able
to
draw
from
a
bigger
pool
of
labour
seem
selfevident
economists
however
would
be
more
cautious
how
you
feel
about
immigration
will
depend
on
who
you
are
and
what
you
do
and
on
who
the
immigrants
are
too
some
of
the
most
influential
recent
academic
work
on
immigration
has
been
done
by
george
borjas
now
at
the
kennedy
school
of
government
at
harvard
his
simple
model
of
the
labour
market
assumes
a
fixed
demand
for
labour
immigration
raises
the
supply
of
labour
so
real
wages
fall
and
profits
rise
which
must
have
some
connection
to
business
leaders
enthusiasm
although
native
workers
then
earn
less
their
losses
are
more
than
offset
by
the
rise
in
returns
to
capital
so
overall
national
income
is
higher
indeed
the
greater
the
effect
of
immigration
on
wages
the
bigger
is
the
benefit
to
national
income
however
calculations
based
on
reasonably
accurate
figures
for
the
extent
of
immigration
and
the
sensitivity
of
wages
in
the
us
suggest
the
size
of
the
effect
may
not
be
enormous
prof
borjas
estimates
in
1994
were
that
the
total
gains
to
the
us
from
immigration
were
only
about
dollars
6bn
pounds
4bn
a
year
a
mere
01
per
cent
of
us
gross
domestic
product
and
certainly
less
than
dollars
20bn
the
redistribution
caused
by
immigration
is
greater
than
the
net
gain
the
same
assumptions
for
the
us
suggest
that
native
workers
lose
about
dollars
114bn
a
year
owing
to
immigration
about
19
per
cent
of
gdp
while
investors
gain
dollars
120bn
given
the
social
strains
caused
by
such
significant
redistribution
and
the
fact
that
the
net
fiscal
effects
of
immigration
are
unclear
all
the
estimates
of
the
balance
between
the
taxes
paid
by
immigrants
and
the
cost
of
the
services
they
use
are
highly
speculative
prof
borjas
analysis
suggests
that
on
balance
the
effects
on
natives
may
be
negative
if
that
extremely
simple
model
of
the
labour
market
is
made
more
realistic
however
scepticism
about
immigration
is
tempered
for
example
if
immigration
increases
the
spread
of
skills
and
knowledge
through
the
economy
whether
because
immigrants
bring
new
ideas
or
simply
because
a
larger
workforce
generates
more
connections
and
sparks
more
ideas
the
benefits
can
be
much
greater
another
refinement
to
the
model
incorporates
differences
in
skills
in
the
workforce
in
the
us
the
wages
of
skilled
workers
are
apparently
more
responsive
to
changes
in
supply
than
the
wages
of
unskilled
workers
as
it
is
the
fall
in
wages
that
generates
the
surplus
from
immigration
the
gains
will
be
greater
if
the
immigrants
are
skilled
rather
than
unskilled
using
some
plausible
estimates
of
the
responsiveness
of
wages
to
labour
supply
the
net
benefit
to
the
us
of
immigration
could
rise
to
more
than
dollars
40bn
a
year
if
only
skilled
workers
were
admitted
in
practice
however
immigrants
to
the
us
tend
to
be
less
skilled
than
the
native
population
in
1998
the
typical
immigrant
worker
in
the
us
earned
23
per
cent
less
than
the
typical
native
worker
immigrants
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
have
been
less
skilled
than
those
of
previous
waves
a
new
paper
by
ximena
clark
of
the
world
bank
timothy
hatton
of
essex
university
and
jeffrey
williamson
of
harvard
examines
why
this
may
have
happened
the
change
in
the
origins
of
immigrants
into
the
us
since
the
second
world
war
has
been
remarkable
in
the
1950s
europeans
most
of
them
from
western
europe
formed
more
than
half
the
total
by
the
1990s
they
were
down
to
just
5
per
cent
in
the
1900s
they
had
been
92
per
cent
the
proportions
from
developing
countries
have
risen
accordingly
with
the
share
from
the
caribbean
peaking
in
the
1970s
and
that
from
asia
in
the
1980s
the
shares
of
immigration
from
mexico
africa
and
eastern
europe
continue
to
increase
this
has
not
been
a
deliberate
act
of
policy
the
1965
reform
of
immigration
law
put
a
strong
priority
on
family
reunification
ahead
of
employment
as
a
justification
for
legal
immigration
it
was
argued
at
the
time
that
because
the
existing
stock
of
immigrants
was
largely
european
the
flow
of
new
immigrants
would
be
too
clark
hatton
and
williamson
set
up
a
model
of
worldwide
migration
to
the
us
to
see
why
that
argument
has
turned
out
to
be
so
wrong
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
whatever
a
countrys
immigration
policy
may
be
people
will
come
only
if
they
want
to
with
each
passing
decade
since
the
war
europeans
have
grown
less
needy
the
majority
of
immigrants
to
the
us
have
come
from
the
countries
closest
to
the
us
which
have
had
the
highest
proportions
of
young
people
and
have
offered
the
worst
economic
opportunities
one
conclusion
is
that
although
the
us
might
be
better
off
if
it
accepted
only
skilled
immigrants
cutting
off
unskilled
immigration
could
cut
off
immigration
altogether
several
countries
have
changed
immigration
requirements
in
attempts
to
increase
the
supply
of
skilled
workers
but
found
they
were
not
an
attractive
enough
prospect
to
attract
the
immigrants
they
wanted
as
prof
borjas
says
immigration
is
about
much
more
than
the
financial
considerations
it
touches
on
the
most
important
questions
of
justice
human
rights
and
conflicting
political
interests
the
case
for
open
immigration
will
have
to
be
made
on
those
arguments
as
well
as
the
