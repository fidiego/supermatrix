a
battle
in
congress
over
immigration
reform
has
left
participants
groping
through
a
virtual
fog
of
war
to
find
the
meaning
of
what
they
have
done
but
this
much
seems
clear
an
effort
to
fundamentally
change
americas
immigration
system
lies
mortally
wounded
in
the
crossfire
of
electionyear
politics
and
the
victors
include
one
of
the
oddest
alliances
that
washington
has
seen
in
recent
years
three
days
of
debate
on
the
house
floor
resulted
in
passage
thursday
of
a
bill
that
cracks
down
on
illegal
aliens
but
leaves
out
provisions
originally
intended
to
reduce
legal
immigration
as
well
from
the
christian
coalition
and
conservative
republicans
to
the
leadership
conference
for
civil
rights
and
liberal
democrats
the
cast
of
characters
opposing
cuts
in
legal
immigration
was
as
broad
as
the
array
of
issues
encompassed
in
the
overall
reform
effort
there
were
concerns
about
organized
crime
welfare
big
government
family
values
civil
liberties
population
growth
economic
competitiveness
the
protection
of
american
workers
and
freedom
from
religious
and
political
persecution
nevertheless
opponents
in
the
fight
agree
that
the
debate
has
fundamentally
changed
since
congress
seized
on
the
immigration
issue
a
year
ago
thanks
largely
to
the
emergence
of
a
potent
if
ephemeral
coalition
whose
driving
force
seems
to
be
americas
hightech
industries
in
a
sense
the
house
immigration
bill
that
passed
overwhelmingly
thursday
signified
a
repudiation
of
the
bipartisan
commission
on
immigration
reform
which
last
year
recommended
significant
cuts
in
legal
immigration
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
under
the
leadership
of
barbara
jordan
provided
the
basis
for
the
reform
bills
that
took
shape
in
the
house
and
senate
and
that
sought
to
deal
comprehensively
with
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
both
have
now
been
changed
substantially
the
senate
version
was
split
this
month
in
the
judiciary
committee
which
passed
the
sections
cracking
down
on
illegal
aliens
and
will
now
debate
legal
immigration
separately
the
house
voted
thursday
to
strip
most
provisions
on
legal
immigration
and
passed
a
bill
aimed
at
cutting
down
the
influx
of
illegal
immigrants
and
making
it
harder
for
them
to
get
jobs
and
government
benefits
the
clinton
administration
supported
the
jordan
commission
and
says
it
still
wants
to
see
legal
immigration
reform
but
it
swung
its
support
at
the
last
minute
behind
an
amendment
to
strip
the
house
bill
of
its
reductions
in
the
levels
of
family
and
employmentbased
legal
immigration
a
move
that
the
bills
sponsors
denounced
as
an
electionyear
stab
in
the
back
the
irrefutable
conclusion
is
that
they
did
it
simply
because
of
the
politics
said
rep
john
bryant
dtex
a
cosponsor
of
the
house
bill
they
believe
that
by
appearing
to
act
boldly
on
illegal
immigration
they
satisfy
that
voter
desire
and
by
punting
on
legal
immigration
they
will
not
make
any
ethnic
or
business
groups
mad
at
them
now
bryant
said
any
significant
legal
immigration
reform
is
dead
and
that
means
continued
dramatic
increases
in
americas
foreignborn
population
since
annual
legal
immigration
is
about
three
times
higher
than
illegal
immigration
one
of
bryants
chief
concerns
is
the
effect
of
immigration
on
population
growth
the
census
bureau
estimates
that
the
us
population
currently
about
263
million
will
reach
at
least
400
million
by
2050
and
may
rise
to
500
million
if
current
trends
continue
the
census
bureau
attributes
onethird
of
us
population
growth
to
immigration
both
legal
and
illegal
but
some
demographers
say
the
percentage
is
higher
rep
lamar
smith
rtex
the
house
bills
chief
sponsor
holds
out
hope
that
reform
of
legal
immigration
can
be
taken
up
another
day
perhaps
another
year
although
polls
show
that
more
than
80
percent
of
americans
want
lower
immigration
he
said
its
awfully
easy
for
special
interests
to
target
particular
members
of
congress
on
the
other
hand
asserts
immigration
advocate
frank
sharry
those
special
interests
represent
a
wide
cross
section
of
society
thursdays
vote
was
a
bipartisan
repudiation
of
deep
cuts
in
legal
immigration
he
said
it
means
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
legal
immigration
reform
this
year
it
is
going
to
be
on
the
terms
of
those
who
embrace
legal
immigration
as
a
good
thing
his
main
criticism
of
the
bill
is
that
it
was
ambushed
by
an
amendment
promoted
in
a
rare
floor
speech
by
house
speaker
newt
gingrich
rga
that
gives
states
the
option
to
deny
free
public
education
to
illegal
immigrant
children
it
is
a
provision
that
white
house
press
secretary
michael
mccurry
has
labeled
nutty
and
that
may
trigger
a
veto
if
a
bill
containing
it
reaches
president
clintons
desk
and
that
some
cynics
believe
may
have
been
the
point
its
quite
clear
that
once
again
gingrich
could
not
resist
the
red
meat
of
political
opportunity
and
decided
to
politicize
the
bill
for
the
fall
elections
said
bryant
the
idea
would
be
to
allow
republicans
to
portray
themselves
as
tougher
than
clinton
on
illegal
immigration
especially
in
such
key
states
as
california
i
fear
for
the
future
of
this
debate
and
the
future
of
politics
said
daniel
stein
head
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
advocates
deep
cuts
in
legal
immigration
the
house
bill
he
charged
is
a
shell
of
reform
in
large
part
because
republicans
were
unwilling
to
provide
the
basic
tools
to
enforce
immigration
law
he
cited
the
defeat
of
a
mandatory
verification
system
by
which
employers
could
check
the
employment
eligibility
of
jobseekers
and
the
rejection
of
a
secure
social
security
card
on
the
senate
side
he
noted
legislators
spurned
tougher
sanctions
on
employers
who
hire
illegal
aliens
and
all
but
buried
efforts
to
reform
employmentbased
immigration
congress
is
more
than
willing
to
put
the
onus
of
illegal
immigration
on
kids
but
its
not
willing
to
put
any
of
the
onus
on
employers
who
are
the
main
engines
of
illegal
immigration
