for
those
deciding
whether
to
illegally
immigrate
to
the
united
states
the
supreme
court
has
just
lowered
the
risks
and
increased
the
potential
benefits
the
courts
ruling
on
arizonas
immigration
law
this
week
offered
broad
support
for
the
obama
administrations
policy
of
limited
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
it
cited
with
approval
the
administrations
2011
memo
announcing
a
policy
of
prosecutorial
discretion
basically
limiting
immigration
enforcement
to
criminals
and
nationalsecurity
threats
noting
that
a
primary
feature
of
the
removal
system
is
the
broad
discretion
exercised
by
immigration
officials
such
discretion
also
underlies
the
administrations
announcement
last
week
that
it
would
authorize
work
permits
for
many
illegal
immigrants
who
entered
the
united
states
before
the
age
of
16
the
high
court
acknowledged
studies
finding
that
6
percent
to
9
percent
of
arizonas
population
is
there
illegally
one
study
cited
by
the
court
found
that
this
segment
of
the
states
population
was
responsible
for
218
percent
of
its
felonies
the
court
noted
that
problems
related
to
illegal
immigration
in
the
state
must
not
be
underestimated
but
none
of
that
prevented
the
court
from
striking
down
arizonas
best
effort
to
address
those
problems
the
message
to
other
states
no
matter
how
bad
illegal
immigration
gets
you
wont
be
allowed
to
do
much
about
it
the
court
did
preserve
a
narrow
opening
for
state
action
to
restrict
illegal
immigration
as
determined
last
year
in
chamber
of
commerce
v
whiting
states
can
revoke
the
business
licenses
of
employers
who
hire
illegal
immigrants
without
checking
their
documentation
using
the
everify
system
hazleton
pa
made
similar
use
of
licensing
powers
in
its
antiillegal
immigration
ordinances
the
high
court
also
upheld
arizonas
requirement
that
police
check
the
immigration
status
of
those
they
stop
or
arrest
if
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
theyre
in
the
country
illegally
the
federal
government
had
not
attacked
that
provision
as
authorizing
racial
profiling
because
the
same
argument
could
be
used
against
federal
immigration
laws
in
fact
such
immigration
status
checks
are
already
standard
operating
procedure
in
many
jurisdictions
throughout
the
united
states
arizona
lawmakers
made
it
a
legal
requirement
because
certain
sanctuary
cities
were
telling
their
police
not
to
check
immigration
status
overall
the
courts
ruling
prolongs
the
current
us
policy
of
keeping
numerical
immigration
limits
on
the
books
but
declining
to
enforce
them
moreover
it
prohibits
most
state
enforcement
of
those
limits
if
congress
repealed
all
our
immigration
laws
and
welcomed
everyone
who
would
like
to
enter
the
country
that
would
at
least
be
intellectually
coherent
the
current
policy
makes
no
sense
by
rewarding
and
protecting
illegal
immigrants
we
are
punishing
the
millions
awaiting
their
chance
to
immigrate
legally
with
so
little
risk
that
immigration
law
will
be
enforced
those
who
immigrate
illegally
get
the
last
laugh
