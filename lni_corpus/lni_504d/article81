after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
at
passing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
in
recent
years
lawmakers
say
that
new
bipartisan
talks
are
underway
on
a
plan
they
say
could
make
it
all
the
way
to
the
presidents
desk
speaking
on
sunday
morning
political
talk
shows
lawmakers
said
the
recent
election
in
which
latino
voters
largely
rejected
gop
antiimmigration
proposals
spurred
members
of
the
senate
to
resume
talks
on
immigration
reform
efforts
that
broke
off
two
years
ago
sen
lindsey
o
graham
rsc
speaking
sunday
on
the
cbs
show
face
the
nation
said
that
republicans
shot
themselves
in
the
foot
with
an
anti
immigration
campaign
message
so
i
intend
not
to
reload
this
gun
when
it
comes
to
hispanics
graham
said
i
intend
to
tear
this
wall
down
and
pass
an
immigration
reform
bill
thats
an
american
solution
to
an
american
problem
sen
charles
e
schumer
dny
said
on
nbcs
meet
the
press
that
talks
are
already
underway
graham
and
i
are
talking
to
our
colleagues
about
this
right
now
and
i
think
we
have
a
darn
good
chance
using
this
blueprint
to
get
something
done
this
year
schumer
said
schumer
said
the
starting
point
will
be
the
proposal
lawmakers
put
on
the
drawing
board
two
years
ago
which
would
feature
a
comprehensive
detailed
blueprint
on
immigration
reform
it
had
the
real
potential
for
bipartisan
support
based
on
the
theory
that
most
americans
are
for
legal
immigration
but
very
much
against
illegal
immigration
schumer
said
the
plan
according
to
schumer
would
focus
on
securing
the
nations
borders
creating
a
secure
document
that
employers
can
use
to
verify
that
employees
are
eligible
to
work
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigration
while
easing
the
process
for
workers
in
some
indemand
industries
and
creating
a
path
to
citizenship
for
those
already
in
the
country
the
remarks
from
lawmakers
came
just
days
after
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
urged
the
president
to
make
reforming
the
nations
immigration
laws
a
priority
in
his
second
term
aila
president
laura
lichter
urged
the
president
to
offer
a
solution
to
the
current
immigration
system
which
she
said
traps
wouldbe
citizens
and
legal
residents
in
a
way
that
prevents
them
from
benefiting
the
nation
and
offer
a
plan
to
serve
as
a
roadmap
for
new
americans
that
reflects
our
countrys
values
and
interests
and
the
spirit
with
which
our
nation
was
built
we
know
that
there
are
conflicting
priorities
and
many
challenges
facing
our
nation
lichter
said
in
a
statement
however
bipartisan
immigration
reform
is
not
just
another
issue
or
cause
obama
has
stated
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
aimed
at
easing
the
road
to
citizenship
while
simultaneously
strengthening
the
nations
borders
is
an
administration
priority
after
winning
reelection
last
week
obama
promised
to
reprioritize
the
issue
saying
in
his
victory
speech
if
youre
willing
to
work
hard
it
doesnt
matter
who
you
are
or
where
you
come
from
