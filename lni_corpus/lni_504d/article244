its
chaos
to
entertain
the
notion
that
the
current
method
of
dealing
with
immigration
cases
in
this
country
could
be
classified
as
a
system
is
a
fantasy
lawyers
are
at
a
loss
on
how
to
gauge
how
strong
or
weak
their
cases
are
and
some
federal
judges
are
fed
up
and
speaking
out
indiana
lawyer
reporter
mike
hoskins
has
a
revealing
story
about
the
subject
that
starts
on
page
1
of
this
issue
there
are
54
immigration
courts
which
are
overseen
by
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
within
the
us
department
of
justice
more
than
200
immigration
judges
hear
most
of
those
and
some
that
fall
under
a
different
umbrella
of
the
citizen
and
immigration
services
division
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
need
a
flow
chart
yet
the
chicago
immigration
court
where
indianabased
cases
are
heard
got
a
total
of
14446
immigration
cases
last
year
up
11
percent
from
the
previous
year
records
dont
easily
pinpoint
what
happened
from
there
and
the
eoir
can
only
provide
statistics
that
show
9
percent
of
immigration
judge
decisions
were
appealed
in
2006
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
an
11member
body
located
in
virginia
that
conducts
paper
reviews
of
cases
susan
eastwood
spokesperson
for
the
eoir
said
that
statistics
on
case
outcomes
arent
available
because
that
data
would
depend
on
what
was
appealed
and
heard
at
the
immigration
judge
level
retrieving
that
data
would
involve
pulling
records
from
the
immigration
courts
and
board
to
compare
outcomes
of
the
appeals
to
court
records
which
differ
in
how
they
are
maintained
and
tracked
she
told
il
that
information
could
be
pulled
together
from
various
sources
but
that
the
newspaper
would
have
to
file
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
to
obtain
it
that
doesnt
mean
no
ones

organization

clearinghouse
trac
at
syracuse
university
released
a
report
in
september
that
shows
disparities
exist
in
political
asylum
cases
with
denials
ranging
from
90
percent
in
some
jurisdictions
to
10
percent
in
others
some
of
the
chicago
immigration
judges
have
denial
rates
as
high
as
75
percent
the
groups
analysis
shows
we
find
this
kind
if
disparity
mystifying
does
the
judge
with
the
90
percent
denial
rate
have
a
rubber
stamp
handy
at
all
times
lawyers
and
legal
scholars
willing
to
talk
to
hoskins
for
his
story
were
quick
to
say
that
immigration
judges
were
doing
the
best
they
could
under
the
chaotic
circumstances
but
some
federal
judges
who
review
the
work
of
those
immigration
judges
arent
so
generous
judge
richard
posner
is
one
of
the
most
vocal
jurists
at
the
7th
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
dissent
he
had
this
to
say
about
the
work
he
saw
on
the
case
apouviepseakoda
v
gonzales
475
f3d

7th
cir
2007
the
immigration
judges
opinion
is
pervaded
by
gross
errors
of
fact
and
logic
and
read
in
light
of
the
hearing
transcript
is
an
embarrassment
to
american
justice
despite
hoskins
best
efforts
none
of
the
eight
immigration
judges
in
chicago
would
comment
on
the
record
and
the
court
referred
questions
to
the
main
eoir
office
in
virginia
leaders
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
union
also
did
not
return
calls
for
comment
for
his
story
we
understand
that
there
are
too
many
cases
and
too
few
judges
to
hear
them
we
also
understand
there
are
deadlines
that
must
be
met
in
these
cases
but
we
cant
help
but
recall
the
time
not
too
long
ago
when
the
marion
county
public
defender
just
stopped
taking
cases
because
he
believed
it
was
not
in
his
clients
best
interests
to
do
so
he
said
the
resources
allocated
to
him
werent
sufficient
to
provide
justice
to
his
clients
perhaps
immigration
judges
need
to
adopt
a
similar
policy
this
embarrassment
to
american
justice
as
judge
posner
so
aptly
put
it
needs
to
come
to
an
end
