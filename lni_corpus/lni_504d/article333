dividing
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
the
new
homeland
security
department
has
pleased
agency
critics
but
angered
proimmigration
groups
the
house
last
week
finalized
the
legislation
and
sent
it
to
president
bush
for
his
signature
it
creates
the
bureau
of
immigration
enforcement
to
guard
borders
and
enforce
immigration
laws
it
also
establishes
the
bureau
of
immigration
services
to
provide
immigration
benefits
and
process
naturalization
and
permanent
residence
applications
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
is
an
ardent
critic
of
the
ins
and
dan
stein
executive
director
says
the
division
of
duties
will
strengthen
border
security
it
shifts
the
burden
back
on
aliens
to
prove
they
have
a
right
to
enter
the
country
and
a
wholesale
rethinking
at
the
executive
level
on
how
to
deter
unlawful
conduct
mr
stein
said
im
hopeful
that
this
is
a
revolution
in
the
philosophy
of
immigration
management
mr
stein
said
angela
kelly
deputy
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
says
the
homeland
security
legislation
is
a
sweeping
bill
that
swallows
the
entire
service
and
threatens
to
slow
the
process
by
six
months
for
immigrants
all
eyes
will
be
on
the
administration
and
the
new
department
to
see
if
the
backlogs
and
delays
for
which
the
ins
was
infamous
are
made
better
or
worse
mrs
kelly
said
we
fear
that
the
way
immigration
services
are
structured
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
could
be
a
recipe
for
disaster
where
the
cure
is
worse
than
the
disease
the
national
immigration
forum
is
an
umbrella
group
of
proimmigration
groups
including
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
hispanic
civil
rights
organization
raul
yzaguirre
la
raza
president
said
his
group
has
lobbied
for
years
for
restructuring
but
the
changes
do
not
amount
to
reform
we
believe
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
include
significant
changes
in
the
way
ins
conducts
its
business
will
not
only
further
exacerbate
the
fundamental
problems
of
a
deeply
flawed
agency
but
also
compromise
our
nations
security
at
a
time
we
can
least
afford
it
mr
yzaguirre
said
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
also
criticized
the
move
saying
it
failed
to
provide
a
statutory
framework
for
the
role
of
immigration
courts
this
is
especially
important
because
in
the
majority
of
immigration
cases
the
immigration
courts
provide
the
only
opportunity
to
review
the
decisions
of
lowlevel
immigration
officers
immigration
judges
offer
critical
protections
against
mistakes
or
malfeasance
said
jeannie
butterfield
executive
director
mr
stein
said
the
service
was
transformed
during
the
carter
and
clinton
administrations
making
it
easier
for
immigrants
to
obtain
citizenship
the
role
of
the
agency
became
a
santa
claus
rolling
out
the
benefits
and
the
number
of
people
coming
in
swelled
dramatically
mr
stein
said
this
is
not
about
cheap
labor
immigration
lawyers
hotels
tourism
or
ethnic
lobbyists
its
about
public
safety
and
national
security
mr
stein
said
james
w
ziglar
is
the
current
commissioner
of
the
ins
but
will
retire
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
says
creation
of
the
new
department
is
critical
to
secure
the
nations
borders
by
moving
the
enforcement
of
the
nations
immigration
laws
to
a
much
larger
agency
the
border
enforcement
effort
will
be
enhanced
with
important
new
resources
and
strength

ziglar
