responding
to
pleas
from
immigration
judges
and
lawyers
who
say
the
nations
immigration
courts
are
faltering
under
a
crushing
caseload
the
american
bar
association
called
monday
for
congress
to
scrap
the
current
system
and
create
a
new
independent
court
for
immigration
cases
in
a
vote
at
its
semiannual
meeting
in
orlando
fla
the
lawyers
organization
endorsed
a
recommendation
for
a
separate
immigration
court
system
that
would
be
similar
to
federal
courts
that
decide
tax
cases
behind
the
seemingly
arcane
proposal
was
a
portrait
of
the
nations
immigration
courts
besieged
with
new
cases
arising
from
an
intensified
federal
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
and
challenged
by
critics
who
doubt
the
courts
impartiality
the
lawyers
described
the
courts
condition
in
a
report
of
more
than
1500
pages
released
last
week
the
immigration
courts
are
not
courts
at
all
in
the
way
americans
generally
think
of
them
they
are
part
of
the
department
of
justice
not
the
federal
judiciary
and
the
judges
although
they
wear
robes
and
sit
in
formal
courtrooms
are
employees
of
the
attorney
general
while
congress
has
debated
since
2006
an
overhaul
of
the
immigration
system
that
would
include
measures
to
give
legal
status
to
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
proposals
for
fixing
the
courts
have
been
largely
ignored
but
the
courts
have
become
an
overwhelmed
system
choked
by
an
exploding
caseload
said
lawrence
schneider
an
immigration
lawyer
at
arnold
porter
in
washington
and
a
main
author
of
the
bar
association
report
the
report
was
ordered
18
months
ago
by
the
associations
immigration
commission
a
nonpartisan
panel
of
lawyers
who
monitor
immigration
laws
and
recommend
changes
in
2008
the
report
found
homeland
security
agents
detained
378582
immigrants
and
deported
more
than
358000
last
year
the
report
found
with
enforcement
continuing
at
a
similar
pace
231
immigration
judges
heard
more
than
300000
cases
an
average
of
more
than
1200
for
each
judge
or
about
three
times
the
load
of
federal
district
judges
judges
are
overworked
frustrated
and
feel
like
they
are
on
a
treadmill
mr
schneider
said
immigration
cases
have
become
more
complex
especially
asylum
cases
where
immigrants
are
asking
to
remain
in
the
united
states
because
they
claim
to
fear
lifethreatening
violence
if
they
return
home
with
the
pace
of
their
work
accelerating
immigration
judges
often
feel
asylum
hearings
are
like
holding
death
penalty
cases
in
traffic
court
said
dana
l
marks
an
immigration
judge
in
san
francisco
and
the
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
despite
their
relatively
fast
performance
immigration
judges
backlogs
are
growing
the
report
found
leaving
more
immigrants
stranded
in
costly
detention
while
they
await
hearings
as
a
result
of
the
pressure
for
speedy
decisions
the
number
of
decisions
that
were
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit
courts
has
swelled
from
9
percent
of
decisions
in
2002
to
26
percent
in
2008
the
report
found
in
appeals
courts
in
new
york
and
california
states
with
large
numbers
of
immigrants
cases
from
the
immigration
courts
made
up
more
than
onethird
of
the
dockets
over
the
past
five
years
the
report
found
the
increase
in
cases
also
brought
more
complaints
from
lawyers
and
advocates
that
judges
working
for
the
justice
department
were
inclined
to
favor
the
government
there
have
been
increasing
concerns
about
the
propriety
of
housing
a
neutral
court
in
the
law
enforcement
arm
of
the
government
judge
marks
said
in
the
proposal
adopted
monday
the
bar
association
argued
that
immigration
courts
should
be
removed
from
the
department
of
justice
and
set
up
as
independent
courts
still
within
the
executive
branch
under
terms
in
article
i
of
the
constitution
the
highest
judges
would
be
appointed
by
the
president
and
approved
by
the
senate
the
courts
decisions
would
still
be
appealed
to
the
federal
appeals
courts
judges
and
lawyers
said
the
independent
courts
would
have
greater
credibility
and
more
power
to
seek
funds
from
congress
leading
to
more
resources
for
judges
shorter
terms
of
detention
for
immigrants
and
fewer
appeals
to
federal
circuit
courts
which
are
highly
costly
in
2006
attorney
general
alberto
r
gonzales
acknowledging
the
demands
on
the
immigration
courts
announced
a
plan
to
add
40
new
judges
but
as
of
late
last
year
only
9
had
been
named
last
week
attorney
general
eric
h
holder
jr
sought
to
financing
to
add
21
more
judges
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
the
immigration
bar
said
on
monday
that
it
would
review
the
american
bar
associations
proposal
laura
l
lichter
a
vice
president
of
the
association
said
the
courts
needed
more
resources
immediately
while
creating
a
new
court
might
take
a
long
time
