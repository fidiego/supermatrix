three
rusting
vessels
cramped
with
659
undocumented
chinese
limped
through
the
waters
off
san
diego
for
more
than
a
week
as
scrambling
us
officials
tried
to
coax
mexico
into
taking
the
unwanted
immigrants
mexico
finally
acquiesced
wednesday
and
will
repatriate
the
refugees
but
experts
say
the
incident
symbolizes
us
immigration
policy
chaotic
and
adrift
and
its
inability
to
stem
a
vast
tide
of
illegal
aliens
an
overwhelmed
immigration
and
naturalization
service
needs
more
money
more
people
and
stronger
laws
to
handle
the
record
number
of
immigrants
entering
the
country
but
what
the
nation
most
needs
experts
say
is
a
longterm
strategic
policy
with
the
consistent
backing
of
the
president
congress
and
state
and
local
governments
unfortunately
theres
a
firehouse
environment
the
bell
rings
youve
got
people
hitting
the
coast
and
you
go
after
them
without
attending
to
a
far
broader
problem
says
james
blume
assistant
director
of
the
us
general
accounting
office
alan
nelson
who
headed
the
ins
from
1981
to
1989
accuses
the
bush
administration
of
failing
to
fight
for
a
sensible
and
enforceable
immigration
policy
but
the
clinton
administrations
failure
to
articulate
an
immigration
policy
of
its
own
has
others
fretting
theres
a
lot
of
rhetoric
coming
out
of
the
administration
says
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
advocates
new
limits
but
at
this
point
he
says
no
real
policy
has
emerged
i
think
were
in
limbo
clintons
nomination
of
immigration
lawyer
doris
meissner
to
be
ins
commissioner
has
stirred
some
optimism
that
she
may
provide
real
leadership
and
a
refreshingly
professional
instead
of
political
perspective
still
his
decision
to
reverse
campaign
pledges
and
continue
bushs
policy
of
turning
away
boatloads
of
haitians
without
asylum
hearings
has
suggested
to
some
that
politics
will
again
master
policy
i
dont
see
its
necessary
to
pin
him
to
the
wall
on
this
says
demetrios
papademetriou
immigration
policy
director
at
the
labor
department
during
the
bush
administration
but
if
clintons
campaign
statements
favoring
tolerance
and
diversity
turn
out
to
be
no
more
than
rhetorical
flourishes
then
he
ought
to
be
held
accountable
a
coherent
national
immigration
policy
doesnt
have
to
be
invented
anew
says
lawrence
fuchs
acting
chairman
of
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
the
select
commission
on
immigration
proposed
one
in
1981
but
congress
didnt
carry
it
through
all
they
way
he
says
fuchs
also
says
congress
failure
to
establish
a
fraudproof
work
identity
card
undermined
the
effectiveness
of
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
political
asylum
though
widely
regarded
as
a
small
problem
in
comparison
to
the
number
of
aliens
overstaying
visas
is
the
most
often
cited
flaw
in
us
immigration
policy
congress
is
now
considering
a
bill
that
will
expedite
asylum
hearings
and
allow
one
appeal
sending
those
abusing
the
system
back
to
china
will
send
the
message
youre
wasting
your
30000
if
you
dont
have
a
legitimate
claim
says
gene
mcnary
who
resigned
as
head
of
ins
in
january
but
no
policy
will
succeed
immigration
experts
say
until
the
nation
streamlines
deportation
laws
and
court
proceedings
and
significantly
increases
the
number
of
trained
asylum
officers
there
are
only
150
immigrant
rights
advocates
are
troubled
by
the
calls
for
tougher
asylum
rules
and
more
money
to
bolster
border
security
they
are
particularly
hesitant
to
throw
funds
at
the
ins
without
a
clear
policy
we
shouldnt
be
talking
about
more
multiterrain
vehicles
and
weapons
without
first
talking
about
what
creates
the
flow
says
margie
mchugh
of
the
new
york
immigration
coalition
people
are
moving
about
the
globe
more
freely
than
ever
instead
of
welcoming
the
future
were
trying
to
turn
the
clock
back
but
rosemary
jenks
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
says
a
much
more
restrictive
response
is
needed
we
simply
dont
have
the
resources
to
resettle
millions
of
people
who
wish
to
come
here
