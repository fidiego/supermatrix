say
california
immigration
policy
is
comparable
to
new
arizona

debate
over
arizonas
new
immigration
law
has
raised
questions
about
californias
immigration
policy
similar
wording
in
the
laws
has
caused
some
experts
to
question
the
call
from
california
cities
and
individuals
to
boycott
arizona
although
they
agree
that
the
laws
have
some
similarities
there
tends
to
be
disagreement
on
the
differences
in
the
laws
everybody
is
trying
to
say
that
we
have
a
law
just
like
arizonas
law
and
it
really
isnt
it
has
similarities
but
the
differences
are
pretty
extraordinary
said
tim
donnelly
a
republican
candidate
in
the
59th
district
assembly
race
and
founder
of
the
minuteman
civil
defense
corps
of
california
donnellys
biggest
quarrel
with
the
comparison
of
the
laws
is
that
californias
policy
allows
police
to
inquire
about
a
persons
legal
status
and
call
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
arizonas
law
allows
police
to
arrest
and
detain
a
person
suspected
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
however
californias
policy
is
not
enforced
due
to
political
reasons
donnelly
said
the
ice
agent
might
want
to
come
down
there
and
pick
up
and
deport
those
suspected
to
be
illegally
in
the
country
but
theyre
not
allowed
by
their
superiors
he
said
so
thats
really
where
the
problem
is
its
not
with
the
agents
in
the
field
unlike
california
policy
arizonas
law
addresses
sanctuary
cities
and
allows
citizens
to
sue
the
government
for
not
enforcing
immigration
laws
the
wording
of
arizonas
law
is
much
stronger
than
californias
which
has
led
pitzer
college
professor
jose
calderon
and
other
latino
activists
to
lobby
against
the
arizona
law
calderon
who
teaches
sociology
and
chicano
studies
at
the
college
in
claremont
said
the
way
the
laws
are
written
there
is
a
difference
between
police
cooperation
in
checking
for
immigration
status
i
think
thats
why
there
is
such
a
clamor
about
it
calderon
said
it
allows
police
officers
to
question
anyone
they
suspect
of
being
an
undocumented
immigrant
and
makes
it
a
state
crime
to
be
in
the
state
illegally
lori
haley
a
public
affairs
officer
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
said
ice
works
with
local
law
enforcement
through
various
initiatives
but
agencies
tend
to
have
their
own
policies
agencies
have
their
own
policies
and
we
represent
that
haley
said
we
have
our
job
to
do
and
we
do
it
and
try
to
work
as
best
we
can
with
what
the
local
police
do
the
ice
section
287g
program
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
us
department
of
homeland
security
to
enter
into
agreements
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
allow
designated
officers
to
perform
immigration
law
enforcement
functions
the
san
bernardino
county
sheriffs
department
has
implemented
the
program
in
its
jails
to
identify
criminal
illegal
immigrants
said
cindy
beavers
sheriffs
spokeswoman
theres
a
whole
series
of
questions
that
are
asked
to
every
single
person
who
is
booked
into
our
facilities
and
during
that
time
their
legal
status
in
the
us
may
come
into
question
beavers
said
at
that
point
an
inmates
paperwork
is
flagged
and
forwarded
to
an
official
with
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
who
would
interview
the
inmate
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
taken
before
an
immigration
judge
beavers
said
the
departments
implementation
of
287g
is
the
extent
of
its
immigration
enforcement
beavers
said
if
we
stop
somebody
whether
its
a
traffic
stop
or
for
some
criminal
activity
we
dont
question
what
their
immigration
status
is
beavers
said
were
not
immigration
officers
and
sheriff
rod
hoops
made
that
clear
to
all
of
his
deputies
since
january
2006
the
program
has
identified
more
than
70000
individuals
mostly
in
jails
who
are
suspected
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
according
to
ice
there
are
71
active
agreements
to
use
the
program
and
more
than
1120
officers
have
been
trained
and
certified
the
los
angeles
county
sheriffs
department
does
not
check
for
immigration
status
while
on
patrol
but
it
does
assist
the
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
by
interviewing
inmates
to
be
released
from
county
jails
sheriffs
spokesman
steve
whitmore
said
if
theyre
going
to
be
released
from
the
county
jail
we
interview
foreignborn
inmates
and
give
that
information
to
ice
its
random
and
its
not
an
exact
science
whitmore
said
however
he
said
that
all
gang
members
are
interviewed
to
determine
their
immigration
status
before
they
are
released
the
los
angeles
county
sheriffs
department
has
also
implemented
the
287g
program
in
its
jails
congressman
gary
miller
rbrea
said
the
boycott
of
arizona
being
pursued
by
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
hypocritical
they
come
back
to
washington
dc
every
year
wanting
100
million
a
year
to
incarcerate
illegal
immigrants
he
said
they
want
to
go
make
this
statement
but
then
want
the
federal
government
to
pick
up
the
cost
of
incarcerating
the
illegals
in
jails
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
you
want
to
be
a
sanctuary
city
but
want
the
federal
government
to
pick
up
the
cost
calderon
said
the
expansion
of
287g
in
riverside
and
san
bernardino
counties
is
giving
law
enforcement
more
authority
to
do
work
that
should
be
left
to
the
federal
government
there
have
been
many
instances
where
theyve
lead
to
arbitrary
arrests
for
minor
offenses
where
due
process
rights
are
violated
calderon
said
not
only
will
the
federal
government
have
the
ability
to
enforce
immigration
laws
in
arizona
but
local
and
state
authorities
will
be
able
to
he
said
nowhere
in
the
arizona
law
does
it
define
what
is
the
criteria
that
you
would
use
in
terms
of
having
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
people
just
to
stop
and
question
them
on
their
immigration
status
calderon
said
that
is
really
far
different
than
what
is
written
in
the
california
policy
and
really
opens
it
up
for
state
and
local
police
just
to
stop
anyone
on
the
suspicion
of
how
theyre
dressed
