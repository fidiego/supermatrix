after
years
of
simmering
in
the
background
illegal
immigration
has
quickly
emerged
as
one
of
the
key
issues
in
virginias
nov
6
election
particularly
in
northern
virginia
where
voters
say
they
are
seeking
candidates
who
will
address
it
according
to
a
new
washington
post
poll
threequarters
of
likely
voters
in
virginia
said
immigration
is
important
to
their
votes
in
the
election
for
state
and
local
offices
while
just
a
year
ago
immigration
ranked
seventh
of
10
listed
issues
in
a
post
poll
before
the
us
senate
race
since
then
the
percentage
of
virginia
voters
calling
immigration
extremely
or
very
important
to
their
vote
has
jumped
15
points
thats
heartening
said
corey
a
stewart
rat
large
chairman
of
the
prince
william
board
of
county
supervisors
who
spearheaded
efforts
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigrants
for
many
people
this
has
really
become
a
serious
threat
to
their
quality
of
life
there
is
a
widespread
sense
that
illegal
immigration
is
a
local
problem
particularly
after
congresss
failure
to
approve
an
immigration
overhaul
this
summer
that
has
vaulted
the
issue
into
prominence
it
has
also
gained
attention
because
of
what
people
in
both
parties
say
is
a
predominantly
republican
tactic
to
turn
attention
away
from
president
bushs
sagging
approval
ratings
an
unpopular
war
and
the
states
costly
new
abusivedriver
fees
its
a
conscious
political
strategy
by
virginia
republicans
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
an
immigrant
advocacy
group
in
washington
what
happens
in
virginia
in
the
legislative
races
will
be
a
pretty
good
test
of
whether
this
works
or
not
republicans
across
the
state
and
a
few
democrats
in
conservative
districts
have
seized
the
issue
unveiling
countless
proposals
to
curb
illegal
immigration
and
talking
it
up
on
the
campaign
trail
in
the
past
two
statewide
elections
the
unsuccessful
republican
candidates
for
us
senate
and
governor
tried
to
make
immigration
an
issue
but
it
did
not
resonate
as
deeply
with
voters
as
such
problems
as
traffic
congestion
transportation
and
the
states
economy
are
still
the
biggest
issues
facing
virginia
today
according
to
the
post
poll
but
immigration
has
made
a
surge
in
voter
interest
this
fall
among
likely
voters
61
percent
called
illegal
immigration
a
problem
where
they
live
a
majority
of
likely
voters
who
said
immigration
is
extremely
important
would
like
to
see
republicans
maintain
control
of
the
general
assembly
and
those
who
call
the
issue
the
states
top
problem
generally
prefer
the
gop
approach
but
overall
virginians
give
democrats
a
narrow
edge
on
handling
immigration
and
more
voters
would
like
to
see
the
democrats
take
over
the
state
legislature
i
think
democrats
would
have
a
better
solution
said
barbara
humphreys
57
of
buena
vista
who
ranks
immigration
as
a
top
issue
along
with
the
economy
and
the
war
in
iraq
political
analysts
say
democrats
could
make
gains
in
the
republicanled
legislature
nov
6
when
all
140
house
and
senate
seats
are
up
for
grabs
democrats
could
take
control
of
the
senate
for
the
first
time
since
1999
and
pick
up
a
halfdozen
or
so
seats
in
the
house
of
delegates
analysts
say
a
majority
of
virginians
53
percent
said
they
want
state
and
local
governments
to
do
a
lot
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
an
additional
third
said
they
want
some
action
although
state
and
local
governments
can
do
little
to
resolve
immigration
concerns
in
part
because
federal
and
state
laws
provide
many
protections
for
illegal
immigrants
six
in
10
likely
virginia
voters
said
they
would
be
more
inclined
to
support
an
office
seeker
who
advocated
aggressive
state
and
local
action
against
illegal
immigrants
i
think
we
need
to
strengthen
our
borders
said
lori
robinson
45
of
norfolk
who
plans
to
vote
for
republicans
next
month
partly
because
she
thinks
they
would
be
stronger
on
immigration
im
looking
for
someone
to
stand
up
and
say
this
is
what
this
country
needs
you
want
to
help
everyone
but
you
cant
clearly
theres
a
lot
of
frustration
with
the
broken
immigration
system
said
tim
freilich
legal
director
for
the
virginia
justice
center
for
farm
and
immigrant
workers
what
were
seeing
are
state
and
local
elected
officials
trying
to
do
something
what
we
need
now
is
comprehensive
immigration
reform
we
dont
need
meanspirited
shortsighted
results
in
recent
months
prince
william
and
loudoun
counties
have
voted
to
curtail
government
services
to
illegal
immigrants
and
herndon
voted
to
close
a
controversial
daylaborer
center
frequented
by
many
illegal
immigrants
last
week
the
prince
william
board
also
unanimously
passed
a
proposal
that
will
allow
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
who
breaks
the
law
fairfax
officials
are
trying
to
determine
which
county
services
can
be
denied
to
illegal
immigrants
although
they
havent
decided
to
do
that
republicans
dispute
the
notion
that
they
are
exploiting
the
immigration
issue
to
gain
political
advantage
saying
they
are
responding
to
complaints
from
voters
if
youre
hyping
a
nonissue
you
wouldnt
get
these
results
stewart
said
gerald
e
connolly
d
who
is
running
for
reelection
as
chairman
of
the
fairfax
county
board
of
supervisors
said
many
politicians
are
making
false
claims
about
what
they
can
do
some
politicians
have
declared
open
season
on
a
particular
group
of
immigrants
who
are
here
that
goes
way
beyond
unpalatable
it
puts
people
at
risk
i
can
tell
you
ive
spoken
to
a
lot
of
immigrant
communities
this
has
made
them
very
anxious
we
have
a
sad
history
in
virginia
that
we
dont
want
to
repeat
connolly
said
nearly
seven
in
10
virginians
polled
said
the
federal
government
has
not
done
enough
to
deal
with
the
issue
but
many
also
see
illegal
immigration
as
a
state
and
local
issue
and
not
one
that
the
federal
government
alone
should
address
about
one
in
eight
virginians
call
immigration
the
most
or
secondmost
important
problem
in
the
state
fiftyone
percent
of
those
surveyed
said
illegal
immigration
is
a
problem
where
they
live
including
20
percent
who
said
it
is
a
very
serious
problem
steve
fowler
57
a
consultant
who
lives
in
manassas
describes
immigration
and
transportation
as
his
top
issues
after
abortion
to
me
the
issue
is
whether
they
broke
the
law
to
come
here
he
said
but
bill
maxwell
70
a
retiree
who
has
lived
in
alexandria
for
four
decades
said
immigration
is
not
a
top
priority
i
think
republicans
are
making
a
big
deal
out
of
it
said
maxwell
who
has
voted
for
both
parties
in
the
past
but
plans
to
vote
democratic
in
november
on
most
questions
about
immigration
there
are
wide
differences
by
party
and
region
although
58
percent
of
republicans
and
55
percent
of
independents
want
much
more
local
action
on
illegal
immigration
fewer
democrats
43
percent
do
and
almost
threequarters
of
republicans
are
more
likely
to
support
a
candidate
who
wants
strong
action
against
illegal
immigrants
nearly
double
the
percentage
among
democrats
republicans
would
do
a
better
job
said
pat
holub
42
who
is
in
the
navy
and
lives
in
springfield
liberals
have
a
tendency
to
want
to
do
everything
for
everybody
nearly
a
third
of
likely
voters
who
live
north
of
the
rappahannock
river
said
immigration
was
one
of
the
top
two
issues
in
the
state
and
77
percent
said
illegal
immigration
was
a
problem
in
their
communities
37
percent
called
it
a
very
serious
problem
those
numbers
surged
higher
in
prince
william
where
half
of
all
residents
called
immigration
the
most
or
secondmost
important
issue
facing
the
state
and
a
majority
classified
illegal
immigration
as
a
very
serious
local
problem
roy
beck
executive
director
of
numbersusa
a
group
that
advocates
limits
on
immigration
and
penalties
for
illegal
immigrants
called
the
poll
results
surprising
because
immigration
has
not
been
an
issue
taken
on
by
a
statewide
leader
in
virginia
as
it
has
in
some
states
beck
attributed
some
of
the
interest
to
increased
attention
to
immigration
by
the
media
and
to
the
enormous
alterations
in
the
states
landscape
people
across
virginia
especially
in
northern
virginia
they
are
witnessing
a
rapid
change
he
said
the
poll
was
conducted
by
telephone
oct
4
through
8
among
a
random
sample
of
1144
virginia
adults
including
additional
interviews
with
randomly
selected
residents
of
loudoun
and
prince
william
counties
the
results
from
the
full
poll
have
a
margin
of
sampling
error
of
plus
or
minus
three
percentage
points
it
is
larger
among
subgroups
