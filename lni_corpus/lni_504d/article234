with
the
immigration
debate
continuing
to
rage
on
both
locally
and
nationally
one
minnesota
lawyers
group
is
doing
its
part
to
educate
the
profession
and
the
public
on
issues
affecting
immigrants
in
early
may
the
minnesotadakotas
chapter
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
will
hold
a
twoday
regional
conference
in
eagan
that
will
include
topics
of
interest
not
only
to
immigration
attorneys
but
also
to
lawyers
in
a
host
of
other
practice
areas
impacted
by
the
immigrants
minneapolis
immigration
attorney
david
wilson
chair
of
the
local
aila
chapter
explained
that
particularly
in
the
current
climate
of
heavy
enforcement
immigration
issues
are
beginning
to
pervade
many
areas
of
the
law
including
family
law
employment
law
and
even
corporate
and
business
law
a
simple
question
of
whether
someone
was
hired
properly
can
mushroom
into
a
much
bigger
problem
for
a
company
wilson
told
minnesota
lawyer
so
were
trying
to
reach
out
to
the
broader
legal
community
with
our
conference
to
educate
them
on
those
issues
in
the
beginning
the
national
group
got
its
start
back
in
1946
according
to
minneapolis
immigration
attorney
sam
myers
who
served
as
president
of
aila
from
199192
it
was
initially
formed
as
a
way
for
immigration
attorneys
to
share
information
but
the
groups
purpose
and
strategic
goals
as
well
as
its
membership
have
grown
exponentially
over
the
years
it
now
boasts
more
than
12000
members
consisting
of
attorneys
and
law
professors
who
practice
and
teach
immigration
law
the
national
group
seeks
to
provide
a
voice
for
immigrants
representing
them
in
the
political
arena
said
wilson
it
is
also
vocal
in
providing
information
about
proposed
changes
in
immigration
law
to
members
of
congress
and
to
the
executive
branch
when
its
forming
regulations
he
added
the
minnesotadakotas
chapter
is
one
of
36
aila
chapters
located
throughout
the
country
it
was
created
in
the
late
1970s
largely
through
the
effort
of
retired
minneapolis
immigration
attorney
jerome
ingber
myers
worked
with
ingber
to
get
the
local
group
going
he
recalled
that
at
least
three
attorneys
were
needed
to
start
a
chapter
and
thats
exactly
what
they
had
he
added
that
at
the
time
there
were
only
six
immigration
lawyers
in
the
state
ingber
served
as
the
first
chair
of
the
group
the
local
chapter
has
since
grown
to
more
than
200
members
with
much
of
that
growth
occurring
in
the
past
five
years
wilson
attributes
much
of
the
recent
growth
to
the
fact
that
immigration
issues
have
begun
to
dominate
national
and
even
local
politics
the
mission
of
local
aila
chapters
is
fundamentally
the
same
as
that
of
the
national
association
the
local
chapters
implement
the
strategies
decided
by
the
national
group
said
myers
in
that
sense
they
are
the
backbone
of
the
association
correcting
information
education
of
the
public
attorneys
and
even
the
government
comprises
a
large
portion
of
the
local
chapters
work
there
is
so
much
demonizing
of
immigration
that
goes
on
and
so
much
of
it
is
based
on
just
absolute
incorrect
information
said
wilson
as
an
example
wilson
said
that
hed
recently
heard
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
point
to
h1b
visas
as
the
reason
philadelphia
teenagers
dont
have
computerprogrammer
jobs
h1b
visas
allow
us
employers
to
employ
foreign
guest
workers
in
specialty
occupations
there
is
just
no
correlation
between
the
two
said
wilson
its
a
failure
of
education
not
a
failure
of
immigration
so
when
politicians
make
grandiose
statements
like
that
we
at
least
try
to
offer
a
logical
educated
and
specific
response
in
an
effort
to
educate
local
attorneys
on
specific
immigration
issues
the
chapter
holds
one
or
two
continuing
legal
education
seminars
each
month
on
a
range
of
topics
relevant
to
many
practice
areas
wilson
stressed
that
many
issues
come
up
today
that
are
far
beyond
just
whether
a
client
is
in
the
country
legally
individuals
who
practice
employment
law
or
do
corporate
representation
have
become
really
interested
in
the
overlap
with
immigration
he
explained
but
immigration
issues
are
also
coming
up
for
criminal
attorneys
and
family
law
attorneys
they
have
an
interest
in
knowing
a
little
more
about
immigration
law
so
they
can
advise
their
clients
a
little
more
competently
while
the
monthly
seminars
are
a
way
for
members
to
gain
information
and
get
together
the
primary
method
they
use
to
keep
in
touch
is
a
listserv
there
they
exchange
and
discuss
cases
coming
out
of
various
immigration
agencies
and
courts
all
over
the
country
immigration
law
is
practiced
on
a
nationwide
basis
even
though
we
may
be
based
here
we
try
to
stay
in
tune
to
what
is
going
on
nationally
and
work
with
each
other
to
communicate
trends
said
wilson
myers
echoed
that
sentiment
chapter
members
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
with
each
other
he
said
i
dont
go
a
day
without
receiving
five
or
six
emails
from
chapter
members
dealing
with
dysfunction
aila
and
its
local
chapters
face
a
variety
of
challenges
in
todays
climate
of
heavy
immigration
enforcement
and
proposed
reform
according
to
wilson
one
of
those
challenges
is
dealing
with
the
recent
change
in
rhetoric
relating
to
immigration
the
country
has
shifted
from
a
healthy
discussion
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
what
that
may
look
like
to
a
general
antiimmigrant
sentiment
he
said
also
difficult
is
dealing
with
increased
federal
enforcement
of
immigration
policies
the
federal
government
is
becoming
very
aggressive
in
how
its
going
after
individuals
whether
its
a
person
who
crossed
the
border
illegally
or
whether
its
the
employer
wilson
said
he
noted
that
in
the
last
18
months
minnesota
jumped
from
two
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agents
to
more
than
30
finally
members
contend
that
dealing
with
the
failings
of
immigration
agencies
themselves
is
keeping
them
busy
myers
referred
to
the
immigration
system
as
dysfunctional
there
are
backlogs
long
waiting
lines
and
processing
delays
the
agency
is
far
more
inaccessible
now
wilson
agreed
with
immigration
services
you
have
an
agency
that
will
gladly
take
your
money
but
wont
provide
the
benefit
in
a
timely
manner
he
said
if
this
was
a
consumer
transaction
they
would
have
been
sued
several
times
over
for
consumer
rights
issues
the
upcoming
regional
conference
will
address
these
and
many
other
immigration
related
issues
local
and
national
speakers
will
discuss
things
like
i9
compliance
ice
enforcement
tactics
conflicts
of
interest
corporate
immigration
policies
and
criminal
liability
for
employers
and
workers
to
be
frank
if
i
was
a
corporate
attorney
and
my
job
was
to
oversee
hr
somewhere
this
type
of
program
is
exactly
the
type
of
program
id
want
and
thats
what
were
trying
to
offer
