the
ongoing
debate
in
utah
about
immigration
reform
is
primed
to
kick
up
yet
another
dust
storm
before
years
end
when
several
bills
pertaining
to
immigration
are
introduced
in
the
state
legislature
but
to
give
adequate
context
to
any
analysis
of
statebased
efforts
to
reform
immigration
law
one
must
first
recognize
that
immigration
is
a
fundamentally
federal
issue
although
a
strong
undertow
of
debate
about
whether
states
have
any
business
legislating
immigration
is
permeating
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
public
square
on
the
heels
of
arizonas
enactment
of
its
own
immigration
bill
nobodys
arguing
that
immigration
reform
is
first
and
foremost
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
which
leads
to
the
proverbial
elephant
in
the
room
at
a
time
when
immigration
is
the
hottest
of
hotbutton
topics
in
the
beehive
state
why
hasnt
utahs
congressional
delegation
parlayed
the
concerns
if
its
constituents
into
any
kind
of
palpable
immigration
reform
to
find
answers
to
that
question
the
deseret
news
contacted
the
five
members
of
utahs
congressional
delegation
sens
orrin
hatch
and
bob
bennett
as
well
as
reps
jim
matheson
rob
bishop
and
jason
chaffetz
hatch
and
the
three
representatives
took
time
to
answer
questions
and
share
insights
about
immigration
reform
bennett
whose
18year
tenure
as
the
states
junior
senator
is
ending
did
not
respond
to
interview
requests
to
their
credit
each
of
the
four
respondents
offered
salient
articulate
insight
into
the
complexities
of
washingtons
inability
to
address
immigration
nobody
proffered
silverbullet
explanations
for
why
immigration
policy
is
broken
or
how
to
immediately
fix
it
but
the
amalgamation
of
their
various
viewpoints
provides
a
threedimensional
world
view
of
the
challenges
that
lay
ahead
their
varied
explanations
about
the
institutional
failure
of
congress
to
reform
immigration
law
include
references
to
a
new
immigration
bill
in
the
senate
the
terrorist
attacks
of
911
partisan
politics
border
security
a
19th
century
english
author
and
a
comedy
central
comedian
ironically
the
one
thing
the
quartet
most
strongly
agrees
with
each
other
about
is
that
congress
definitely
should
have
done
something
about
immigration
by
now
the
insider
hatchs
nearly
34
years
in
the
senate
afford
him
impeccable
credentials
im
hardly
a
johnnycomelately
on
immigration
issues
hatch
said
in
an
email
i
am
and
always
have
been
actively
involved
in
tackling
illegal
immigration
i
have
taken
the
initiative
to
increase
immigration
enforcement
in
utah
including
bringing
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
quickresponse
teams
to
our
state
creating
an
immigration
court
and
establishing
an
ice
field
office
director
position
to
address
our
states
immigration
concerns
i
also
brought
the
287g
crossdeputizing
program
and
recently
helped
bring
the
secure
communities
program
to
utah
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
somebody
who
has
done
more
on
immigration
enforcement
for
utah
than
i
have
done
he
lays
much
of
the
blame
for
the
current
stalemate
on
federal
immigration
reform
on
democrats
democrats
are
in
control
of
congress
and
certainly
carry
the
lions
share
of
the
blame
hatch
said
for
example
throughout
this
congress
the
democrats
have
tried
to
create
buzz
around
a
flawed
bill
they
know
will
never
pass
in
an
effort
to
get
more
people
out
to
vote
thats
just
pathetic
really
you
cant
play
political
football
on
something
this
important
the
problem
doesnt
end
with
congress
the
obama
administration
is
also
playing
politics
with
immigration
to
expand
its
liberal
base
on
sept
29
hatch
gave
a
glimpse
into
how
he
thinks
immigration
reform
should
proceed
when
he
introduced
the
strengthening
our
commitment
to
legal
immigration
and
americas
security
act
among
other
things
the
bill
seeks
to
mandate
increased
cooperation
between
local
law
enforcement
and
ice
agents
as
well
as
forbid
members
of
known
gang
or
criminal
organizations
from
receiving
visas
to
come
to
the
us
while
utah
is
not
a
border
state
the
immigration
problems
we
face
are
a
residual
effect
of
a
porous
border
hatch
said
i
dare
say
that
many
states
across
the
nation
are
in
a
similar
situation
that
is
why
i
introduced
this
bill
to
shed
light
on
some
very
serious
issues
that
have
been
overlooked
for
too
long
the
veteran
currently
seeking
reelection
for
a
sixth
term
matheson
is
the
only
democrat
among
utahs
delegation
and
the
most
senior
of
the
three
utahns
in
the
house
of
representatives
with
nearly
a
decade
of
service
on
capitol
hill
matheson
can
contextualize
the
source
and
cause
of
the
current
uproar
over
immigration
for
example
he
believes
the
federal
government
hasnt
reformed
immigration
because
of
the
911
terrorist
attacks
i
think
that
there
was
a
certain
level
of
momentum
moving
in
the
direction
of
addressing
this
issue
when
i
first
got
in
office
in
2001
mathson
said
i
think
that
momentum
was
stopped
by
the
sept
11
attacks
at
that
point
it
was
no
longer
an
agenda
item
in
washington
and
in
fact
after
sept
11
a
number
of
restrictions
were
put
in
on
for
example
the
guest
worker
programs
that
in
some
ways
made
it
more
challenging
for
folks
to
play
by
the
rules
i
think
that
was
clearly
a
moment
that
affected
the
issue
and
really
took
it
off
the
table
without
exempting
his
own
party
from
criticism
matheson
blames
partisan
politics
for
sidetracking
the
immigration
issue
both
political
parties
he
said
have
got
to
stop
leveraging
this
issue
for
the
next
election
his
threepart
plan
for
fixing
immigration
includes
increased
enforcement
for
the
use
of
everify
a
tool
employers
can
use
to
confirm
the
immigration
status
of
a
prospective
worker
strengthening
border
security
and
improving
the
guestworker
program
that
allows
immigrants
to
legally
come
work
in
the
united
states
under
the
proviso
they
will
eventually
return
home
there
are
very
credible
pragmatic
nonideological
steps
that
could
be
taken
on
this
issue
matheson
said
that
i
would
like
to
think
that
people
in
congress
and
members
of
both
parties
could
reach
consensus
on
those
issues
the
pragmatist
bishop
feels
any
discussion
of
a
comprehensive
plan
to
reform
existing
immigration
law
would
be
an
exercise
in
futility
until
the
united
states
can
secure
its
border
with
mexico
i
think
securing
the
border
is
the
most
important
step
because
its
the
first
step
that
has
to
take
place
before
you
can
solve
any
other
issue
bishop
said
if
the
tub
is
overflowing
the
first
thing
you
do
is
turn
off
the
water
not
figure
out
where
to
put
the
water
theres
the
old
saying
by
lewis
carroll
that
paraphrasing
says
if
you
do
first
things
first
second
things
will
be
added
to
it
if
you
do
second
things
first
youll
accomplish
neither
first
nor
second
things
which
is
why
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
there
is
border
security
he
asserts
that
border
patrol
agents
are
severely
inhibited
from
protecting
the
border
by
archeological
laws
endangered
species
areas
and
historic
laws
that
exist
only
on
federal
lands
and
prohibit
border
agents
limitations
which
illegal
bordercrossers
knowingly
use
to
their
advantage
to
that
end
bishop
is
cosponsoring
house
bill
5016
which
would
free
border
patrol
agents
from
those
and
other
restrictions
border
patrol
does
a
great
job
on
private
property
where
by
law
they
have
total
access
to
meet
their
needs
he
said
its
only
on
federal
property
that
the
federal
border
patrol
is
prohibited
by
federal
land
managers
from
actually
being
able
to
do
their
jobs
and
thats
what
has
to
stop
the
true
believer
congress
has
totally
ignored
this
problem
and
its
a
shame
because
everyone
knows
its
broken
and
it
has
to
be
fixed
chaffetz
said
for
those
of
us
that
want
to
be
part
of
the
solution
its
terribly
frustrating
sitting
on
the
house
subcommittee
on
immigration
challenges
chaffetzs
patience
he
reached
a
bit
of
a
breaking
point
last
month
when
he
skipped
the
immigration
subcommittee
meeting
wherein
stephen
colbert
the
comedy
central
funny
man
who
chaffetz
once
legwrestled
on
the
colbert
report
television
show
appeared
before
the
subcommittee
to
offer
ostensibly
faux
testimony
about
immigration
issues
ive
been
on
the
immigration
subcommittee
for
21
months
and
before
stephen
colbert
the
subcommittee
had
only
met
10
times
he
said
never
did
we
actually
mark
up
a
substantive
immigration
bill
never
i
have
sponsored
or
cosponsored
12
pieces
of
immigration
legislation
and
yet
none
of
it
has
ever
come
up
before
the
subcommittee
thats
whats
frustrating
like
matheson
chaffetz
also
has
his
own
threepart
plan
enforce
current
laws
secure
the
border
and
rectify
a
broken
immigration
system
unlike
matheson
though
chaffez
blames
only
the
democrats
for
the
political
gridlock
keeping
immigration
reform
from
happening
democrats
dont
seem
to
have
time
for
worthwhile
bills
that
are
done
in
a
bipartisan
way
he
said
i
think
thats
why
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
is
about
to
get
fired
hopefully
if
leadership
changes
in
the
house
hopefully
that
will
change
in
the
immigration
subcommittee
as
well
