delegate
charles
jenkins
a
republican
who
as
county
commissioner
led
the
fight
for
strict
immigration
policy
pearce
said
he
is
not
familiar
with
the
other
candidate
in
the
race
i
know
michael
i
trust
michael
pearce
said
he
is
vigilant
in
defense
of
freedom
limited
government
and
the
rule
of
law
pearce
and
hough
crossed
paths
in
2007
when
hough
began
working
at
the
american
legislative
exchange
council
an
organization
that
works
with
conservative
state
legislators
around
the
country
the
organization
worked
with
pearce
on
creating
model
laws
that
would
require
people
getting
government
contracts
to
use
an
everify
program
the
group
also
worked
with
him
on
drafting
the
immigration
law
that
grabbed
headlines
earlier
this
year
hough
said
now
more
than
ever
we
need
legislators
like
michael
that
will
support
law
enforcement
and
support
efforts
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
and
put
america
and
americans
first
pearce
said
in
a
statement
both
hough
and
jenkins
have
pledged
to
sign
on
to
legislation
similar
to
the
arizona
law
in
the
maryland
general
assembly
but
jenkins
said
hough
has
been
strangely
absent
from
the
immigration
debate
in
frederick
county
now
all
of
the
sudden
hes
johnny
on
the
spot
with
an
endorsement
from
an
arizona
senator
jenkins
said
i
think
the
voters
would
like
to
know
where
he
was
when
i
proposed
my
first
three
pieces
of
legislation
dealing
with
illegal
immigration
as
commissioner
jenkins
brought
illegal
immigration
to
the
forefront
by
proposing
the
county
deny
services
to
those
who
couldnt
prove
they
were
in
the
country
legally
he
also
wanted
to
make
english
the
official
language
and
count
how
many
students
in
the
public
schools
could
not
prove
they
were
in
the
country
legally
he
followed
up
on
that
by
introducing
a
bill
in
the
general
assembly
that
would
have
required
the
state
division
of
parole
and
probation
to
forward
information
on
immigrant
inmates
to
the
us
immigration
customs
and
enforcement
agency
the
bill
did
not
pass
we
need
to
keep
raising
our
voice
because
if
we
dont
were
going
to
be
ignored
jenkins
said
hough
disputed
jenkins
characterization
that
he
had
been
absent
from
the
immigration
issue
hough
said
he
had
been
working
on
it
at
the
national
level
thats
why
sen
pearce
endorsed
me
because
we
have
a
great
working
relationship
from
years
of
working
on
this
issue
together
