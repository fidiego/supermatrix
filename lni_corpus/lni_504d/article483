with
a
huge
immigration
bill
pending
in
the
house
republicans
are
debating
whether
to
split
it
in
two
a
move
that
would
allow
proposals
intended
for
illegal
aliens
to
go
forward
while
making
action
on
legal
immigration
far
less
likely
anytime
soon
ten
california
republicans
including
some
of
the
most
conservative
house
members
have
urged
the
house
leadership
to
break
out
the
provisions
on
legal
immigration
in
the
letter
the
house
members
said
that
while
they
believed
in
the
need
to
revise
the
countrys
immigration
system
as
a
whole
they
also
believed
that
delays
in
passing
the
house
immigration
bill
were
attributable
to
the
legal
immigrations
provisions
of
this
legislation
resulting
in
the
further
delay
of
needed
efforts
to
stop
illegal
immigration
paul
mero
chief
of
staff
for
representative
robert
k
dornan
a
signer
of
the
letter
and
a
candidate
for
the
republican
presidential
nomination
said
illegal
immigration
is
such
an
important
issue
to
southern
california
you
tie
it
up
with
the
issue
of
legal
immigration
and
you
give
cover
to
the
democrats
to
beat
the
whole
bill
to
a
pulp
at
the
same
time
35
lawmakers
mostly
republicans
who
support
limits
on
legal
immigrants
were
circulating
another
letter
this
one
addressed
to
speaker
newt
gingrich
urging
him
to
keep
the
measure
intact
they
included
representatives
bill
archer
of
texas
chairman
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
gerald
b
h
solomon
of
upstate
new
york
chairman
of
the
house
rules
committee
and
floyd
d
spence
of
south
carolina
chairman
of
the
committee
on
national
security
an
aide
to
representative
bob
stump
the
arizona
republican
who
circulated
the
letter
declined
to
provide
details
saying
that
it
had
not
yet
been
sent
to
mr
gingrich
a
georgia
republican
the
immigration
bill
that
was
approved
last
month
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
reduces
over
a
fiveyear
period
the
amount
of
legal
immigration
to
no
more
than
535000
people
annually
down
from
the
current
level
of
about
800000
a
year
it
also
seeks
to
curb
illegal
immigration
mainly
by
setting
up
a
system
where
employers
will
verify
the
legal
status
of
all
newly
hired
employees
through
a
federal
databank
opponents
of
reducing
legal
immigration
hope
to
remove
the
question
from
the
politically
powerful
appeal
of
stopping
illegal
immigration
the
letter
proposing
the
split
was
circulated
by
representative
jay
c
kim
of
california
the
only
koreanamerican
member
of
congress
and
a
lawmaker
born
in
seoul
signers
included
representatives
david
dreir
frank
riggs
and
dana
rohrabacher
all
republicans
the
fact
that
the
letter
was
signed
by
10
members
from
california
a
state
where
immigration
has
become
a
contentious
political
issue
is
indicative
of
the
conflicting
currents
that
wash
through
the
republican
party
when
it
comes
to
immigration
while
a
majority
of
congressional
republicans
support
reducing
the
level
of
legal
immigration
others
more
free
marketoriented
republicans
like
representative
dick
armey
the
house
majority
leader
the
former
education
secretary
william
bennett
and
the
former
housing
secretary
jack
f
kemp
all
favor
high
levels
of
legal
immigration
