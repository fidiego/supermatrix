there
is
a
sense
in
which
current
immigration
policy
is
adolf
hitlers
posthumous
revenge
on
america
the
us
political
elite
emerged
from
the
war
passionately
concerned
to
cleanse
itself
from
all
taints
of
racism
or
xenophobia
eventually
it
enacted
the
epochal
immigration
act
technically
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
amendments
of
1965
and
this
quite
accidentally
triggered
a
renewed
mass
immigration
so
huge
and
so
systematically
different
from
anything
that
had
gone
before
as
to
transform
and
ultimately
perhaps
even
to
destroy
the
one
unquestioned
victor
of
world
war
ii
the
american
nation
as
it
had
evolved
by
the
middle
of
the
20th
century
today
us
government
policy
is
literally
dissolving
the
people
and
electing
a
new
one
you
can
be
for
this
or
you
can
be
against
it
but
the
fact
is
undeniable
still
time
magazine
wrote
in
its
fall
1993
special
issue
on
multiculturalism
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
us
has
an
immigration
policy
that
for
better
or
worse
is
truly
democratic
as
an
immigrant
albeit
one
who
came
here
rather
earlier
than
yesterday
and
is
now
an
american
citizen
i
find
myself
asking
with
fascination
what
can
this
possibly
mean
american
immigration
policy
has
always
been
democratic
of
course
in
the
sense
that
it
has
been
made
through
democratic
procedures
right
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
unusually
undemocratic
in
the
sense
that
americans
have
told
pollsters
long
and
loudly
that
they
dont
want
any
more
immigration
but
the
politicians
ignore
them
the
mass
immigration
so
thoughtlessly
triggered
in
1965
risks
making
america
an
alien
nation
not
merely
in
the
sense
that
the
numbers
of
aliens
in
the
nation
are
rising
to
levels
last
seen
in
the
19th
century
not
merely
in
the
sense
that
america
will
become
a
freak
among
the
worlds
nations
because
of
the
unprecedented
demographic
mutation
it
is
inflicting
on
itself
not
merely
in
the
sense
that
americans
themselves
will
become
alien
to
each
other
requiring
an
increasingly
strained
government
to
arbitrate
between
them
but
ultimately
in
the
sense
that
americans
will
no
longer
share
in
common
what
abraham
lincoln
called
in
his
first
inaugural
address
the
mystic
chords
of
memory
stretching
from
every
battlefield
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
hearth
stone
all
over
this
broad
land
and
that
when
the
time
comes
to
strike
those
chords
no
sweet
sound
will
result
my
son
is
born
alexander
james
frank
brimelow
is
an
american
although
i
was
still
a
british
subject
and
his
mother
a
canadian
when
he
shot
into
the
new
york
hospital
delivery
room
yelling
indignantly
one
summer
dawn
in
1991
this
is
because
of
the
14th
amendment
to
the
us
constitution
it
states
in
part
all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
wherein
they
reside
the
14th
amendment
was
passed
after
the
civil
war
in
an
attempt
to
stop
southern
states
denying
their
newly
freed
slaves
the
full
rights
of
citizens
but
the
wording
is
general
so
it
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
any
child
born
in
the
united
states
is
automatically
a
citizen
even
if
its
mother
is
a
foreigner
even
if
shes
just
passing
through
i
am
delighted
that
alexander
is
an
american
however
i
do
feel
slightly
well
guilty
that
his
fellow
americans
had
so
little
choice
in
the
matter
but
at
least
maggy
and
i
had
applied
for
and
been
granted
legal
permission
to
live
in
the
united
states
there
are
currently
an
estimated
35
to
4
million
foreigners
who
have
just
arrived
and
settled
here
in
defiance
of
american
law
when
these
illegal
immigrants
have
children
in
the
united
states
why
those
children
are
automatically
american
citizens
too
and
right
now
twothirds
of
the
births
in
los
angeles
county
hospitals
are
to
illegalimmigrant
mothers
all
of
which
is
just
another
example
of
one
of
my
central
themes
the
united
states
has
lost
control
of
its
borders
in
every
sense
a
series
of
institutional
accidents
of
which
birthright
citizenship
is
just
one
has
essentially
robbed
americans
of
the
power
to
determine
who
and
how
many
can
enter
their
national
family
make
claims
on
it
and
exert
power
over
it
the
heart
of
the
problem
immigration
in
1991
the
year
of
alexanders
birth
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
reported
a
total
of
over
18
million
legal
immigrants
that
was
easily
a
record
it
exceeded
by
almost
a
third
the
previous
peak
of
almost
13
million
reached
84
years
earlier
at
the
height
of
the
first
great
wave
of
immigration
which
peaked
just
after
the
turn
of
the
century
the
united
states
has
been
engulfed
by
what
seems
likely
to
be
the
greatest
wave
of
immigration
it
has
ever
faced
the
ins
estimates
that
12
million
to
13
million
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
will
enter
the
united
states
during
the
1990s
the
washington
dcbased
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
among
the
most
prominent
of
the
groups
critical
of
immigration
policy
thinks
the
total
will
range
between
10
million
and
15
million
an
independent
expert
daniel
james
author
of
illegal
immigration
an
unfolding
crisis
has
argued
that
it
could
be
as
high
as
18
million
its
not
just
illegal
immigration
that
is
out
of
control
so
is
legal
immigration
us
iaw
in
effect
treats
immigration
as
a
sort
of
imitation
civil
right
extended
to
an
indefinite
group
of
foreigners
who
have
been
selected
arbitrarily
and
with
no
regard
to
american
interests
the
american
immigration
debate
has
been
a
oneway
street
criticism
of
immigration
and
news
that
might
support
it
just
tends
not
to
get
through
for
example
the
united
states
is
in
the
midst
of
a
serious
crime
epidemic
yet
almost
no
americans
are
aware
that
aliens
make
up
one
quarter
of
the
prisoners
in
federal
penitentiaries
almost
three
times
their
proportion
in
the
population
at
large
indeed
many
problems
that
currently
preoccupy
americans
have
an
unspoken
immigration
dimension
two
further
instances
the
healthcare
crisis
americans
have
been
told
repeatedly
that
some
30
million
to
40
million
people
in
the
country
have
no
health
insurance
at
any
one
point
in
time
typically
nobody
seems
to
know
how
many
are
immigrants
but
immigrants
certainly
make
up
a
disproportionate
share
particularly
of
the
real
problem
the
much
smaller
hard
core
perhaps
6
million
that
remains
uninsured
after
two
years
we
know
that
about
6
million
of
the
22
million
us
hispanics
are
uninsured
at
any
one
point
since
almost
a
third
of
us
hispanics
are
foreignborn
its
obvious
that
immigrants
and
their
children
must
be
some
and
perhaps
most
of
them
the
hard
core
of
uninsured
experts
confirm
is
substantially
hispanic
that
probably
includes
many
of
the
estimated
nearly
2
million
uninsured
illegal
immigrants
permanently
settled
here
a
heavily
hispanic
group
the
education
crisis
americans
are
used
to
hearing
that
their
schools
dont
seem
to
be
providing
the
quality
of
education
that
foreigners
get
fewer
of
them
know
that
the
us
education
system
is
also
very
expensive
by
international
standards
virtually
none
of
them
know
anything
about
the
impact
of
immigration
on
that
education
system
yet
the
impact
of
immigration
is
clearly
serious
for
example
in
1990
almost
one
child
in
every
20
enrolled
in
american
public
schools
either
could
not
speak
english
or
spoke
it
so
poorly
as
to
need
language
assistance
programs
this
number
is
increasing
with
striking
speed
only
six
years
earlier
it
had
been
one
child
in
31
current
law
is
generally
interpreted
as
requiring
schools
to
educate
such
children
in
their
native
language
to
do
so
according
to
one
california
estimate
requires
spending
some
65
percent
more
per
child
than
on
an
englishspeaking
child
and
not
merely
money
but
more
importantly
teacher
time
and
energy
are
inevitably
being
diverted
from
americas
children
my
thesis
is
that
the
immigration
resulting
from
current
public
policy
1
is
dramatically
larger
less
skilled
and
more
divergent
from
the
american
majority
than
anything
that
was
anticipated
or
desired
2
is
probably
not
beneficial
economically
and
is
certainly
not
necessary
3
is
attended
by
a
wide
and
increasing
range
of
negative
consequences
from
the
physical
environment
to
the
political
4
is
bringing
about
an
ethnic
and
racial
transformation
in
america
without
precedent
in
the
history
of
the
world
an
astonishing
social
experiment
launched
with
no
particular
reason
to
expect
success
some
of
my
american
readers
will
be
stirring
uneasily
at
this
point
they
have
been
trained
to
recoil
from
any
explicit
discussion
of
race
and
anyone
who
says
anything
critical
of
immigration
is
going
to
be
accused
of
racism
because
the
term
racist
is
now
so
debased
i
usually
shrug
off
such
smears
by
pointing
to
its
new
definition
anyone
who
is
winning
an
argument
with
a
liberal
or
too
often
a
libertarian
and
on
the
immigration
issue
even
some
confused
conservatives
this
may
sound
facetious
but
the
double
standards
are
irritating
anyone
who
has
got
into
an
immigration
debate
with
for
example
hispanic
activists
must
be
instantly
aware
that
some
of
them
really
are
consumed
by
the
most
intense
racial
animosity
directed
against
whites
how
come
whats
sauce
for
the
goose
is
not
sauce
for
the
gander
i
have
indeed
duly
examined
my
own
motives
and
i
am
happy
to
report
that
they
are
pure
i
sincerely
believe
i
am
not
prejudiced
in
the
sense
of
committing
and
stubbornly
persisting
in
error
about
people
regardless
of
evidence
which
appears
to
me
to
be
the
only
rational
definition
of
racism
i
am
also
however
not
blind
race
and
ethnicity
are
destiny
in
american
politics
and
because
of
the
rise
of
affirmative
action
quotas
for
american
individuals
too
my
son
alexander
is
a
white
male
with
blue
eyes
and
blond
hair
he
has
never
discriminated
against
anyone
in
his
little
life
except
possibly
young
women
visitors
whom
he
suspects
of
being
babysitters
but
public
policy
now
discriminates
against
him
the
sheer
size
of
the
so
called
protected
classes
that
are
now
politically
favored
such
as
hispanics
will
be
a
matter
of
vital
importance
as
long
as
he
lives
and
their
size
is
basically
determined
by
immigration
for
americans
even
to
think
about
their
immigration
policy
given
the
political
climate
that
has
prevailed
since
the
1960s
involves
a
sort
of
psychological
liberation
movement
in
eugene
mccarthys
terms
america
would
have
to
stop
being
a
colony
of
the
world
the
implications
are
shocking
even
frightening
that
americans
without
feeling
guilty
can
and
should
seize
control
of
their
countrys
destiny
if
they
did
what
would
a
decolonized
american
immigration
policy
look
like
the
first
step
is
absolutely
clear
the
1965
immigration
act
and
its
amplifications
in
1986
and
1990
have
been
a
disaster
and
must
be
repealed
it
may
be
time
for
the
united
states
to
consider
moving
to
a
conception
of
itself
more
like
that
of
switzerland
tolerating
a
fairly
large
foreign
presence
that
comes
and
goes
but
rarely
if
ever
naturalizes
it
may
be
time
to
consider
reviving
a
version
of
the
bracero
program
the
agricultural
guestworkers
program
that
operated
from
the
1940s
to
the
1960s
allowing
foreign
workers
to
move
in
and
out
of
the
country
in
a
controlled
way
without
permanently
altering
its
demography
and
politics
this
new
conception
may
be
a
shock
to
american
sensibilities
many
americans
like
my
students
at
the
university
of
cincinnati
law
school
are
under
the
charming
impression
that
foreigners
dont
really
exist
but
they
also
tend
to
think
that
if
foreigners
really
do
exist
they
ought
to
become
americans
as
quickly
as
possible
however
the
fact
is
that
we
foreigners
are
in
some
sense
all
americans
now
just
as
jefferson
said
everyone
had
two
countries
his
own
and
france
in
the
18th
century
that
is
why
we
are
here
just
as
the
entire
world
flocked
to
imperial
rome
the
trick
the
americans
face
now
is
to
be
an
empire
in
fact
while
remaining
a
democratic
republic
in
spirit
avoiding
the
romans
mistake
of
diluting
their
citizenship
into
insignificance
may
be
the
key
