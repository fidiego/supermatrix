two
key
house
republicans
plan
to
push
ahead
on
immigration
reform
by
focusing
on
a
few
specific
bills
keeping
the
issue
before
the
chamber
widely
expected
to
have
the
hardest
time
with
immigration
reform
legislation
even
as
the
senates
sweeping
bipartisan
bill
speeds
toward
the
finish
line
whatever
their
differences
in
style
and
substance
though
immigration
players
in
both
senate
and
house
expressed
confidence
thursday
of
approving
some
kind
of
reform
before
the
year
is
out
we
do
have
a
broken
immigration
system
and
the
house
does
intend
to
play
a
leading
role
in
making
sure
this
is
solved
said
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
bob
goodlatte
r
of
virginia
whose
panel
oversees
immigration
law
mr
goodlatte
and
rep
trey
gowdy
r
of
south
carolina
who
chairs
the
house
subcommittee
charged
specifically
with
immigration
policy
are
starting
with
smaller
pieces
of
the
immigration
puzzle
rather
than
one
overarching
bill
they
say
their
committees
members
will
introduce
two
standalone
measures
one
on
foreign
agricultural
workers
and
one
to
make
mandatory
an
employee
verification
system
known
as
everify
as
a
first
stab
at
immigration
reform
that
dripdripdrip
approach
contrasts
markedly
with
action
in
the
senate
where
two
leaders
on
immigration
reform
on
thursday
offered
the
hope
that
their
sweeping
measure
could
win
significant
bipartisan
support
sens
charles
schumer
d
of
new
york
and
john
mccain
r
of
arizona
argued
that
it
is
very
possible
majorities
of
senators
in
both
parties
could
support
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
solution
leading
to
a
final
tally
of
ayes
north
of
70
in
that
chamber
a
bipartisan
gang
of
eight
senators
unveiled
a
comprehensive
reform
bill
last
week
and
it
has
already
had
three
hearings
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
sen
pat
leahy
d
of
vermont
the
panels
chairman
started
the
bill
toward
the
senate
floor
on
thursday
by
scheduling
time
to
amend
it
in
early
may
when
congress
returns
from
a
district
work
week
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
d
of
nevada
says
the
bill
could
hit
the
senate
floor
for
further
debate
and
amendment
in
june
at
a
breakfast
with
reporters
sponsored
by
the
christian
science
monitor
senators
mccain
and
schumer
said
they
had
taken
care
to
anticipate
the
needs
of
their
gop
colleagues
stripping
from
the
bill
a
diversity
visa
program
that
conservatives
dislike
and
ensuring
that
interests
of
southern
farmers
are
accommodated
if
we
were
to
pass
this
bill
with
say
over
50
democratic
votes
but
only
eight
or
nine
republican
votes
it
would
pass
we
would
get
to
60
but
it
would
bode
poorly
for
the
reform
effort
in
the
house
schumer
said
the
bills
supporters
want
a
bold
bipartisan
senate
vote
that
will
jolt
the
house
which
has
been
pursuing
a
more
deliberative
tack
on
immigration
reform
the
houses
goslow
approach
is
intended
to
help
educate
members
from
districts
with
tiny
minority
populations
who
have
never
handled
immigration
issues
as
well
as
to
fulfill
the
promises
of
republican
house
leaders
that
more
bills
will
follow
the
standard
legislative
process
by
which
more
lawmakers
have
opportunities
to
contribute
the
houses
path
has
its
critics
of
course
who
predict
that
the
reform
effort
will
be
foiled
if
it
is
diverted
from
a
comprehensive
track
rep
goodlatte
knows
full
well
theres
a
broad
bipartisan
bill
that
is
likely
to
pass
the
senate
and
a
broad
bipartisan
bill
that
is
about
to
be
introduced
in
the
house
rather
than
truly
supporting
these
measures
he
is
introducing
partisan
piecemeal
measures
that
went
nowhere
in
the
last
congress
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
americas
voice
in
a
statement
on
thursday
goodlattes
announcement
makes
it
easier
for
opponents
of
broad
reform
to
oppose
comprehensive
reform
while
claiming
they
support
something
mr
sharry
continued
goodlatte
repeatedly
emphasized
on
thursday
that
his
committee
is
open
to
an
eventual
product
from
the
houses
bipartisan
immigration
negotiating
group
the
senates
eventual
product
or
somewhere
else
and
he
underlines
the
goal
is
not
to
kill
the
immigration
reform
effort
were
certainly
not
doing
that
goodlatte
says
we
have
been
working
very
hard
on
this
and
we
respect
the
effort
of
others
but
we
encourage
all
of
them
to
be
careful
examine
the
legislation
very
closely
understand
how
each
component
of
immigration
relates
to
every
other
component
so
we
dont
get
the
law
of
unintended
consequences
taking
hold
in
this
matter
so
why
go
ahead
with
small
pieces
of
reform
knowing
that
doing
so
raises
the
ire
of
immigration
reformers
goodlatte
says
more
than
100
house
republicans
have
attended
gop
education
sessions
on
immigration
but
that
represents
less
than
half
the
gop
conference
by
introducing
pieces
of
the
immigration
puzzle
one
at
a
time
goodlatte
and
mr
gowdy
believe
they
can
drill
down
on
the
specifics
of
each
portion
of
the
immigration
system
so
that
their
members
understand
the
stakes
and
potential
solutions
of
each
one
the
immigration
education
sessions
have
been
as
wellattended
as
the
information
sessions
hosted
by
house
budget
committee
chairman
paul
ryan
during
the
debt
ceiling
fight
of
2011
but
some
members
are
on
the
sidelines
gowdy
saysintroducing
specific
bills
goodlatte
says
will
underscore
the
house
majoritys
seriousness
about
taking
on
immigration
reform
and
will
encourage
more
members
to
become
engaged
our
function
in
moving
legislation
into
the
committee
so
we
can
look
at
it
and
hold
legislative
hearings
on
it
is
that
doing
so
will
be
a
wakeup
call
to
those
who
havent
done
it
to
say
hey
you
better
come
down
and
start
looking
seriously
at
what
were
doing
on
immigration
he
says
in
other
words
the
house
whose
bipartisan
immigration
reform
group
has
yet
to
produce
a
bill
needs
to
keep
moving
and
it
must
keep
moving
keep
educating
keep
the
debate
flowing
because
of
members
like
representative
gowdy
gowdy
a
former
prosecutor
elected
during
the
tea
party
wave
of
2010
who
has
a
flair
for
giving
booming
emotional
speeches
on
the
house
floor
noted
that
hispanics
make
up
less
than
2
percent
of
the
citizens
in
his
district
in
the
palmetto
state
as
such
his
own
constituents
are
not
exactly
pushing
for
him
to
take
up
immigration
reform
but
gowdy
says
they
might
appreciate
a
policy
fix
that
actually
solves
americas
longrunning
immigration
problem
this
is
not
a
political
exercise
to
me
says
gowdy
which
is
why
i
appreciate
so
much
the
approach
the
chairman
goodlatte
is
taking
i
would
like
a
remedy
that
sustains
us
for
the
remainder
of
my
lifetime
so
im
much
more
interested
in
a
process
that
is
confidenceinspiring
than
a
political
remedy
