your
tired
your
poor
your
huddled
masses
yearning
to
breathe
free
it
now
seems
that
more
than
anything
else
the
freedom
of
migration
is
again
a
meaningful
facet
as
resolutions
are
turning
a
new
tide
towards
immigration
reform
in
washington
although
the
senate
has
already
passed
a
broad
overhaul
of
the
immigration
laws
including
a
path
to
citizenship
for
the
more
than
11
million
illegal
immigrants
the
legislation
still
continues
to
be
mired
with
obstacles
in
the
republicancontrolled
house
of
representatives
but
whether
or
not
house
republicans
piecemeal
approach
to
immigration
reform
will
favour
the
democrats
comprehensive
hard
line
process
us
chamber
of
commerce
president
tom
donohue
confirms
that
we
are
determined
to
make
2014
the
year
that
immigration
reform
is
finally
enacted
immigration
reform
is
an
important
part
of
expanding
jobs
and
careers
in
the
21st
century
compounded
to
this
is
the
economist
notion
that
immigration
reform
will
grow
the
economy
by
14
trillion
and
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
a
trillion
dollars
nonetheless
republicans
insistence
on
not
signing
off
on
any
measure
that
calls
on
granting
a
pathway
for
legalization
or
rewarding
lawbreakers
still
prevails
and
while
proponents
further
emphasize
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
will
help
to
fortify
americas
global
competiveness
stimulate
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
safeguard
national
security
and
strengthen
the
economy
house
republicans
are
now
determined
to
reform
actions
by
laying
out
a
set
of
principles
on
how
to
overhaul
immigration
legislation
and
helping
the
bill
pass
through
the
house
of
representatives
but
it
seems
that
chimerical
hopes
are
fastly
fading
despite
the
fact
that
the
principles
seek
the
need
for
tougher
border
control
and
interior
security
so
that
companies
cannot
easily
hire
undocumented
workers
the
more
challenging
question
of
the
more
than
11
million
illegal
immigrants
still
remain
unanswered
and
it
is
within
this
light
that
vice
president
for
immigration
policy
at
the
progressive
center
for
american
progress
angela
kelly
stresses
that
if
the
principles
are
just
a
political
tactic
by
republicans
ahead
of
the
midterms
elections
in
november
then
latino
voters
will
see
right
through
it
still
others
fear
that
the
principles
are
just
a
republican
means
of
avoiding
criticism
for
doing
nothing
at
all
on
immigration
reform
in
an
election
year
where
there
are
mounting
pressures
from
outside
groups
and
many
contend
that
immigration
reform
should
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
change
as
a
result
the
hispanic
vote
still
clouds
the
dust
for
answers
and
must
be
addressed
not
only
by
house
republicans
but
also
by
congressional
republicans
who
are
also
grappling
on
how
to
handle
the
specter
of
immigration
the
hispanic
vote
is
important
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
electorate
but
also
for
economic
and
moral
reasons
as
well
therefore
republicans
must
cooperate
they
dont
have
a
choice
on
the
other
hand
when
viewed
through
the
prism
of
humanitarianism
and
morality
immigration
reform
transgresses
the
grain
of
americas
cherished
ideals
and
principles
and
demoralizes
its
obligation
to
democratic
and
compassionate
values
in
a
country
that
boasts
of
human
rights
respect
and
freedom
for
all
immigration
reform
tears
through
the
sacred
veil
of
families
and
renders
it
to
pieces
sexual
exploitation
of
illegal
workers
and
the
threat
of
deportation
that
are
now
brutalizing
immigrant
communities
cannot
continue
to
go
by
unnoticed
according
to
research
the
united
states
imprisons
more
than
430000
illegal
immigrants
each
year
hundreds
more
are
held
in
inexplicably
solitary
confinement
thus
portraying
us
immigration
as
an
inhumane
and
insensitive
system
where
the
huddled
masses
are
yearning
for
salvation
forthwith
it
must
now
be
understood
that
the
huddled
masses
are
a
tangible
reality
that
cannot
forever
remain
masked
in
abstraction
and
swept
away
in
the
dustbins
of
history
their
traumatized
lives
broken
dreams
fears
pain
and
even
death
have
now
been
molded
into
one
they
yearn
to
breathe
the
breath
of
freedom
it
is
now
time
to
change
the
narrative
lo
i
lift
my
lamp
beside
the
golden
door
