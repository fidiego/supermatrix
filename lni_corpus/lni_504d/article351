the
vancouver
sun
published
an
article
recently
that
stated
canada
must
dramatically
boost
immigration
to
counter
the
social
and
economic
impact
of
an
aging
population
according
to
a
new
report
by
statistics
canada
the
statistics
canada
study
in
fact
said
only
that
because
of
low
fertility
levels
the
population
would
start
to
decline
in
several
decades
if
not
offset
by
high
immigration
it
said
nothing
about
immigration
helping
to
solve
the
social
and
economic
impact
of
aging
as
stated
in
the
suns
report
even
at
that
the
wording
of
the
study
was
misleading
in
that
it
did
not
indicate
what
was
meant
by
high
immigration
most
studies
on
the
subject
suggest
that
considerably
lower
levels
of
net
immigration
than
at
present
would
be
sufficient
to
maintain
reasonable
population
levels
the
distinction
between
immigration
helping
to
solve
the
problem
of
a
declining
population
and
immigration
providing
a
solution
to
the
problems
of
an
aging
population
and
an
worsening
dependency
ratio
ie
fewer
workers
per
retirees
is
an
important
one
since
efforts
are
made
from
time
to
time
to
justify
high
immigration
levels
by
claiming
that
they
are
necessary
to
offset
the
aging
and
dependency
problems
the
fact
is
that
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
that
immigration
cannot
provide
a
solution
the
most
comprehensive
examination
of
these
issues
to
date
was
presented
in
the
demographic
review
issued
by
the
department
of
health
and
welfare
in
1989
which
showed
that
increased
immigration
would
have
very
little
impact
on
population
aging
unless
undertaken
on
a
truly
massive
scale
the
department
of
citizenship
and
immigration
confirmed
this
conclusion
in
a
paper
on
immigration
and
canadian
demographics
in
1998
and
in
the
same
year
statistics
canada
in
its
annual
report
on
the
demographic
situation
in
canada
stated
that
immigration
is
a
dangerous
method
of
curbing
aging
immigration
cannot
erase
the
dilemma
of
growing
old
which
the
entire
population
must
face
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
immigration
can
solve
the
population
aging
problem
was
spelled
out
in
detail
last
year
in
a
united
nations
study
which
showed
that
the
number
of
immigrants
needed
to
maintain
current
age
levels
would
be
overwhelming
while
canada
was
not
one
of
the
countries
covered
in
the
study
the
united
states
with
an
age
profile
very
close
to
ours
was
included
in
the
case
of
the
us
enough
immigrants
would
have
to
be
brought
in
to
quadruple
the
population
in
the
coming
50
years
the
problem
does
not
even
end
there
however
since
immigrants
take
on
the
same
aging
and
familysize
characteristics
as
other
north
americans
after
a
generation
or
two
the
population
would
continue
to
find
itself
aging
and
it
would
again
be
necessary
to
quadruple
the
population
in
the
following
50
years
in
the
case
of
canada
this
would
mean
we
would
have
to
have
almost
half
a
billion
people
on
our
soil
by
the
end
of
the
century
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
problems
associated
with
an
aging
population
do
not
have
to
be
addressed
by
one
means
or
another
what
is
clear
is
that
immigration
does
not
provide
a
solution
despite
this
the
minister
of
immigration
and
various
immigration
advocacy
groups
continue
to
use
demographic
arguments
in
an
effort
to
justify
high
immigration
levels
