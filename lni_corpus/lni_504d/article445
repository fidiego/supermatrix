calling

after

in

at
the
nations
capital
salt
lake
city
diocese
bishop
john
wester
presided
over
a
prayer
at
the
rally
and
said
the
issue
is
a
human
and
moral
one
there
are
just
so
many
people
affected
by
our
broken
immigration
system
proper
reform
would
blend
enforcement
policy
with
generosity
toward
people
that
would
allow
them
to
gain
an
immigration
status
a
way
toward
citizenship
and
keep
families
together
wester
said
in
salt
lake
city
the
sea
of
people
stretching
roughly
five
blocks
on
state
street
carried
us
flags
and
chanted
in
english
and
spanish
alternating
from
si
se
puede
to
yes
we
can
and
obama
listen
we
are
in
the
struggle
they
held
homemade
signs
in
both
languages
stating
family
values
immigration
reform
protect
our
families
we
are
all
immigrants
and
we
work
hard
we
pay
taxes
we
pay
into
ss
social
security
we
contribute
too
countless
signs
and
speakers
emphasized
that
undocumented
immigrants
contribute
to
their
communities
through
sales
property
and
other
taxes
and
so
they
should
be
able
to
work
and
live
without
fear
said
marisa
medina
while
keeping
an
eye
on
her
son
who
ran
on
the
grass
waving
an
us
flag
maria
olague
marched
with
her
husband
miguel
who
draped
himself
in
the
us
flag
and
said
many
people
only
see
undocumented
workers
as
criminals
when
really
they
are
people
of
peace
and
hard
workers
after
seeing
many
friends
families
broken
apart
when
parents
are
deported
and
their
usborn
children
stay
behind
susana
wilson
wants
citizenship
or
visas
to
be
accessible
to
more
people
they
need
that
card
so
they
can
work
legally
cause
we
have
a
lot
of
good
people
they
just
want
to
work
wilson
said
adding
she
had
it
easy
when
she
gained
us
citizenship
through
her
marriage
while
the
fight
for
immigration
reform
is
long
utah
state
rep
rebecca
chavezhouck
dsalt

city
told
people
to
stay
strong
dont
get
discouraged
you
are
the
new
pioneers
of
utah
and
you
must
be
heard
she
said
in
sentiment
that
many
would
later
echo
as
they
compared
the
struggles
of
undocumented
workers
to
early
mormons
being
persecuted
or
blacks
amidst
segregation
as
marchers
neared
the
capitol
they
were
met
with
thumbs
down
and
signs
from
an
informal
group
of
less
than
a
dozen
counterprotesters
jamin
merton
stood
at
the
base
of
the
capitol
steps
holding
the
us
flag
and
a
sign
reading
this
is
our
flag
we
are
here
legally
the
west
valley
city
resident
said
his
ancestors
were
legal
immigrants
but
other
people
are
shortcircuiting
the
system
theyre
demanding
that
we
give
them
citizenship
in
defiance
of
our
law
our
constitution
our
policemen
everything
that
we
stand
up
for
he
said
adding
the
only
type
of
immigration
reform
he
thinks
is
needed
is
one
that
focuses
on
protecting
borders
and
he
opposes
amnesty
and
other
pathtowardcitizenship
programs
but
march
organizer
jose
gutierrez
wants
reform
that
will
help
those
already
here
who
meet
certain
criteria
reach
citizenship
reunite
families
more
quickly
and
produce
a
visa
program
that
respects
workers
of
all
skill
levels
the
problem
with
immigration
isnt
bad
people
gutierrez
told
the
marchers
its
