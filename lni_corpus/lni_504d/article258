asylum
seekers
in
the
united
states
face
broad
disparities
in
the
nations
54
immigration
courts
with
the
outcome
of
cases
influenced
by
things
like
the
location
of
the
court
and
the
sex
and
professional
background
of
judges
a
new
study
has
found
the
study
by
three
law
professors
analyzes
140000
decisions
by
immigration
judges
including
those
cases
from
the
15
countries
that
have
produced
the
most
asylum
seekers
in
recent
years
among
them
china
haiti
colombia
albania
and
russia
the
professors
compared
for
the
first
time
the
results
of
immigration
court
cases
over
more
than
four
years
finding
vast
differences
in
the
handling
of
claims
with
generally
comparable
factual
circumstances
in
one
of
the
starker
examples
cited
colombians
had
an
88
percent
chance
of
winning
asylum
from
one
judge
in
the
miami
immigration
court
and
a
5
percent
chance
from
another
judge
in
the
same
court
it
is
very
disturbing
that
these
decisions
can
mean
life
or
death
and
they
seem
to
a
large
extent
to
be
the
result
of
a
clerks
random
assignment
of
a
case
to
a
particular
judge
said
an
author
of
the
study
philip
g
schrag
a
professor
at
georgetown
university
law
center
the
study
offers
an
unusually
detailed
window
into
the
overburdened
and
often
erratic
immigration
courts
though
the
immigration
bill
now
being
considered
does
not
propose
major
revisions
in
asylum
laws
those
courts
serve
as
the
judicial
backbone
of
the
immigration
system
that
would
take
on
an
immense
new
workload
if
the
bill
becomes
law
the
legislation
would
offer
a
road
to
legal
status
to
an
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
eliminate
backlogs
of
legal
immigration
cases
and
step
up
enforcement
among
other
measures
experts
predict
countless
legal
snags
that
would
land
before
the
immigration
judges
officials
at
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
of
the
department
of
justice
which
oversees
the
immigration
courts
declined
to
allow
interviews
about
the
study
with
david
l
neal
the
chief
immigration
judge
citing
a
policy
that
immigration
judges
do
not
speak
with
the
news
media
about
their
rulings
the
study
found
that
someone
who
has
fled
china
in
fear
of
persecution
and
asks
for
asylum
in
immigration
court
in
orlando
fla
has
an
excellent
76
percent
chance
of
success
while
the
same
refugee
would
have
a
7
percent
chance
in
atlanta
similarly
a
haitian
seeking
refuge
from
political
violence
is
almost
twice
as
likely
to
succeed
in
new
york
as
in
miami
immigration
lawyers
acknowledge
that
the
judges
have
difficult
work
with
huge
dockets
of
cases
that
must
be
decided
speedily
on
the
basis
of
scant
or
subjective
information
often
the
asylum
seeker
is
the
only
witness
to
crucial
events
but
because
immigration
law
is
federal
the
studys
authors
argued
some
uniformity
could
be
expected
in
judges
asylum
rulings
across
the
country
particularly
in
cases
of
people
fleeing
a
country
like
china
or
colombia
where
the
conditions
of
political
oppression
or
civil
violence
are
publicly
known
its
such
a
highvolume
system
where
the
participants
have
so
little
time
to
test
cases
and
make
decisions
you
become
much
more
subject
to
the
general
viewpoint
of
the
judge
said
bo
cooper
a
lawyer
at
paul
hastings
janofsky
walker
who
is
a
former
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
has
created
a
risk
mr
cooper
said
that
the
system
will
not
be
good
enough
at
providing
refuge
to
those
in
need
or
identifying
the
claims
of
those
who
are
not
in
need
the
wide
discretion
exercised
by
immigration
judges
can
be
disheartening
to
lawyers
and
disastrous
for
immigrants
facing
threats
to
their
lives
if
they
are
forced
to
return
home
immigration
lawyers
said
oftentimes
its
just
the
luck
of
the
draw
said
cheryl
little
a
lawyer
and
executive
director
of
the
florida
immigrant
advocacy
center
a
legal
assistance
group
in
miami
that
represents
many
asylum
seekers
its
heartbreaking
ms
little
said
how
do
you
explain
to
people
asking
for
refuge
that
even
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
cant
assure
them
they
will
receive
due
process
and
justice
while
immigration
officers
at
citizenship
and
immigration
services
the
federal
agency
can
grant
asylum
the
majority
of
asylum
cases
are
decided
by
the
immigration
judges
under
the
immigration
system
refugees
are
foreigners
coming
from
abroad
who
win
residency
in
the
united
states
for
protection
from
religious
persecution
or
political
threats
asylum
is
granted
to
foreigners
who
apply
for
refuge
when
they
are
already
in
the
united
states
the
study
is
based
on
data
on
judges
decisions
from
january
2000
through
august
2004
it
will
be
posted
today
on
the
web
site
of
the
social
science
research
network
wwwssrncom
and
published
in
november
in
the
stanford
law
review
in
addition
to
professor
schrag
the
authors
are
andrew
i
schoenholtz
also
a
professor
at
georgetown
university
law
center
and
jaya
ramjinogales
a
professor
at
beasley
school
of
law
at
temple
university
according
to
the
study
great
differences
also
prevail
among
judges
sitting
on
the
same
court
and
hearing
similar
asylum
cases
in
the
miami
immigration
court
one
judge
granted
3
percent
of
the
asylum
cases
while
another
granted
75
percent
one
of
the
most
significant
factors
determining
whether
a
judge
would
be
likely
to
approve
asylum
petitions
was
sex
the
study
found
female
immigration
judges
grant
asylum
at
a
44
percent
higher
rate
than
their
male
colleagues
the
study
by
the
three
professors
did
not
examine
the
judges
political
affiliation
or
the
administration
that
appointed
them
the
study
suggests
that
the
different
willingness
to
grant
asylum
between
male
and
female
judges
may
in
part
have
to
do
with
their
backgrounds
of
78
female
judges
in
the
study
27
percent
had
previously
worked
for
organizations
that
defended
the
rights
of
immigrants
or
the
poor
while
only
8
percent
of
169
male
judges
had
similar
experience
though
the
study
does
not
identify
judges
by
name
profiles
of
immigration
judges
were
drawn
up
separately
by
the
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
a
research
group
at
syracuse
university
they
show
that
the
24
judges
who
sit
today
in
miami
21
in
court
and
3
based
in
a
detention
facility
include
some
of
the
most
likely
and
least
likely
to
grant
asylum
according
to
the
clearinghouse
profiles
one
immigration
judge
currently
on
the
miami
court
mahlon
f
hanson
granted
3
percent
of
the
asylum
cases
he
heard
he
was
the
secondtoughest
judge
in
the
nation
on
asylum
issues
the
group
found
judge
denise
n
slavin
who
hears
cases
at
the
krome
north
detention
center
in
miami
granted
59
percent
of
the
asylum
claims
she
considered
placing
her
in
the
top
15
percent
of
judges
approving
such
claims
lawyers
said
the
variations
may
in
part
have
to
do
with
the
cases
particular
courts
are
handling
miami
immigration
courts
see
a
large
number
of
asylum
claims
from
haiti
and
the
judges
may
have
differing
outlooks
and
disagree
about
the
possibilities
for
haitians
to
face
persecution
in
their
country
the
variations
between
courts
and
among
judges
were
particularly
troubling
the
authors
of
the
study
argued
because
of
the
impact
of
procedural
changes
introduced
by
the
bush
administration
in
2002
at
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
the
appellate
body
that
reviews
decisions
by
the
immigration
court
judges
those
changes
led
to
a
sudden
and
lasting
decline
in
appeals
that
were
favorable
to
asylum
seekers
the
study
found
raising
doubts
as
to
whether
the
board
was
providing
fair
appeals
in
2002
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
made
streamlined
the
work
of
the
appeals
board
reducing
the
number
ofboard
members
to
11
from
23
and
encouraging
more
decisions
by
single
members
and
without
explanation
the
study
looked
at
76000
decisions
by
the
appeals
board
from
1998
through
2005
asylum
applicants
who
were
represented
by
lawyers
received
favorable
appeals
decisions
from
the
board
in
43
percent
of
cases
in
2001
the
year
before
the
changes
took
effect
by
2005
asylum
seekers
with
lawyers
won
their
appeals
in
13
percent
of
cases
the
judges
handle
a
very
large
caseload
theyre
human
they
are
not
going
to
catch
every
detail
said
mary
meg
mccarthy
director
of
the
national
immigrant
justice
center
a
legal
assistance
group
in
chicago
but
once
they
streamlined
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
ms
mccarthy
said
there
was
a
failure
of
the
board
to
review
those
cases
to
check
on
what
the
immigration
judge
had
found
when
that
failed
we
had
a
real
crisis
in
the
system
as
a
result
of
the
trends
at
the
appeals
board
there
has
been
a
new
surge
of
asylum
appeals
to
the
federal
circuit
courts
in
practice
the
last
resort
for
immigration
cases
over
all
the
number
of
people
winning
asylum
in
the
united
states
has
declined
dropping
by
about
12
percent
from
28684
in
2003
to
25257
in
2005
the
last
year
when
complete
figures
are
available
the
immigration
courts
have
been
in
the
spotlight
after
justice
department
officials
said
last
week
that
the
investigation
of
monica
m
goodling
a
former
aide
to
attorney
general
alberto
r
gonzales
has
been
expanded
to
include
her
role
in
helping
to
appoint
immigration
judges
ms
goodling
testified
last
week
that
she
had
crossed
the
line
in
applying
political
considerations
to
candidates
for
nonpartisan
legal
jobs
immigration
judges
are
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
and
49
of
226
current
judges
were
appointed
