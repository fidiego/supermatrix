while
congress
was
squabbling
last
year
about
whether
to
bar
more
immigrants
from
entering
the
united
states
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
jumped
27
percent
to
nearly
1million
people
these
were
people
that
the
country
welcomed
as
permanent
residents
to
take
 jobs
or
join
their
families
here
915900
immigrants
to
be
exact
this
represents
a
predictable
spike
in
the
level
of
immigration
experts
 say
and
the
numbers
should
decline
in
the
next
few
years
among
the
us
population
of
270million
last
years
immigrants
counted
as
 03
percent
yet
the
annual
figures
released
tuesday
by
the
immigration
and
 naturalization
service
renewed
the
debate
in
washington
about
whether
and
 how
much
immigration
is
good
for
the
country
there
are
three
schools
of
thought
 stop
all
immigration
for
several
years
until
those
already
here
can
assimilate
 let
anybody
come
who
wants
to
live
in
america
the
vast
majority
of
them
 will
work
and
pay
taxes
 allow
immigration
but
control
how
many
people
may
enter
and
why
they
are
coming
aim
to
admit
those
who
will
be
productive
or
who
have
family
here
 this
is
by
far
the
majority
view
congress
decided
last
year
not
to
limit
legal
immigration
any
further
but
 it
was
busy
on
other
fronts
the
laws
it
passed
now
make
it
easier
to
deport
illegal
aliens
and
make
it
harder
for
immigrants
to
claim
asylum
the
new
welfare
system
removes
most
benefits
from
legal
immigrants
 including
the
elderly
and
disabled
sen
ted
kennedy
and
others
plan
a
news
 conference
today
to
protest
that
law
and
president
clinton
has
proposed
to
 change
it
benefits
already
are
denied
to
the
4million
illegal
immigrants
living
in
 this
country
unless
their
children
are
us
citizens
who
were
born
here
nothing
passed
by
congress
last
year
changed
the
quotas
for
people
admitted
 to
the
country
legally
however
legal
immigration
is
a
highly
regulated
tightly
controlled
system  said
jeanne
butterfield
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers association
there
are
several
reasons
the
immigration
level
was
so
high
last
year
according
to
ins
and
other
experts
america
is
still
experiencing
an
immigration
bulge
based
on
the
1986
 amnesty
program
when
27million
illegal
immigrants
were
allowed
to
stay
they
have
become
citizens
and
are
now
sponsoring
their
spouses
and
children
 as
permanent
residents
the
us
does
not
limit
the
number
of
those
family
reunifications
and
about
300000
such
visas
were
issued
last
year
nearly
50
percent
more
than
usual
another
85000
visas
left
over
from
1995
were
added
to
the
family
category
 in
addition
immigrants
hired
to
work
in
this
country
largely
in
highly
 skilled
hightech
jobs
increased
by
38
percent
to
117499
it
means
the
golden
gate
has
been
inched
open
slightly
wider said
 stephen
moore
of
the
cato
institute
which
supports
unlimited
immigration
 we
should
be
proud
to
be
americans
the
lamp
is
lifted
slightly
higher
than
 it
was
in
the
past
the
influx
may
be
smaller
than
it
seems
many
of
the
family
members
admitted
to
join
us
citizens
already
were
 living
here
more
or
less
legally
the
government
decided
not
to
deport
the
 families
of
immigrants
granted
amnesty
in
1986
and
has
been
letting
them
live
 here
and
work
the
oneyear
jump
also
was
big
because
the
1995
figures
were
artificially
 low
ins
was
operating
with
new
procedures
in
1995
and
fell
behind
so
 thousands
of
people
who
should
have
been
admitted
in
1995
were
added
to
1996
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
wants
a
moratorium
on
immigration
complains
that
the
numbers
can
only
get
higher
or
the
waiting
lists
longer
as
more
immigrants
are
allowed
to
sponsor
family
members
responsible
leaders
have
a
greater
responsibility
to
understand
the
 forces
driving
todays
immigration
to
assess
its
true
impacts
on
poverty
 wage
flattening
public
costs
congestion
crime
and
environmental
 degradation
said
executive
director
dan
stein
in
a
statement
even
in
raw
numbers
immigration
is
not
at
record
levels
as
a
percentage
 of
the
population
it
is
nowhere
near
the
ellis
island
years
in
1910
 immigrants
arrived
at
a
pace
of
12
for
every
1000
residents
now
its
3
or
4
 per
1000
a
popular
analogy
among
proimmigration
people
in
washington
is
this
 imagine
yourself
in
a
ballroom
with
1000
people
champagne
flowing
waiters
 bringing
around
trays
of
hors
doeuvres
three
more
people
enter
the
room
 thats
the
impact
of
immigration
hardly
being
overrun
the
population
is
becoming
more
foreign
and
the
percentage
of
foreignborn
americans
has
roughly
doubled
since
1970
but
its
still
lower
than
at
the
 turn
of
the
century
about
9
percent
compared
to
nearly
15
percent
