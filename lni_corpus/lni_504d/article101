when
the
supreme
court
takes
up
the
constitutional
challenges
to
arizonas
immigration
enforcement
law
wednesday
the
seismic
impact
could
well
shake
the
future
of
utahs
own
immigration
law
theres
a
lot
at
stake
all
eyes
are
on
what
the
supreme
court
does
said
karen
tumlin
attorney
for
the
national
immigration
law
center
who
argued
on
behalf
of
plaintiffs
who
have
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
utahs
immigration
enforcement
law
hb497
the
law
was
passed
by
the
utah
legislature
in
2010
if
the
supreme
court
leaves
in
place
the
injunction
against
the
arizona
law
tumlin
said
the
national
centers
next
move
would
be
to
ask
us
district
judge
clark
waddoups
for
a
direct
full
opinion
on
the
utah
law
the
department
of
justice
sued
to
prevent
implementation
of
the
arizona
law
signed
into
law
april
2010
by
gov
jan
brewer
claiming
that
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
over
immigration
laws
arizona
appealed
that
decision
to
the
supreme
court
arguing
that
states
have
the
right
to
pass
legislation
because
the
federal
government
is
failing
to
control
illegal
immigration
waddoups
heard
oral
arguments
on
the
utah
case
in
february
but
put
the
matter
on
hold
awaiting
the
supreme
courts
ruling
on
the
arizona
case
in
his
order
informing
the
parties
of
his
decision
to
wait
the
judge
noted
while
arizonas
law
is
different
from
utahs
law
in
several
respects
some
aspects
are
sufficiently
similar
that
the
supreme
courts
ruling
likely
will
inform
this
court
in
its
decision
tumlin
said
monday
that
the
supreme
court
will
examine
four
provisions
of
the
arizona
law
three
of
which
are
similar
or
analogous
to
language
in
utahs
hb497
utahs
law
requires
police
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
people
arrested
for
felonies
and
class
a
misdemeanors
as
well
as
those
booked
into
jail
on
class
b
and
class
c
misdemeanors
it
also
says
officers
may
attempt
to
verify
the
status
of
people
detained
for
class
b
and
class
c
misdemeanors
arizonas
law
expanded
the
powers
of
state
police
to
ask
about
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
stop
and
to
hold
those
suspected
of
being
illegal
immigrants
arizonas
immigration
enforcement
law
went
too
far
in
some
respects
said
former
rep
stephen
sandstrom
the
legislative
sponsor
of
utahs
hb497
it
was
really
punitive
and
meanspirited
said
sandstrom
a
utah
county
republican
who
recently
stepped
down
from
the
legislature
to
run
for
congress
he
said
hb497
takes
a
more
prudent
approach
the
measure
was
intended
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
immigration
enforcement
activities
sandstrom
said
but
critics
including
the
us
department
of
justice
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
have
maintained
that
immigration
enforcement
is
nearly
exclusively
the
purview
of
the
federal
government
waddoups
order
informing
attorneys
of
his
decision
to
postpone
ruling
in
the
case
said
challenges
to
the
utah
law
focused
on
preemption
and
the
supremacy
clause
it
is
clear
that
the
united
states
has
preempted
state
action
to
a
certain
degree
in
area
of
immigration
how
extensive
that
preemption
is
however
is
less
clear
the
judge
wrote
indeed
the
case
centers
on
the
appropriate
role
for
states
to
be
involved
in
enforcement
of
immigration
laws

washington
ap
the
number
of
mexican
immigrants
living
illegally
in
the
us
has
dropped
significantly
for
the
first
time
in
decades
a
dramatic
shift
as
many
illegal
workers
already
in
the
us
and
seeing
few
job
opportunities
return
to
mexico

a
nation
accounting
for
nearly
60
percent
of
the
illegal
immigrants
in

it
comes
amid
renewed
debate
over
us
immigration
policy
as
the
supreme
court
hears
arguments
this
week
on
arizonas
tough
immigration
law
roughly
61
million

an
end
to

boom

stood
at

the
