bogota
mayor
steve
lonegan
one
of
the
states
most
vocal
proponents
for
a
hard
line
on
immigration
says
he
may
apply
for
a
federal
program
that
deputizes
local
police
to
enforce
immigration
laws
lonegan
says
that
although
illegal
immigration
is
not
a
burning
issue
in
his
onesquaremile
borough
federally
deputized
police
officers
would
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
wouldbe
bogota
residents
who
are
living
in
the
united
states
unlawfully
morristown
mayor
donald
cresitello
has
received
national
attention
as
he
awaits
a
decision
by
the
us
department
of
homeland
security
on
his
proposal
to
have
his
local
police
admitted
into
the
socalled
287g
program
this
comes
at
a
time
when
local
officials
across
the
country
increasingly
are
making
moves
to
address
illegal
immigration
citing
the
failure
of
national
political
leaders
to
reform
the
flawed
immigration
system
we
dont
have
a
day
laborer
problem
like
other
towns
in
bergen
county
lonegan
said
but
we
have
tough
loitering
laws
and
that
discourages
day
laborers
if
287g
will
help
bogota
and
the
quality
of
life
here
if
the
message
people
get
is
that
if
you
come
to
bogota
to
live
in
an
illegal
rental
unit
you
might
end
up
getting
deported
then
287g
makes
total
common
sense
to
me
representatives
from
groups
that
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
have
met
with
bogotas
police
chief
and
business
administrator
the
business
administrator
pat
obrien
declined
to
comment
the
police
chief
was
said
to
be
on
vacation
and
could
not
be
reached
law
enforcement
agencies
at
local
county
and
state
levels
who
are
deputized
to
enforce
immigration
laws
get
access
to
an
immigration
database
where
they
can
check
an
immigrants
status
and
other
information
these
deputized
authorities
can
then
detain
a
person
for
immigration
violations
and
begin
deportation
proceedings
against
them
agencies
in
about
a
dozen
states
are
part
of
the
287g
program
but
only
two
police
departments
in
new
hampshire
and
virginia
have
been
admitted
into
it
some
75
agencies
at
all
levels
of
government
have
applications
pending
for
admission
said
michael
gilhooly
a
spokesman
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
the
agency
within
homeland
security
that
runs
287g
about
20000
people
have
been
placed
in
deportation
proceedings
as
a
result
of
arrests
linked
to
287g
gilhooly
said
lonegan
suspects
that
unlawful
immigrants
burden
the
school
system
and
contribute
to
his
boroughs
growing
number
of
illegal
rental
units
he
said
that
while
tenants
can
be
reimbursed
for
rent
paid
to
an
unscrupulous
landlord
some
have
not
come
forward
to
collect
and
just
vanished
lonegans
interest
in
deputizing
the
boroughs
police
as
immigration
agents
drew
support
from
new
jersey
groups
that
favor
tough
immigration
enforcement
but
condemnation
from
immigration
advocates
federal
immigration
authorities
cant
be
everywhere
said
gayle
kesselman
cochairwoman
of
the
carlstadtbased
new
jersey
citizens
for
immigration
control
this
isnt
about
doing
sweeps
in
a
town
it
just
forms
a
partnership
between
local
police
and
the
federal
government
so
that
local
police
can
act
to
enforce
the
law
of
the
land
cresitello
the
morristown
mayor
said
that
the
lack
of
a
federal
solution
to
the
broken
immigration
system
leaves
local
officials
little
choice
its
more
important
now
than
ever
for
local
municipalities
to
do
this
said
cresitello
even
if
congress
had
done
something
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
the
local
level
is
where
a
lot
of
it
would
have
to
be
enforced
but
others
say
the
issue
is
a
federal
matter
and
should
remain
the
responsibility
of
mainly
the
federal
government
they
say
deputizing
local
police
as
immigration
agents
will
alienate
them
from
their
immigrant
community
members
they
also
question
the
motives
of
lonegan
who
has
locked
horns
with
immigration
advocates
and
hispanic
community
leaders
in
recent
years
in
2006
he
tried
to
force
the
removal
of
a
spanishlanguage
mcdonalds
billboard
that
advertised
its
iced
coffee
he
also
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
have
english
designated
the
towns
official
language
through
an
ordinance
that
would
have
required
all
borough
business
to
be
conducted
in
english
unless
mandated
differently
by
state
or
federal
law
if
you
want
to
disempower
a
community
you
start
by
aiming
for
its
weakest
link
said
cid
wilson
a
leonia
resident
and
past
president
of
the
dominican
american
national
roundtable
he
aims
for
illegal
immigrants
but
then
legal
immigrants
and
even
us
citizens
of
certain
ethnicities
im
a
us
citizen
and
hispanic
and
his
campaign
against
mcdonalds
advertisement
in
spanish
offended
me
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
illegal
immigration
borough
councilwoman
yesenia
frias
vowed
to
fight
any
effort
by
lonegan
to
deputize
police
to
enforce
immigration
laws
if
he
tries
to
really
initiate
this
i
will
get
every
single
hispanic
in
this
town
together
and
other
immigrants
from
haiti
africa
asia
everywhere
to
oppose
it
his
fight
against
mcdonalds
and
now
this
just
causes
a
lot
of
division
among
people
in
this
town
lonegan
balks
at
charges
that
his
actions
are
rooted
in
discrimination
or
that
they
are
antihispanic
i
am
just
trying
to
learn
about
287g
talk
to
other
towns
that
have
done
it
to
see
how
it
is
working
he
said
it
appears
to
be
a
commonsense
enhancement
of
the
polices
ability
to
do
their
work
i
come
from
an
immigrant
family
i
believe
we
need
to
live
by
the
rule
of
law
people
say
things
are
racist
when
they
dont
have
a
logical
argument
to
respond
to
something
