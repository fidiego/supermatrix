koreans
particularly
frequent
travelers
will
enjoy
a
more
convenient
immigration
inspection
at
us
airports
using
unmanned
immigration
autogates
beginning
later
this
year
if
implemented
korea
will
be
the
first
asian
nation
to
benefit
from
such
a
streamlined
us
immigration
process
and
the
third
in
the
world
after
germany
and
the
netherlands
the
ministry
of
justice
said
thursday
that
korea
immigration
service
commissioner
seok
donghyeon
reached
an
agreement
with
his
us
counterpart
alan
bersin
in
washington
to
allow
koreans
to
enter
the
us
through
unmanned
immigration
gates
installed
at
20
airports
across
the
country
under
the
reciprocal
agreement
americans
will
also
be
permitted
to
enter
korea
using
auto
immigration
gates
set
up
at
incheon
and
gimpo
international
airports
currently
korean
and
other
foreign
visitors
to
the
us
wait
in
long
lines
to
go
through
the
immigration
process
at
airports
they
are
required
to
have
their
fingerprints
and
photographs
taken
and
answer
questions
from
immigration
inspectors
about
the
purpose
of
their
visit
and
other
matters
but
to
benefit
from
the
planned
simple
immigration
process
koreans
are
still
expected
to
submit
fingerprints
and
other
biological
information
to
the
us
government
prior
to
their
trip
and
undergo
an
interview
with
us
immigration
officials
it
has
become
easier
for
koreans
to
travel
to
the
united
states
following
the
implementation
in
november
2008
of
a
us
visa
waiver
program
if
koreans
are
allowed
to
enter
the
us
using
an
unmanned
gate
instead
of
going
through
a
manned
immigration
checkpoint
it
will
make
things
much
more
convenient
said
seo
seokju
deputy
director
at
the
korea
immigration
service
seo
said
how
the
simplified
immigration
procedure
will
go
into
effect
and
other
details
still
need
to
be
worked
out
adding
workinglevel
officials
from
both
countries
will
hold
a
series
of
meetings
in
seoul
in
the
near
future
it
is
hard
to
say
at
the
moment
how
exactly
the
immigration
process
will
get
simpler
in
practice
we
think
that
what
the
us
has
in
place
for
germans
and
dutch
will
be
a
benchmark
for
us
which
means
koreans
will
be
required
to
submit
their
biological
information
and
have
an
interview
with
us
officials
but
if
they
do
it
once
they
will
benefit
whenever
they
go
to
the
us
he
said
under
the
global
entry
program
germans
and
dutch
can
enter
the
us
using
unmanned
gates
at
us
airports
to
benefit
from
it
they
have
to
be
precertified
by
us
immigration
officials
and
pay
100
in
fees
for
a
pass
valid
for
five
years
they
are
also
required
to
hand
over
their
biological
information
to
the
us
government
and
pass
an
interview
with
us
officials
seo
said
korean
government
officials
are
seeking
to
work
out
aspects
with
their
us
counterparts
as
quickly
as
possible
to
put
the
scheme
into
practice
within
this
year
