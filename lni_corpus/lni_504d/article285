as
congress
struggles
with
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
a
reasonable
assessment
of
the
underling
influences
shaping
conflicting
views
on
this
national
concern
is
warranted
all
antiimmigration
activists
are
now
wrapping
their
antiimmigrant
agenda
in
the
flag
ever
mindful
of
sept
11
and
the
fact
that
most
immigrants
are
from
nonwhite
european
countries
the
national
debate
on
immigration
is
now
framed
in
the
language
of
fear
patriotism
and
national
security
fears
about
immigrant
terrorists
after
sept
11
combined
with
rising
concerns
about
economic
security
after
the
end
of
the
90s
boom
have
diminished
the
nearterm
prospects
for
a
liberal
immigration
reform
agenda
rather
than
talk
about
new
policies
that
support
broad
legalization
amnesty
and
family
reunification
immigration
restrictions
have
moved
to
the
center
of
the
public
debate
the
antiimmigrant
forces
are
right
in
their
contention
that
immigration
legal
and
illegal
is
an
issue
that
needs
the
urgent
attention
of
policymakers
however
by
scapegoating
immigrants
for
so
many
of
the
countrys
ills
environmental
degradation
low
wages
tax
burdens
crime
social
disintegration
and
even
terrorist
threats
the
new
wave
of
restrictionists
are
building
a
vicious
backlash
movement
thats
deepening
the
social
economic
and
political
divides
in
the
nation
stereotypes
hinder
understanding
of
the
intensifying
immigration
debate
the
debate
divides
sharply
into
two
sides
on
one
side
stand
those
who
believe
that
immigration
flows
should
be
dramatically
restricted
commonly
described
as
being
antiimmigrant
these
groups
object
to
the
negative
label
saying
that
they
oppose
uncontrolled
immigration
not
immigrants
themselves
on
the
other
side
are
those
who
believe
that
immigration
should
be
regulated
but
at
levels
that
reflect
the
reality
of
both
emigration
pressures
outside
the
country
and
labor
needs
within
it
in
contrast
to
those
arguing
for
a
clamp
down
on
immigration
flows
these
forces
routinely
point
to
the
economic
and
cultural
benefits
resulting
from
the
immigrant
community
while
also
noting
that
the
united
states
has
always
been
a
nation
of
immigrants
those
advocating
reduced
immigration
flows
can
fairly
be
described
as
being
immigration
restrictionists
like
most
other
policy
reformers
the
immigration
restrictionists
have
three
main
bases
of
operation
policy
institutes
and
think
tanks
in
washington
dc
local
citizen
movements
and
organizations
and
a
loose
team
of
pundits
politicians
and
polemicists
dedicated
to
influencing
public
opinion
although
immigration
restrictionists
share
a
common
agenda
they
do
not
operate
as
a
unified
political
bloc
antiimmigration
forces
include
partisans
of
the
two
main
political
parties
as
well
as
adherents
of
parties
and
movements
on
the
political
left
and
right
that
fall
outside
mainstream
political
thinking
as
antiimmigration
sentiment
rises
the
voices
advocating
a
liberal
immigration
policy
confront
new
challenges
more
daunting
are
challenges
facing
proimmigration
groups
and
immigrant
advocates
as
they
seek
to
establish
a
framework
for
discussing
immigration
if
immigrant
advocates
and
immigrants
themselves
are
to
move
from
the
sidelines
to
the
center
of
the
intensifying
immigration
debate
and
by
doing
so
help
staunch
the
growing
influence
of
the
retrograde
restrictionist
forces
they
must
meet
five
major
challenges
the
first
challenge
is
to
gain
credibility
as
advocates
for
an
immigration
policy
that
considers
the
totality
of
us
national
interests
not
just
the
needs
and
problems
of
immigrants
or
the
demands
of
business
for
new
foreign
sources
of
cheap
and
skilled
labor
a
second
closely
related
challenge
is
helping
us
citizens
realize
that
their
communities
are
communities
that
include
a
wide
variety
of
immigrants
and
that
this
mix
is
a
healthy
one
the
third
challenge
is
overcoming
a
hesitation
to
describe
the
immigration
problem
as
a
class
problem
corporate
proimmigration
positions
often
coincide
with
those
of
immigrants
and
immigrant
advocates
but
failing
to
distinguish
between
immigration
reform
motivated
by
a
desire
for
cheap
labor
and
immigration
reform
advocated
to
attain
a
just
society
make
the
entire
proimmigration
movement
extremely
vulnerable
to
the
critique
that
it
is
an
open
borders
lobby
the
fourth
challenge
is
one
faced
by
more
than
just
immigrant
advocates
it
is
the
challenge
of
integrating
legitimate
concerns
and
demands
into
a
new
agenda
for
national
economic
development
if
proimmigration
advocates
are
to
stem
the
rising
forces
of
antiimmigrant
backlash
that
are
sweeping
the
united
states
and
gaining
momentum
throughout
the
world
they
must
ally
themselves
with
other
policy
reformers
who
are
beginning
to
make
the
case
that
development
must
be
redefined
to
mean
full
employment
livable
wages
an
organized
work
force
a
highly
educated
society
and
environmental
protection
and
restoration
the
fifth
challenge
is
connecting
the
dots
between
immigration
policy
and
foreign
policy
in
their
advocacy
and
education
antiimmigrant
forces
do
not
hesitate
to
describe
the
immigration
problem
as
an
international
one
painting
a
picture
of
the
united
states
beset
by
a
nonstop
invasion
of
the
worlds
poor
fleeing
war
corrupt
governments
and
the
lack
of
opportunity
at
home
the
simplicity
of
their
recommended
solutions
walling
the
united
states
in
and
deporting
all
those
without
residency
papers
appeals
to
those
who
believe
that
to
retain
the
present
standard
of
life
this
country
should
be
less
connected
to
the
rest
of
the
world
creating
a
fortress
america
those
who
oppose
the
fear
and
hate
politics
coursing
through
the
immigration
debate
cannot
deny
the
reality
that
the
united
states
still
represents
the
land
of
opportunity
for
people
of
an
increasing
number
of
countries
but
also
true
is
that
most
of
the
wouldbe
emigrants
would
prefer
to
live
and
work
in
their
home
countries
if
economic
and
social
conditions
improved
there
is
no
existing
or
proposed
immigration
policy
that
will
work
unless
it
works
in
conjunction
with
a
foreign
policy
based
on
good
neighbor
principles
and
a
deep
appreciation
of
interconnectedness
at
the
same
time
the
burden
of
addressing
the
immigration
crisis
whether
in
the
united
states
or
any
other
receiving
nation
is
first
the
responsibility
of
the
sending
nations
yes
nations
such
as
mexico
should
criticize
abusive
treatment
of
their
nationals
but
such
complaints
ring
hollow
if
they
are
not
backed
by
national
development
policies
that
aim
to
keep
their
own
citizens
at
home
rather
than
policies
that
directly
or
indirectly
contribute
to
their
expulsion
from
their
homes
longer
and
higher
border
walls
amnesty
guest
worker
programs
and
proposed
earned
citizenship
programs
are
all
temporary
fixes
immigration
policy
and
border
control
strategies
that
ignore
the
power
of
the
forces
of
supply
and
demand
while
at
the
same
time
narrowly
framing
immigration
policy
as
only
a
us
domestic
policy
problem
are
doomed
to
fail
