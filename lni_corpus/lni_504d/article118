top
promises
obameter
in
the
works
the
last
time
we
checked
on
this
promise
we
concluded
a
congress
with
republicans
in
control
of
the
us
house
of
representatives
was
highly
unlikely
to
approve
immigration
reform
thats
still
the
case
but
weve
noted
new
action
from
president
obama
trying
to
rekindle
public
conversation
and
reset
the
debate
in
favor
of
immigration
reform
in
recent
weeks
obama
has
hosted
three
separate
meetings
on
immigration
reform
primarily
with
people
who
support
his
views
on
the
matter
representatives
have
included
mayors
police
chiefs
business
executives
religious
leaders
celebrities
and
members
of
the
congressional
hispanic
caucus
the
statements
from
the
white
house
after
each
meeting
have
echoed
similar
themes
that
obama
would
like
fix
the
broken
immigration
system
that
he
was
disappointed
that
dream
act
see
update
below
failed
to
pass
last
year
that
he
was
working
to
improve
the
border
enforcement
and
the
legal
immigration
system
and
that
immigration
reform
requires
legislative
action
via
congress
the
point
to
the
meetings
though
looked
like
rallying
his
supporters
to
keep
up
their
own
work
on
immigration
in
a
synopsis
of
a
meeting
held
april
28
the
white
house
press
office
noted
the
president
urged
meeting
participants
to
help
elevate
the
debate
and
to
reach
out
in
their
unique
capacities
and
in
a
public
way
to
forge
partnerships
across
sectors
and
across
demographics
there
was
broad
agreement
that
more
voices
are
needed
to
change
the
tone
of
the
debate
so
that
congress
acts
to
fix
the
broken
system
in
a
way
that
upholds
americas
history
as
a
nation
of
laws
and
a
nation
of
immigrants
we
cant
say
that
we
see
evidence
that
congress
is
more
likely
to
address
immigration
reform
anytime
soon
but
obama
looks
to
be
rallying
his
troops
to
keep
immigration
reform
in
the
public
eye
in
the
course
of
our
research
we
ran
across
critics
who
said
this
is
for
electoral
purposes
to
ensure
he
retains
political
support
from
hispanics
going
into
the
2012
election
whatever
obamas
motivation
his
hosting
of
highprofile
meetings
for
immigration
reform
supporters
counts
for
our
purposes
we
cant
say
obamas
chances
for
ultimate
success
are
concretely
better
but
the
meetings
and
the
white
house
comments
are
enough
for
us
to
conclude
that
obama
intends
to
keep
pursuing
the
matter
obama
explicitly
asked
his
supporters
to
help
him
change
the
tone
of
the
debate
on
immigration
reform
in
order
to
create
a
friendlier
environment
for
congressional
action
so
we
move
the
meter
on
this
promise
from
stalled
to
in

the
last
time
we
checked
in
on
this
promise
president
obama
said
he
would
not
be
moving
on
immigration
reform
in
2009
and
we
rated
the
promise
stalled
in
2010
obama
and
his
fellow
democrats
pressed
forward
with
the
development
relief
and
education
for
alien
minors
act
better
known
as
the
dream
act
the
dream
act
was
a
measure
to
intended
give
a
path
to
citizenship
to
illegal
immigrants
who
were
brought
to
the
united
states
as
children
as
long
as
they
completed
schooling
or
served
in
the
military
and
maintained
good
moral
character
while
it
passed
in
the
us
house
of
representatives
it
failed
procedural
hurdles
in
the
senate
and
never
came
to
a
vote
the
november
elections
mean
the
house
will
have
a
republican
majority
in
2011
making
passage
of
the
dream
act
significantly
more
difficult
not
to
mention
passage
of
a
path
to
citizenship
for
all
illegal
immigrants
in
fact
republicans
have
said
they
intend
to
focus
on
enforcement
action
it
is
pointless
to
talk
about
any
new
immigration
bills
that
grant
amnesty
until
we
secure
the
border
since
such
bills
will
only
encourage
more
illegal
immigration
said
incoming
house
judiciary
chairman
lamar
smith
rtexas
in
a
statement
obama
said
that
the
failure
of
the
dream
act
was
maybe
my
biggest
disappointment
of
the
lame
duck
session
and
that
he
remained
committed
to
both
the
dream
act
and
a
comprehensive
immigration
law
he
said
he
intended
to
talk
more
about
immigration
in
the
coming
year
in
hopes
of
to
making
it
more
politically
popular
in
rating
this
promise
we
see
little
reason
to
expect
progress
anytime
soon
though
obama
has
said
he
intends
to
continue
to
press
for
a
path
to

for
those
waiting
for
president
barack
obama
to
keep
his
promise
to
create
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
immigrants
obama
has
said
he
does
intend
to
fulfill
his
immigration
promise
but
he
has
also
said
he
will
not
tackle
the
issue
in
2009
instead
immigration
reform
must
get
in
line
behind
health
care
reform
financial
regulations
and
a
capandtrade
plan
on
climate
change
obama
gave
some
of
his
most
extended
remarks
on
the
matter
at
an
august
news
conference
with
the
leaders
of
mexico
and
canada
he
said
he
would
push
for
immigration
reform
in
2010
after
the
other
initiatives
had
been
handled
now
am
i
going
to
be
able
to
snap
my
fingers
and
get
this
done
no
this
is
going
to
be
difficult
its
going
to
require
bipartisan
cooperation
there
are
going
to
be
demagogues
out
there
who
try
to
suggest
that
any
form
of
pathway
for
legalization
for
those
who
are
already
in
the
united
states
is
unacceptable
obama
said
so
obama
has
said
hes
not
moving
on
this
promise
in
2009
hes
taken
steps
to
appease
critics
of
illegal
immigration
in
the
debate
over
health
care
reform
for
example
he
added
restrictions
to
specifically
bar
illegal
immigrants
from
using
their
own
money
to
purchase
health
insurance
through
any
new
health
insurance
exchanges
pending
proposals
already
barred
illegal
immigrants
from
receiving
subsidized
care
obama
said
that
he
will
not
push
for
a
path
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
in
2009
