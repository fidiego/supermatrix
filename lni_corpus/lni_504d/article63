cynics
in
congress
eager
to
derail
landmark
legislation
to
overhaul
the
nations
broken
immigration
system
have
seized
on
last
weeks
events
in
boston
as
a
pretext
to
slow
momentum
on
the
issue
in
the
process
they
may
unwittingly
provide
a
push
for
the
very
bill
they
hope
to
derail
with
scant
regard
for
the
actual
immigration
status
of
the
bombing
suspects
who
came
to
this
country
legally
as
minors
sen
charles
e
grassley
riowa
nonetheless
framed
the
attacks
in
boston
in
the
context
of
the
debate
over
immigration
with
a
suspect
still
at
large
friday
he
asked
how
do
we
ensure
that
people
who
wish
to
do
us
harm
are
not
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
immigration
laws
including
this
new
bill
before
us
his
fellow
republican
sen
rand
paul
of
kentucky
then
sent
a
letter
to
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
dnev
arguing
that
the
senate
should
not
proceed
with
immigration
reform
until
we
understand
the
specific
failures
in
our
immigration
system
just
what
flaws
in
the
immigration
system
are
the
senators
talking
about
the
failure
to
divine
the
future
and
predict
that
tamerlan
tsarnaev
who
was
a
teenager
when
his
family
immigrated
and
his
surviving
brother
dzhokhar
who
was
9
might
become
radicalized
years
after
arriving
in
fact
the
senators
arent
raising
real
questions
about
immigration
theyre
more
interested
in
stirring
fear
fear
that
immigration
reform
may
somehow
open
americas
gateways
to
even
more
scary
foreigners
and
more
terrorist
attacks
and
that
undocumented
immigrants
already
here
who
would
receive
legal
status
under
a
senate
bill
would
be
threats
in
our
midst
free
to
circulate
as
they
please
one
potential
casualty
of
playing
politics
with
immigration
reform
in
this
way
is
the
refugee
asylum
program
which
has
been
at
the
heart
of
americas
immigration
system
for
years
it
was
as
asylumseekers
that
the
tsarnaev
family
received
permission
to
stay
here
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
have
arrived
on
these
shores
over
the
years
as
asylumseekers
minuscule
numbers
of
them
have
posed
any
threat
to
national
security
from
what
is
publicly
known
if
any
governmental
failure
allowed
the
suspects
to
slip
through
the
cracks
and
thats
far
from
certain
at
this
point
it
was
an
intelligence
failure
not
an
immigration
failure
the
real
immigration
failure
is
the
perpetuation
of
a
system
that
forces
11
million
undocumented
migrants
most
of
whom
have
been
here
for
more
than
a
decade
to
live
and
work
in
the
shadows
by
extending
legal
status
to
undocumented
residents
immigration
reform
would
bring
them
into
the
sunlight
in
the
process
of
applying
for
documents
they
would
be
identified
subjected
to
fingerprinting
and
background
checks
and
ultimately
integrated
into
american
society
that
could
only
enhance
the
nations
security
and
its
one
of
many
powerful
arguments
for
reform
too
many
opponents
of
immigration
reform
still
cling
to
the
fantasy
of
mass
deportation
seeing
the
boston
bombing
suspects
as
convenient
catalysts
they
hope
to
galvanize
the
nations
anger
that
tactic
has
worked
at
times
in
american
history
it
mustnt
be
allowed
to
work
now
