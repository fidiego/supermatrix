immigrant
rights
and
feminist
organizations
are
coming
together
in
an
attempt
to
reframe
immigration
as
a
womens
issue
which
they
hope
will
redefine
the
fight
over
changing
the
nations
immigration
laws
so
far
the
groups
have
sought
to
influence
immigration
legislation
in
the
senate
undertaken
largescale
demonstrations
and
united
national
womens
groups
and
even
as
chances
of
an
immigration
overhaul
have
faded
in
recent
weeks
their
efforts
have
mobilized
women
across
the
country
when
you
ask
people
what
images
they
think
of
when
they
think
of
immigration
reform
its
often
men
scary
looking
scaling
the
border
walls
said
pramila
jayapal
cochair
of
we
belong
together
a
national
immigration
campaign
that
focuses
on
women
the
idea
that
its
really
women
and
children
that
are
the
majority
of
immigrants
to
the
united
states
is
completely
lost
the
groups
see
opposition
to
a
comprehensive
immigration
overhaul
as
having
a
larger
effect
on
gender
equality
and
they
say
it
is
part
of
a
war
on
women
that
devalues
the
work
of
female
immigrants
and
keeps
them
vulnerable
their
opponents
meanwhile
see
it
as
nothing
more
than
a
stunt
to
push
a
pro
immigration
agenda
gender
is
immaterial
to
immigration
policy
they
said
saying
a
vote
against
immigration
reform
is
a
vote
against
women
is
dishonest
and
insulting
said
kristen
williamson
spokeswoman
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
promotes
policies
that
reduce
immigration
in
reality
a
vote
for
amnesty
and
increased
immigration
is
a
vote
against
the
american
worker
although
household
workers
many
of
whom
are
immigrants
began
organizing
as
part
of
the
feminist
movement
in
the
1970s
a
comprehensive
case
for
immigration
as
a
womens
issue
was
not
made
until
2010
when
jayapal
collaborated
with
feminist
icon
gloria
steinem
to
write
an
article
linking
the
issues
since
then
the
cause
has
brought
together
immigrant
and
feminist
organizations
including
the
miami
workers
center
the
georgia
latino
alliance
for
human
rights
the
national
organization
for
women
and
the
global
womens
institute
from
our
perspective
the
coalition
in
support
of
immigration
reform
has
never
been
as
big
and
diverse
as
it
is
now
said
natalie
camastra
a
policy
analyst
for
the
national
latina
institute
for
reproductive
health
in
september
105
women
activists
were
arrested
at
an
immigrant
rights
demonstration
in
washington
the
september
protest
was
followed
by
nine
demonstrations
that
targeted
house
of
representatives
republicans
in
different
cities
across
the
country
all
organized
by
we
belong
together
according
to
advocates
more
than
a
quarter
of
employment
visas
go
to
women
as
the
primary
holders
because
the
system
prioritizes
maledominated
industries
such
as
technology
in
addition
more
visas
are
available
for
workers
with
higher
skills
and
education
which
many
women
cannot
get
in
their
countries
of
origin
this
means
the
majority
of
immigrant
women
rely
on
the
familybased
visa
system
and
thus
are
disproportionately
represented
in
the
backlog
of
43
million
immigrants
awaiting
such
visas
the
coalition
of
women
says
these
elements
of
the
immigration
system
make
it
harder
for
female
immigrants
including
those
who
are
already
here
their
opponents
say
the
us
should
not
structure
its
system
around
needs
of
nonamericans
women
in
both
chambers
of
congress
have
collaborated
with
advocates
to
discuss
provisions
aimed
at
protecting
women
like
creating
more
visas
for
femaledominated
industries
when
the
senate
passed
comprehensive
immigration
legislation
in
june
sen
mazie
hirono
dhawaii
wrote
an
amendment
aimed
at
womens
needs
she
united
a
group
of
13
of
the
senates
20
women
including
one
republican
in
order
to
get
it
passed
it
was
important
for
me
to
go
to
the
women
senators
and
garner
their
support
because
the
gang
of
eight
didnt
think
of
this
she
said
adding
that
the
bill
written
by
the
eight
male
senators
inadvertently
disadvantaged
women
by
putting
an
emphasis
on
highskilled
work
in
the
house
congresswomen
have
united
in
the
congressional
womens
working
group
on
immigration
reform
chaired
by
rep
lucille
roybalallard
dcalif
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
specific
needs
of
immigrant
women
are
heard
and
expressed
during
the
debate
she
said
in
an
interview
comprehensive
overhaul
has
not
yet
been
brought
to
a
vote
in
the
house
though
speaker
john
boehner
rohio
said
nov
21
that
congress
needs
to
address
the
issue
editors
story
can
end
here
opponents
of
the
senate
plan
said
that
the
us
must
focus
on
americans
best
interests
regardless
of
any
genderspecific
impact
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
more
helpful
if
these
womens
groups
and
the
women
senators
were
more
concerned
about
how
single
mothers
in
america
are
faring
said
rosemary
jenks
director
of
government
relations
at
numbersusa
which
promotes
decreasing
the
number
of
immigrants
to
the
us
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
bills
itself
as
lowimmigration
proimmigrant
said
women
probably
do
face
challenges
these
women
are
in
foreign
families
hundreds
of
miles
from
home
in
a
strange
culture
that
would
be
the
case
even
if
they
were
legal
immigrants
that
would
be
with
case
with
an
american
woman
moving
from
virginia
to
oregon
but
movement
leaders
said
the
immigration
fight
has
a
much
broader
implication
regarding
equality
in
the
united
states
the
reality
is
that
if
a
woman
immigrant
or
otherwise
is
discriminated
against
is
treated
as
less
than
equal
then
that
impacts
all
women
