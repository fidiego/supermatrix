immigration
and
many
americans
conjure
up
visions
of
desperate
men
women
and
children
sneaking
across

border
wiggling
their
way
into
american
jobs
and
onto

its
not
often
one
considers
the
northern
border
of
the
united
states
and
how
it
contributes
to
the
countrys
wave
of
legal
and
illegal
immigration
yet
according
to
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
canada
is
the
fourthlargest
source
of
illegal
immigration
in
the
united
states
proposed
changes
in
immigration
laws
although
aimed
mostly
at
the
southern
border
will
affect
canadians
and
the
northern
border
as
well
true
canadians
are
not
significant
contributors
when
you
look
at
illegal
or
legal
immigration
and
the
big
picture
said
david
hirson
a
california
attorney
who
specializes
in
immigration
law
but
immigration
is
immigration
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
stricter
regulation
if
proposals
now
in

pass
fees
will
be
charged
people
crossing
back

canada
increased
border
patrols
could
slow
crossing
times
employers
would
have
to
be
more
careful
in
inspecting
the
documents
of
new
workers
and
legal
immigration
would
be
cut
back
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
estimates
that
of
the
roughly
4
million
illegal
immigrants
living
in
the
united
states
97000
are
from
canada
behind
13
million
from
mexico
327000
from
el
salvador
and
129000
from
guatemala
there
were
17156
legal
canadian
immigrants
in
1992
the
last
year
the
immigration
agency
compiled
such
statistics
some
immigration
groups
say
that
large
numbers
of
them
live
in
the
los
angeles
area
and
in
michigan
and
florida
at
least
half
of
the
illegal
canadians
in
the
united
states
entered
the
country
legally
then
overstayed
their
visas
said
stan
cannon
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
for
whatever
reason
they
decided
not
to
go
back
or
renew
their
status
he
said
and
because
they
blend
in
so
well
they
stay
on
for
years
without
changing
their
status
blend
in
well
larry
olson
supervisory
special
agent
with
the
immigration
agency
in
st
paul
minn
said
the
fact
that
canadians
blend
in
so
well
is
one
reason
why
they
may
not
be
investigated
as
aggressively
as
other
illegal
immigrants
where
we
might
get
information
on
a
group
of
mexicans
working
illegally
here
we
dont
as
much
with
canadians
he
said
its
just
harder
to
pick
up
on
where
the
illegal
canadians
are
and
who
they
are
still
the
us
border
patrol
office
in
grand
forks
nd
said
that
it
arrested
1237
illegal
immigrants
in
1994
many
of
them
for
using
fraudulent
documents
to
obtain
work
and
about
a
fifth
of
them
were
canadians
more
than
half
of
the
immigrants
arrested
were
deported
the
border
patrol
said
lonny
schweitzer
an
intelligence
agent
in
the
grand
forks
border
patrol
office
said
canadians
are
generally
easier
to
deport
because
the
border
is
so
close
and
they
tend
to
volunteer
to
return
to
canada
rather
than
challenge
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
restrictions
certain
as
the
federal
government
cracks
down
on
immigration
it
appears
almost
certain
that
any
new
policy
will
restrict
the
number
of
people
who
will
be
allowed
to
enter
the
united
states
experts
say
proposals
to
control
legal
immigration
by
requiring
applicants
to
be
able
to
support
themselves
would
not
affect
canadians
much
because
they
tend
to
be
better
educated
and
equipped
to
work
when
they
arrive
in
the
united
states
but
some
immigration
experts
argue
that
being
highly
skilled
could
work
against
canadians
as
the
immigration
debate
plays
out
from
a
workers
perspective
canadians
would
appear
to
be
much
more
of
a
threat
to
the
angry
white
male
than
another
immigrant
who
lacks
education
and
job
skills
