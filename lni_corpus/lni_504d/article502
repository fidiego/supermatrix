the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
issued
an
order
for
the
deportation
monday
of
a
28yearold
citizen
of
nicaragua
who
says
that
at
home
he
will
be
drafted
into
the
army
of
the
sandinista
government
which
president
reagan
has
called
a
brutal
communist
aggressor
the
nicaraguan
marcos
perezroblero
who
says
he
opposes
the
sandinista
government
came
to
the
united
states
in
1979
to
visit
his
mother
according
to
david
carliner
a
lawyer
representing
him
in
efforts
to
delay
the
deportation
mr
perezs
mother
has
permanent
resident
status
here
mr
carliner
said
that
mr
perez
in
violation
of
his
status
as
a
visitor
which
prohibits
temporary
immigrants
from
holding
jobs
had
been
working
as
a
parking
lot
attendant
and
had
also
overstayed
his
original
sixmonth
visa
mr
carliner
said
mr
perezs
difficulties
began
when
he
wrote
to
the
immigration
service
office
here
last
fall
to
apply
for
admission
as
a
permanent
resident
his
mothers
resident
status
would
give
him
preference
for
admission
return
to
nicaragua
under
immigration
service
rules
mr
perez
was
required
either
to
leave
the
united
states
and
make
his
application
at
an
american
consulate
in
his
own
country
or
to
obtain
an
exemption
that
would
permit
him
to
make
an
application
for
readmission
in
mexico
mr
carliner
said
that
immigration
officials
had
declined
to
grant
his
client
the
exemption
and
that
if
mr
perez
returned
to
nicaragua
immigration
service
rules
would
require
him
as
an
alien
deported
by
the
united
states
to
wait
five
years
before
applying
officials
of
the
immigration
service
familiar
with
mr
perezs
case
could
not
be
reached
today
but
vernon
jarvis
a
spokesman
for
the
service
said
i
am
sure
no
one
is
deported
without
having
a
hearing
before
an
immigration
judge
and
exhausting
his
appeals
mr
carliner
filed
a
motion
thursday
for
an
emergency
stay
of
deportation
with
joan
arrowsmith
a
judge
in
the
office
of
immigration
review
mr
perez
said
that
if
the
motion
was
not
granted
before
he
was
put
aboard
an
airplane
for
nicaragua
monday
he
would
be
drafted
to
fight
against
the
interests
of
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
a
government
which
the
united
states
views
as
