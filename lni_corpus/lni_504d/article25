while

in
recent
years
the
obama
administration
has
issued
policy
orders
directing
immigration
authorities
to
exercise
discretion
when
deciding
which
immigrants
living
in
the
country
illegally
should
be
deported
thenhomeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
said
discretion
should
be
used
for
immigrants
who
didnt
pose
a
threat
to
national
security
or
public
safety
in
2011
the
government
reviewed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
pending
in
immigration
courts
the
effort
was
designed
to
curtail
the
backlog
of
more
than
300000
pending
cases
tens
of
thousands
of
cases
were
eventually
dismissed
but
there
are
now
more
than
360000
cases
pending
according
to
trac
in
2012
obama
also
created
a
program
called
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
to
allow
tens
of
thousands
of
young
immigrants
living
in
the
united
states
illegally
to
apply
to
stay
in
the
country
for
up
to
two
years
and
get
a
work
permit

an

texas
immigration
lawyer
said
it
may
be
too
soon
to
know
what
the
trac
data
means
for
immigration
enforcement
she
said
immigration
court
backlogs
mean
cases
now
being
heard
by
immigration
judges
could
be
years
old
and
though
immigration
laws
have
not
changed
in
recent
years
some
immigrants
may
be
more
successful
in
arguing
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
country
based
on
those
discretion
memos
the
true
implications
of
these
numbers
are
murky
and
people
shouldnt
jump
to
conclusions
yet

said
it
would
be
difficult

the
