sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
introduced
a
bill
yesterday
to
overhaul
the
nations
legal
immigration
system
by
sharply
reducing
annual
admissions
of
familysponsored
immigrants
and
imposing
new
restrictions
on
those
who
come
to
the
united
states
for
employment
citing
a
need
for
a
breathing
space
in
the
annual
growth
of
legal
immigration
simpson
said
his
bill
would
curtail
the
chain
migration
of
immigrants
extended
families
and
protect
us
workers
and
new
college
graduates
from
unfair
competition
by
foreigners
who
often
accept
lower
wages
the
proposed
legislation
would
lower
nonrefugee
admissions
by
about
25
percent
to
540000
a
year
including
90000
employmentrelated
immigrants
and
450000
familysponsored
immigrants
in
a
major
change
certain
to
encounter
stiff
opposition
from
us
businesses
the
bill
would
also
effectively
bar
companies
from
hiring
foreign
students
immediately
upon
graduation
from
american
universities
the
bill
is
the
last
major
piece
of
a
series
of
gop
legislative
initiatives
aimed
at
reducing
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
while
there
is
a
broad
bipartisan
consensus
on
the
need
to
fight
illegal
immigration
measures
to
pare
down
family
and
employmentbased
legal
admissions
have
aroused
intense
controversy
in
both
parties
and
are
expected
to
become
a
hot
political
issue
in
the
1996
election
year
a
broad
immigration
bill
that
passed
the
house
judiciary
committee
last
month
has
sharply
split
republicans
creating
some
strange
political
bedfellows
on
key
issues
and
foreshadowing
a
potentially
divisive
debate
when
the
bill
reaches
the
house
floor
probably
next
year
the
house
bill
introduced
by
rep
lamar
smith
rtex
and
passed
23
to
10
by
the
judiciary
committee
on
oct
24
already
is
coming
under
attack
from
an
unlikely
alliance
of
conservative
republicans
liberal
democrats
immigration
advocates
and
elements
of
the
business
community
they
want
to
split
the
bill
allowing
provisions
on
illegal
immigration
to
go
forward
while
shelving
the
sections
on
legal
immigration
in
introducing
his
longawaited
bill
on
the
senate
floor
yesterday
simpson
who
chairs
the
senate
subcommittee
on
immigration
said
americans
are
growing
increasingly
restless
and
dissatisfied
with
annual
levels
of
immigration
that
are
more
than
five
times
higher
than
they
were
in
1953
including
refugee
admissions
legal
immigration
exceeds
800000
a
year
curbing
even
stopping
illegal
immigration
is
not
enough
he
said
it
is
time
to
slow
down
to
reassess
to
make
certain
we
are
assimilating
well
the
extraordinary
level
of
immigration
the
country
has
been
experiencing
in
recent
years
simpson
indicated
he
wants
to
combine
the
new
bill
with
a
pending
one
on
illegal
immigration
before
presenting
the
package
to
the
full
senate
judiciary
committee
this
year
he
said
his
bill
would
limit
familybased
immigration
to
the
spouses
and
unmarried
minor
children
of
us
citizens
with
some
exceptions
for
parents
and
would
cap
visas
allotted
to
spouses
and
unmarried
minor
children
of
lawful
permanent
aliens
at
85000
a
year
in
addition
150000
of
the
450000
annual
familysponsored
immigrant
visas
would
go
toward
reducing
a
backlog
of
more
than
11
million
spouses
and
minor
children
of
permanent
residents
whose
petitions
have
been
approved
the
bill
does
not
deal
with
refugees
of
whom
90000
can
be
admitted
next
year
some
of
the
bills
most
controversial
provisions
call
for
capping
employmentbased
permanent
immigration
at
90000
a
year
down
from
140000
at
present
and
requiring
employers
to
pay
a
fee
equal
to
30
percent
of
the
immigrant
workers
annual
salary
into
a
fund
to
finance
the
training
of
american
workers
additional
provisions
are
aimed
at
discouraging
the
use
of
temporary
foreign
workers
to
replace
americans
foreign
students
who
graduate
from
us
universities
would
have
to
work
outside
the
united
states
for
two
to
five
years
depending
on
their
education
level
and
desired
immigration
status
before
they
could
come
back
as
employmentbased
temporary
or
permanent
immigrants
in
the
house
10
california
republicans
signed
a
letter
urging
the
bill
be
split
to
avoid
further
delay
of
needed
efforts
to
stop
illegal
immigration
the
letter
argued
that
linking
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
the
same
bill
has
resulted
in
a
backlash
of
resentment
from
our
legal
immigrant
communities
the
signatories
included

david
dreier

in
response
35
congressmen
wrote
to
speaker
newt
gingrich
to
strongly
oppose
dropping
legal
immigration
reform
from
the
bill
warning
that
such
a
move
could
have
serious
political
consequences
in
the
1996
presidential
and
congressional
elections
among

high

of

have
resulted
in

scarce

a
