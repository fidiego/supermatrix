fauziya
kasingas
case
has
been
heard
and
rejected
by
asylum
officers
and
immigration
judges
of
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
now
she
waits
in
a
cold
york
pa
prison
cell
to
go
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
since
arriving
in
this
country
two
years
ago
from
africa
at
the
age
of
17
kasinga
has
been
shackled
imprisoned
denied
clean
 underwear
and
put
in
an
isolation
cell
for
performing
the
morning
muslim
 ritual
of
washing
her
hands
to
pray
last
year
during
a
melee
at
esmor
 detention
center
she
was
beaten
and
teargassed
kasinga
was
stripsearched
and
put
in
maximum
security
when
her
quest
for
political
asylum
ended
at
esmor
her
crime
she
was
fleeing
female
genital
mutilation
in
her
country
after
an
arranged
marriage
by
an
aunt
and
she
 lacked
proper
documents
when
she
arrived
in
the
united
states
women
who
leave
their
native
country
because
of
the
cultural
ritual
of
 genital
mutilation
are
a
rarity
while
the
immigration
and
naturalization
 service
has
issued
a
policy
that
allows
asylum
officers
to
consider
female
 genital
mutilations
when
they
adjudicate
asylum
claims
for
women
the
policy
 is
not
binding
on
immigration
judges
if
they
were
serious
why
werent
they
 issued
as
binding
regulations kasingas
attorney
karen
musalo
asked
this
painful
story
of
an
innocent
woman
who
arrived
on
these
shores
 expecting
justice
after
fleeing
cultural
injustice
is
not
unique
immigrants
 fleeing
political
persecution
who
arrive
without
family
ties
or
proper
 documentation
often
end
up
behind
bars
the
picture
worsens
under
the
immigration
and
antiterrorism
bills
congress
 is
considering
if
congress
has
its
way
we
wont
even
know
about
the
 fauziya
kasinga
stories
in
the
future musalo
says
when
they
arrive
at
 the
airport
they
will
have
a
onehour
interview
with
an
officer
whose
 decision
will
be
reviewed
by
his
supervisor
if
the
supervisor
agrees
that
the
 person
should
not
be
allowed
into
the
country
they
will
be
put
back
on
the
 plane
immediately
kasingas
dilemma
is
another
graphic
example
of
the
inexcusable
flaws
in
 our
immigration
policies
many
desperate
asylum
seekers
have
been
imprisoned
 or
turned
away
because
of
arbitrary
distinctions
between
political and
economic refugees
others
such
as
kasinga
have
been
denied
because
immigration
rules
do
not
properly
account
for
the
horror
of
female
genital
mutilation
the
socalled
immigration
reforms
now
being
considered
by
congress
do
not
provide
for
a
comprehensive
overhaul
of
the
policies
that
have
made
the
quest
for
political
asylum
so
confusing
and
frustrating
for
many
legitimate
 refugees
but
even
the
problems
with
the
current
rules
cannot
account
for
the
 inhumane
treatment
fauziya
kasinga
has
received
from
the
government
that
she
 had
hoped
would
protect
her
she
asks
as
do
we
what
has
she
done
wrong
to
be
 imprisoned
for
two
years
