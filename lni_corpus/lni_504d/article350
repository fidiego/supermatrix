the
man
at
the
centre
of
the
supreme
court
of
canadas
decision
that
paid
immigration
consultants
do
not
have
to
be
lawyers
says
they
must
be
subjected
to
the
same
rules
as
those
governing
the
legal
profession
ive
always
held
the
position
publicly
that
immigration
consultants
should
be
properly
regulated
and
licensedjaswant
mangat
told
the
lawyers
weekly
what
happened
in
the
united
states
on
sept
11
makes
it
all
that
more
important
that
the
federal
government
should
look
into
this
so
there
is
accountability
just
as
there
is
with
lawyers
his
opponent
in
law
society
of
british
columbia
v
mangat
seems
to
agree
with
him
immigrants
and
refugees
are
an
extremely
vulnerable
portion
of
canadian
society
and
they
need
to
be
represented
by
people
who
are
licensed
regulated
and
ethicalsaid
howard
berge
second
vicepresident
of
the
law
society
we
dont
think
the
federal
government
ever
intended
to
create
an
environment
so
that
immigration
consultants
are
not
regulated
at
allhe
added
vancouver
lawyer
catherine
sas
who
specializes
in
immigration
matters
said
now
that
mangat
has
been
decided
hopefully
the
minister
of
citizenship
and
immigration
elinor
caplan
will
come
forward
and
regulate
consultants
quickly
douglas
cannon
of
vancouvers
elgin
cannon
associates
who
handles
immigration
and
refugee
law
pointed
out
that
you
can
be
anybody
and
call
yourself
an
immigration
consultant
there
are
numerous
examples
of
disreputable
immigration
consultants
who
leave
normally
vulnerable
people
in
a
terrible
predicament
through
bad
advice
and
unethical
conduct
the
federal
government
needs
to
protect
immigrants
and
refugees
by
regulating
standards
of
competence
in
this
area
ultimately
what
matters
is
that
an
advisor
is
giving
good
advice
with
professional
standards
and
ethical
considerations
thats
a
minimum
requirement
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
immigration
system
eric
rice
president
of
the
canadian
bar
association
explained
that
we
essentially
supported
the
bc
law
societys
case
our
complaint
was
not
against
immigration
consultants
as
such
we
just
felt
that
if
theyre
going
to
be
in
a
responsible
position
with
vulnerable
people
like
that
they
should
be
regulated
they
should
be
supervised
the
same
way
lawyers
are
they
should
have
the
qualifications
to
act
they
should
be
insured
the
same
way
lawyers
are
they
should
be
prevented
from
practising
if
theyre
unethical
or
if
they
are
incompetent
not
to
say
that
all
of
them
are
that
way
at
all
rice
said
ottawa
should
regulate
immigration
consultants
mangat
now
58
and
licensed
to
practise
law
in
ontario
and
alberta
suggested
the
federal
government
could
come
to
some
arrangement
with
the
law
societies
so
the
immigration
consultants
could
work
with
lawyers
that
way
the
lawyers
would
be
responsible
for
the
actions
of
their
employees
he
said
he
was
relieved
at
the
top
courts
decision
after
an
eightyear
battle
at
the
same
time
its
a
terrible
thing
to
go
through
its
very
painful
mangat
now
handles
mostly
immigration
matters
some
matrimonial
and
criminal
cases
and
a
little
real
estateout
of
his
mississauga
law
office
he
believes
immigration
consultants
should
have
minimum
standards
so
far
as
education
and
qualifications
are
concerned
they
should
have
trust
funds
and
there
should
be
severe
penalties
for
any
infractions
but
he
feels
the
scc
decision
vindicates
me
and
upholds
the
position
ive
had
all
along
mangat
was
operating
an
immigration
consulting
business
in
vancouver
in
early
1994
when
the
law
society
applied
to
the
bc
supreme
court
for
an
injunction
to
prevent
him
and
his
firm
from
engaging
in
the
ongoing
practice
of
law
in
contravention
of
british
columbias
legal
profession
act
it
was
eventually
granted
but
was
overturned
by
the
bc
court
of
appeal
the
law
society
appealed
to
the
nations
top
court
which
dismissed
the
appeal
on
oct
18
the
case
dealt
specifically
with
hearings
before
the
immigration
and
refugee
board
writing
for
a
unanimous
scc
justice
charles
gonthier
found
the
provisions
of
the
immigration
act
at
issue
to
be
valid
and
paramount
over
the
provisions
of
the
legal
profession
act
as
a
result
an
injunction
against
mangat
and
his
firm
cannot
be
granted
in
respect
of
the
activities
complained
of
in
any
event
the
judge
noted
the
issue
is
moot
as
mangat
is
now
a
practising
lawyer
and
his
company
has
since
been
dissolved
he
has
no
intention
of
returning
to
his
former
work
of
immigration
consultant
mangat
said
that
among
the
intervenors
the
federal
government
supported
my
position
the
ontario
attorney
general
took
no
position
and
the
manitoba
attorney
general
supported
the
law
society
justice
gonthier
noted
that
the
term
other
counselis
mentioned
in
the
immigration
act
it
is
plain
from
the
structure
of
the
act
that
this
expression
is
used
in
contradistinction
to
the
terms
barrister
and
solicitor
lawyers
are
either
barristers
or
solicitors
so
other
counselmust
mean
nonlawyers
the
judge
also
said
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
provincial
statutes
in
such
cases
the
federal
legislation
will
prevail
according
to
the
paramountcy
doctrine
in
this
case
there
is
a
conflict
between
both
statutes
the
immigration
act
authorizes
nonlawyers
to
appear
for
a
fee
whereas
the
legal
profession
act
prohibits
them
from
doing
so
dual
compliance
to
both
statutes
is
impossible
without
frustrating
parliaments
purpose
the
immigration
act
must
therefore
prevail
justice
gonthier
also
held
that
if
parliament
had
intended
to
limit
the
meaning
of
other
counsel
to
unpaid
nonlawyers
the
section
would
have
been
drafted
differently
