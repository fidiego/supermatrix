the
immigration
issue
is
on
the
move
at
last
future
historians
will
wonder
what
took
it
so
long
we
are
transforming
ourselves
immigration
and
naturalization
service
commissioner
doris
meissner
has
said
approvingly
but
no
one
bothered
to
consult
we
this
fall
however
bills
authored
by
both
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
and
rep
lamar
smith
rtex
mark
an
historic
watershed
both
propose
the
first
reduction
in
the
legal
influx
since
the
1965
immigration
act
restarted
mass
immigration
quite
accidentally
after
the
fourdecade
midcentury
lull
official
washington
is
used
to
being
told
that
it
is
out
of
touch
with
the
rest
of
the
country
but
on
the
immigration
issue
professional
politicians
are
showing
a
touching
bipartisan
willingness
to
get
it
even
president
clinton
initially
endorsed
the
findings
of
the
recent
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
liberal
congresswoman
barbara
jordan
which
concluded
in
effect
that
the
system
was
broke
and
that
legal
immigration
should
be
reduced
the
problem
is
what
might
be
called
the
political
intelligentsia
reporters
and
media
commentators
assorted
policy
wonks
and
ideologues
in
foundations
and
universities
by
continuing
to
bang
the
drum
for
the
glories
of
immigration
in
principle
rather
than
facing
the
anomalies
of
immigration
in
practice
this
powerful
group
can
intimidate
the
professional
politicians
and
ensure
that
the
national
debate
in
key
respects
remains
paralyzed
by
emotion
combined
with
the
usual
ethnic
and
specialinterest
lobbying
this
means
theres
still
a
significant
chance
that
real
immigration
reform
will
not
in
the
end
be
passed
by
this
congress
the
marks
of
this
paralysis
can
already
be
seen
in
the
current
proposals
both
the
bills
and
the
jordan
commission
have
considerable
difficulty
in
figuring
out
a
practical
way
to
reduce
the
legal
immigration
numbers
in
1994
there
were
about
800000
legal
immigrants
not
counting
150000
asylum
applicants
most
of
whom
will
never
leave
major
portions
of
the
current
influx
reunification
of
close
family
members
and
refugees
have
been
assumed
to
be
sacrosanct
for
years
any
discussion
of
reducing
legal
immigration
was
smothered
with
the
blanket
accusation
of
racism
because
the
1965
act
had
effectively
choked
off
europe
and
skewed
admissions
to
a
handful
of
countries
in
the
third
world
now
that
this
restriction
is
finally
being
debated
any
effort
to
make
it
substantive
is
met
with
another
accusation
meanspiritedness
who
after
all
could
possibly
be
against
reuniting
families
one
result
is
that
current
proposals
are
forced
to
freeze
or
cut
the
already
small
skilled
immigration
category
which
constitutes
about
15
percent
of
legal
immigration
but
this
is
the
only
type
of
immigration
that
can
be
shown
to
be
of
economic
benefit
to
the
american
nativeborn
in
a
recent
article
in
the
journal
of
economic
perspectives
prof
george
j
borjas
of
the
university
of
california
san
diego
estimated
the
benefit
to
nativeborn
americans
from
the
presence
of
nearly
20
million
immigrants
is
nugatory
maybe
onetenth
of
one
percent
of
gdp
because
the
influx
has
been
so
unskilled
and
threatening
skilled
immigration
is
bound
to
galvanize
blind
business
opposition
to
any
reform
herewith
some
meanspirited
thoughts
why
should
the
policy
of
close
family
reunification
be
regarded
as
unquestionable
these
families
were
not
broken
up
by
some
natural
disaster
one
spouse
simply
came
here
voluntarily
the
family
could
be
reunited
by
that
spouse
returning
home
moreover
some
of
these
families
were
never
united
in
the
first
place
an
immigrant
who
after
immigration
selects
a
spouse
from
back
in
the
old
country
benefits
from
the
reunification
preference
too
indeed
this
must
also
be
happening
in
the
highest
preference
category
for
immigration
spouses
and
minor
children
of
american
citizens
about
200000
in
1994
sounds
romantic
yank

oxford
marries
indian
maharajah
but
in
fact
some
proportion
of
that
inflow
is
due
not
to
nativeborn
americans
but
to
immigrants
who
have
simply
graduated
to
citizenship
by
fulfilling
the
fiveyear
waiting
period
and
other
minimal
requirements
and
then
imported
a
family
how
many
as
usual
no
one
knows
but
assuming
naturalized
citizens
sponsor
close
family
members
at
about
the
same
rate
as
legal
permanent
residents
it
could
easily
be
half
obviously
naturalized
are
not
on
the
same
moral
footing
as
nativeborn
citizens
when
it
comes
to
importing
spouses
the
law
should
distinguish
between
them
for
that
matter
what
about
the
moral
footing
of
much
of
that
backlog
for
spouses
and
children
of
permanent
residents
an
estimated
80
percent
of
them
are
sponsored
by
the
illegal
immigrants
who
were
amnestied
under
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
under
the
jordan
proposal
these
amnestied
illegals
are
to
be
rewarded
for
a
second
time
for
breaking
american
law
and
why
should
the
united
states
take
in
refugees
its
the
american
tradition
is
the
standard
reply
but
its
not
the
1798
alien
and
sedition
acts
were
passed
partly
because
of
fear
of
refugees
from
the
french
revolution
historically
few
immigrants
have
come
to
america
as
a
result
of
political
disruption
at
home
contrary
to
myth
there
was
no
explicit
recognition
of
refugees
in
us
law
until
select
groups
were
admitted
after
world
war
ii
the
united
states
did
not
acquire
a
comprehensive
refugee
policy
until
the
1980
refugee
act
the
idea
that
the
united
states
should
be
sort
of
an
international
kleenex
mopping
up
the
blood
spilled
in
foreign
conflicts
is
completely
new
in
reality
the
refugee
program
is
a
subsidized
expedited
immigration
program
for
politically
favored
groups
for
example
about
40
percent
of
the
110000
refugees
in
1994
came
from
the
former
soviet
union
mostly
jews
whom
the
united
states
is
obliged
to
accept
automatically
as
refugees
along
with
ukrainian
catholics
and
pentecostals
under
the
socalled
lautenberg
amendment
almost
none
of
these
were
from
the
2
million
people
displaced
by
postcommunist
conflicts
in
the
former
soviet
union
and
identified
as
refugees
by
the
united
nations
these
refugees
are
immediately
eligible
for
welfare
and
tend
to
stay
on
it
welfare
participation
among
exsoviets
is
more
than
16
percent
compared
to
about
7
percent
for
nativeborn
americans
according
to
borjas
ironically
immigration
enthusiasts
often
cite
this
in
excusing
the
high
immigrant
welfare
participation
rate
9
percent
overall
somehow
they
never
suggest
abolishing
the
refugee
category
altogether
such
unsentimental
questioning
of
immigration
policy
does
not
sound
nice
but
after
a
30year
immigration
binge
the
united
states
is
running
out
of
nice
options
hence
the
ultimate
meanspirited
thought
whose
country
is
it
anyway
immigration
is
a
classic
example
of
the
type
of
policy
where
a
and
b
get
together
to
decide
what
c
should
do
for
d
in
this
case
c
is
our
children
and
d
is
a
group
of
foreigners
if
the
transformation
of
america
continues
our
children
will
bear
the
brunt
which
suggests
a
new
definition
of
mean
spirited
person
in
immigration
policy
one
who
considers
the
national
interest
