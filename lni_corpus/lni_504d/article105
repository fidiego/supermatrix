the
justice
department
on
tuesday
filed
a
lawsuit
challenging
utahs
immigration
law
saying
it
illegally
attempts
to
establish
a
statespecific
immigration
policy
and
creates
immigration
enforcement
measures
that
interfere
with
the
priorities
and
practices
of
the
federal
government
the
lawsuit
is
the
fourth
brought
by
the
department
against
states
that
have
recently
passed
legislation
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
in
the
wake
of
complaints
that
the
federal
government
was
not
doing
the
job
the
others
are
arizona
alabama
and
south
carolina
a
patchwork
of
immigration
laws
is
not
the
answer
and
will
only
create
further
problems
in
our
immigration
system
said
attorney
general
eric
h
holder
jr
the
federal
government
is
the
chief
enforcer
of
immigration
laws
and
while
we
appreciate
cooperation
from
states
which
remains
important
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
set
its
own
immigration
policy
in
the
suit
the
department
said
the
utah
law
enacted
in
march
clearly
violates
the
constitution
since
its
enforcement
would
interfere
with
the
federal
government
in
a
way
which
is
not
cooperative
with
the
primary
federal
role
in
this
area
the
utah
law
gives
limited
authority
to
state
and
local
police
to
check
immigration
status
for
people
lawfully
stopped
detained
or
arrested
for
misdemeanors
and
felonies
it
also
requires
that
people
arrested
on
felony
counts
must
prove
their
citizenship
the
federal
suit
said
utahs
mandates
on
law
enforcement
could
lead
to
harassment
and
detention
of
foreign
visitors
and
legal
immigrants
now
in
the
process
of
having
their
immigration
status
reviewed
in
federal
proceedings
and
whom
the
federal
government
has
permitted
to
stay
in
the
us
while
the
proceedings
are
pending
the
federal
government
according
to
the
suit
has
the
ultimate
authority
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
and
the
constitution
does
not
permit
a
patchwork
of
local
immigration
policies
homeland
security
secretary
janet
a
napolitano
whose
department
joined
justice
and
state
in
the
lawsuit
said
the
utah
law
was
representative
of
the
kind
of
legislation
that
diverts
critical
law
enforcement
resources
from
the
most
serious
threats
to
public
safety
and
undermines
the
vital
trust
between
local
jurisdictions
and
the
communities
they
serve
the
department
will
continue
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
in
utah
in
smart
effective
ways
that
focus
our
resources
on
criminal
aliens
recent
border
crossers
repeat
and
egregious
immigration
law
violators
and
employers
who
knowingly
hire
illegal
labor
she
said
justice
previously
challenged
laws
passed
in
arizona
alabama
and
south
carolina
on
federal
preemption
grounds
and
said
it
will
continue
to
review
immigration
related
laws
passed
in
indiana
and
georgia
courts
have
enjoined
key
parts
of
the
arizona
alabama
georgia
and
indiana
state
laws
and
temporarily
restrained
enforcement
of
utahs
law
