charles

adjunct
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
georgia
and
past
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
there
is
no
surprise
in
the
obama
administrations
lawsuit
to
stop
enforcement
of
arizonas
immigration
law
sb
1070
president
obama
must
defend
federal
authority
to
act
exclusively
on
immigration
law
the
supreme
court
has
long
held
that
states
cannot
impinge
on
federal
authority
unless
those
state
laws
are
consistent
with
federal
law
arizonas
sb
1070
is
not
consistent
with
federal
law
despite
protestations
to
the
contrary
sb
1070
goes
far
beyond
that
1940
law
on
which
it
claims
to
be
based
and
which
was
designed
to
round
up
japanese
german
and
other
enemies
in
a
time
of
war
everyone
understands
the
frustrations
associated
with
undocumented
immigration
but
the
obama
administration
nor
any
administration
cannot
tolerate
50
different
states
passing
50
different
state
laws
on
a
federal
issue
like
immigration
it
is
already
a
nightmare
in
the
context
of
everify
if
president
obama
does
not
act
he
gives
tacit
approval
to
the
notion
that
states
can
pass
conflicting
and
impossible
to
fairly
enforce
immigrationrelated
laws
by
going
to
federal
court
he
signals
that
sb
1070
encroaches
on
federal
immigration
law
faced
with
this
choice
there
is
no
choice
at
all
no
da
king
president
of
the
georgiabased
dustin
inman
society
which
advocates
enforcement
of
american
immigration
laws
joining
the
aclu
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
and
a
host
of
other
professional
antienforcement
hucksters
the
obama
administration
is
defining
itself
on
immigration
obama
is
challenging
the
right
of
the
sovereign
state
of
arizona
to
reduce
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
through
enforcement
of
the
law
essentially
the
same
law
the
feds
refuse
to
honor
the
next
headline
could
well
be
that
someone
in
the
obama
white
house
has
finally
actually
read
arizonas
support
our
law
enforcement
and
safe
neighborhoods
act
absent
any
credible
attempt
to
secure
american
borders
or
enforce
our
immigration
and
employment
laws
the
administration
obviously
fears
the
change
currently
taking
place
in
a
border
state
with
the
yes
we
can
attitude
on
illegal
immigration
illegal
aliens
are
already
migrating
out
of
arizona
because
of
the
threatened
enforcement
it
is
clear
that
the
same
will
happen
in
other
states
that
have
moved
toward
similar
laws
that
is
the
great
concern
for
obama
enforcement
works
americans
should
hope
that
obamas
transparent
lawsuit
doesnt
loaddate
