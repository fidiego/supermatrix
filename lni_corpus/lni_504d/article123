mulls
arizonastyle
immigration
crackdown
georgia
could
become
the
next
legal
and
political
flashpoint
over
illegal
immigration
if
it
adopts
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
but
supporters
of

its
little
wonder
that
the
republicandominated
georgia
legislature
waited
until
the
closing
days
of
its
session
to
take
up
hb
87
an
immigration
reform
law
inspired
by
arizonas
controversial
move
last
year
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigrants
two
tidal
forces
within
the
republican
party
are
pulling
at
the
georgia
bill
which
has
to
be
resolved
by
a
thursday
midnight
deadline
on
one
side
are
lawandorder
republicans
who
form
the
partys
urban
and
suburban
base
reacting
to
fears
that
illegal
immigrants
are
in
essence
part
of
a
large
criminal
cartel
that
siphons
off
billions
in
taxpayerfunded
entitlements
every
year
on
the
other
are
state
farmers
and
agribusinesses
many
of
them
financial
supporters
of
the
state
gop
who
say
the
proposed
requirements
for
them
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
their
quicklyhired
field
workers
are
too
onerous
and
could
in
the
worst
case
leave
fields
of
vidalia
onions
and
groves
of
peach
trees
unpicked
others
worry
that
hb
87
could
spark
national
boycotts
as
the
arizona
law
did
and
hurt
the

arizona

state
of
extremes
that
a
southern
agricultural
state
may
line
up
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
a
western
border
state
with
a
vastly
different
economic
and
cultural
history
shows
how
deeply
the
debate
over
what
to
do
with
americas
13
million
undocumented
residents
has
cut
into
capitol
dome
politics
the
measure
also
promises
to
test
how
a
bevy
of
new
state
immigration
proposals
will
play
in
nonborder
states
where
republicans
are
eager
to
challenge
washington
on
immigration
enforcement
and
other
perceived
excesses
and
failures
of
federal
power
what
youre
seeing
in
georgia
is
what
youre
seeing
across
the
country
where
the
demographics
of
immigration
have
changed
substantially
in
the
past
20
years
says
kevin
johnson
an
immigration
law
expert
at
the
university
of
california
at
davis
at
the
same
time
state
immigration
laws
are
a
very
difficult
political
issue
to
peg
he
says
because
theres
dissension
in
both
political
parties
over
how
to
deal
with
the
problem
bills
introduced
in
30
states
as
of
march
lawmakers
in
30
us
states
had
introduced
52
immigrationrelated
bills
many
including
language
similar
to
the
arizona
law
fourteen
of
those
measures
have
failed
and
36
are
still
pending
reports
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
so
far
utah
is
the
only
state
to
follow
arizonas
lead
utah
now
requires
police
officers
to
verify
the
residency
status
of
anyone
detained
for
a
serious
crime
conceding
immigrants
role
in
the
agriculture
economy
however
the
utah
law
provides
a
form
of
amnesty
by
making
illegals
part
of
a
new
state
guest
worker
program
though
legal
experts
say
such
a
program
needs
congressional
approval
if
passed
georgias
law
is
likely
to
look
more
like
the
one
passed
in
arizona
allowing
law
enforcement
to
question
a
persons
immigration
status
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
in
the
us
illegally
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
arizona
was
at
the
lead
of
these
measures
because
its
ground
zero
for
illegal
immigration
but
it
also
makes
sense
that
georgia
would
be
active
because
georgia
is
now
one
of
the
top
illegal
immigration
destinations
says
mark
krikorian
director
of
the
center
for
immigration

tank
that
focuses
on
the
consequences
of

and

for

society
bill
moving
toward
passage
but
the
question
over
how
tough
georgia
should
get
has
been
a
vexing
one
for
republicans
the
senate
watered
down
a
tougher
house
bill
on
monday
taking
out
a
requirement
that
all
employers
use
the
federal
everify
system
to
check
the
residency
status
of
workers
the
supreme
court
is
expected
to
hand
down
a
ruling
soon
on
whether
states
can
force
employers
to
use
everify
for
all
new
hires
the
house
threw
those
changes
out
the
next
day
sending
the
original
bill
back
to
the
senate
on
thursday
afternoon
the
bill
continued
to
move
toward
passage
according
to
senate
sources
as
legislators
debated
giving
farmers
and
businesses
a
grace
period
under
which
to
comply
with
the
law
before
receiving
penalties
if
passed
the
georgia
law
is
likely
to
meet
immediate
legal
scrutiny
on
monday
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
joined
other
federal
appeals
courts
including
the
3rd
and
10th
in
shooting
down
local
preemption
of
federal
immigration
laws
the
9th
circuit
in
san
francisco
found
that
the
arizona
law
sb
1070
went
too
far
by
giving
police
new
powers
to
demand
identification
from
suspects
and
sided
with
a
lower
court
ruling
that
the
law
treads
on
federal
jurisdictions
by
establishing
state
criminal
penalties
for
immigrationrelated
crimes
like
the
arizona
law
the
georgia
bill
also
creates
new
criminal
categories
related
to
illegal
immigration
including
making
the
harboring
of
an
illegal
immigrant
a
crime
fears
of
mexican
cartels
for
many
georgians
the
bill
addresses
growing
fears
about
mexican
cartels
using
local
immigrant
communities
as
cover
for
drugtrafficking
and
in
the
process
bringing
the
bloody
mexican
drug
wars
closer
to
home
announcing

600
arrests
as
part
of
operation
southern

focused

cities
including
atlanta
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
director
john
morton
said
in
early
march
these
people
are
up
to
the
worst
sort
of
violent
crimes
in
the
communities
they
live
in
these
guys
arent
in
book
clubs
theyre
in
violent
street
gangs
the
cartel
issue
is
what
drives
fears
and
theyre
not
irrational
or
groundless
says
mr
krikorian
critics
of
state
immigration
crackdowns
however
point
out
that
the
obama
administration
has
taken
action
to
resolve
complaints
about
federal
immigration
enforcement
especially
when
dealing
with
violent
criminals
the
department
of
homeland
security
deported
more
illegal
immigrants
last
year
more
than
400000
than
any
other
us
administration
in
history
another
way
to
explain
how
two
vastly
different
states
are
reaching
the
same
conclusion
on
how
to
tackle
the
social
and
economic
costs
of
illegal
immigration
is
that
such
efforts
are
in
essence
a
burgeoning
form
of
protest
by
rising
republican
majorities
in
the
states
as
conservatives
tease
out
themes
and
policies
likely
to
pay
dividends
in
the
2012
election
its
not
a
settled
debate
on
the
right
on
thursday

a
potential
presidential
contender
said
he
opposes
the
arizonastyle
law
enforcement
provisions
that
are
part
of
an
indiana
immigration
proposal
these
laws
right
now
are
more
symbolic
than
real
