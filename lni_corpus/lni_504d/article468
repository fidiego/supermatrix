it
is
the
weekend
before
the
elections
and
immigration
the
source
of
much
national
angst
in
years
past
has
disappeared
from
the
election
debate
although
not
from
lawmakers
political
agendas
in
the
past
year
or
so
while
the
nation
has
focused
on
the
white
house
and
wall
street
congress
has
quietly
scaled
back
some
provisions
of
several
1996
laws
that
were
written
to
discourage
immigration
by
cutting
a
range
of
benefits
to
legal
residents
and
stepping
up
deportation
efforts
the
moves
capped
by
proimmigration
provisions
in
this
years
budget
bill
signal
lawmakers
awareness
of
the
growing
voting
power
of
immigrants
a
couple
of
years
ago
people
were
advocating
to
build
a
wall
around
the
country
said
senator
spencer
abraham
a
michigan
republican
who
introduced
several
proimmigration
provisions
in
this
years
spending
bill
thats
no
longer
the
case
before
we
had
heard
only
one
side
of
the
immigration
issue
now
we
get
to
talk
about
some
of
the
positive
contributions
immigrants
have
made
the
immigration
measures
in
the
budget
bill
that
president
clinton
signed
allowing
almost
50000
haitian
refugees
to
stay
in
the
country
for
example
and
increasing
the
number
of
visas
granted
to
foreign
professionals
would
have
been
unthinkable
four
years
ago
when
antiimmigration
themes
dominated
political
campaigns
nationally
or
two
years
ago
when
congress
passed
what
many
consider
the
most
antiimmigrant
legislation
in
decades
no
one
is
suggesting
that
congress
is
dismantling
those
laws
particularly
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigrant
responsibility
act
of
1996
indeed
now
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
is
flush
with
money
most
of
the
harsher
measures
of
that
law
are
being
enforced
still
there
seems
to
be
a
growing
consensus
among
lawmakers
that
too
much
control
of
immigration
is
not
good
for
politicians
who
recognize
that
immigrants
votes
could
be
pivotal
in
some
races
for
businesses
and
the
economy
because
valued
employees
have
had
to
return
home
and
prospective
hires
have
not
been
granted
visas
or
even
for
the
government
itself
since
control
is
expensive
and
time
consuming
those
assumptions
coupled
with
good
economic
news
have
led
some
anti
immigration
members
of
congress
to
take
a
cautious
approach
to
immigration
issues
or
ignore
them
the
republicans
are
taking
a
waitandsee
attitude
said
representative
luis
gutierrez
an
illinois
democrat
who
is
proimmigration
they
dont
want
to
offend
one
side
or
alienate
the
other
among
some
lawmakers
especially
those
who
advocate
a
hard
line
against
immigrants
there
is
a
sense
that
the
laws
of
1996
were
so
sweeping
that
very
little
more
can
be
done
or
added
to
the
debate
the
budget
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
much
of
it
dedicated
to
enforcement
now
surpasses
that
of
the
fbi
and
the
agency
has
more
employees
than
either
the
department
of
state
or
labor
the
clinton
administration
took
some
major
steps
showing
that
it
was
serious
in
trying
to
control
illegal
immigration
said
t
alexander
aleinikoff
a
law
professor
at
georgetown
university
and
former
general
counsel
and
associate
commissioner
of
the
immigration
service
some
people
are
saying
weve
dealt
with
the
problem
weve
done
what
we
can
lets
move
on
but
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
is
far
from
resolved
mr
aleinikoff
said
there
are
about
five
million
such
immigrants
in
the
united
states
and
no
law
that
specifically
addresses
what
to
do
with
them
instead
lawmakers
are
sidestepping
immigration
in
their
campaigns
and
have
been
passing
legislation
that
benefits
immigrants
and
in
some
cases
reverses
aspects
of
previous
laws
congress
has
restored
most
of
the
welfare
benefits
it
took
away
from
legal
immigrants
in
1996
lawmakers
also
restored
some
of
the
protections
that
central
american
immigrants
had
lost
therefore
sparing
them
from
deportation
congress
granted
amnesty
to
150000
nicaraguans
5000
cubans
and
49700
haitians
and
allowed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
who
hope
to
gain
permanent
visas
to
stay
in
the
united
states
instead
of
having
to
go
home
to
file
their
applications
as
the
1996
law
dictated
congress
granted
171
million
to
the
immigration
agency
to
speed
the
naturalization
process
and
for
the
first
time
in
years
it
increased
by
5000
the
number
of
refugees
allowed
into
the
country
every
year
the
pendulum
is
definitely
swinging
our
way
said
judith
e
golub
director
of
advocacy
for
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
in
washington
advocates
for
immigrants
as
well
as
those
who
oppose
immigration
say
the
pendulum
began
to
swing
in
favor
of
immigrants
four
years
ago
the
reelection
of
californias
governor
pete
wilson
who
won
in
part
by
making
his
antiimmigration
platform
part
of
the
national
debate
was
a
signal
to
immigrants
everywhere
that
unless
they
quickly
became
united
states
citizens
they
too
would
feel
the
impact
of
measures
like
proposition
187
the
proposition
is
a
california
ballot
initiative
seeking
to
deny
education
health
and
other
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
many
rushed
to
naturalize
and
thousands
of
new
citizens
were
ready
to
vote
in
the
1996
races
the
results
caught
the
republicans
by
surprise
in
california
a
newcomer
to
politics
loretta
sanchez
a
democrat
unseated
the
republican
incumbent
representative
robert
k
dornan
pete
wilson
brought
out
the
angry
white
male
in
california
and
used
immigration
as
a
hotbutton
issue
to
get
reelected
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
that
brought
out
the
angry
new
citizen
in
record
numbers
to
vote
and
punish
the
republican
party
shortly
afterward
republicans
began
to
change
their
tune
speaker
newt
gingrich
set
the
tone
by
pledging
that
his
party
would
reach
out
to
hispanic
people
and
members
of
other
minorities
he
hired
an
aide
to
oversee
this
effort
and
his
office
began
releasing
information
translated
into
spanish
and
now
running
hard
against
ms
sanchez
again
mr
dornan
is
calling
himself
a
friend
of
hispanic
immigrants
in
texas
gov
george
wbush
a
republican
popular
with
hispanic
immigrants
who
is
seeking
reelection
is
spending
more
money
to
attract
hispanic
voters
than
any
other
politician
ever
his
campaign
advisers
said
advocates
for
immigrants
point
to
senator
abrahams
appointment
as
the
chairman
of
the
senate
subcommittee
on
immigration
as
a
turning
point
he
replaced
senator
alan
simpson
a
republican
from
wyoming
who
retired
two
years
ago
with
representative
lamar
smith
a
republican
from
texas
mr
simpson
was
the
architect
of
some
of
the
more
restrictive
of
the
1996
antiimmigration
laws
mr
simpson
did
not
return
phone
calls
mr
smith
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
said
in
a
statement
the
passage
of
a
haitian
amnesty
reflects
yearend
budget
deal
making
and
not
any
change
of
heart
in
congress
there
was
little
support
in
the
house
for
amnesty
because
it
will
set
a
bad
precedent
and
undermines
longstanding
immigration
policy
