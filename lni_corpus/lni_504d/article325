loose
on
the
streets
of
america
hiding
from
federal
immigration
authorities
despite
the
creation
of
a
new
agency
to
hunt
down
criminal
aliens
and
the
infusion
of
millions
of
dollars
to
get
the
job
done
many
state
and
local
police
agencies
who
make
contact
with
the
aliens
either
never
learn
of
their
immigration
status
or
never
advise
the
federal

of
their

at
a
time
when
our
officers
are
faced
with
arresting
and
rearresting
the
same
80000
criminal
aliens
over
and
over
again
we
should
be
giving
them
greater
access
to
data
and
more
resources
making
matters
more
difficult
for
federal
authorities
are
several
municipalities
that
have
passed
ordinances
prohibiting
their
employees
including
police
officers
from
enforcing
federal
immigration
laws
known
as
sanctuary
laws
the
ordinances
are
in
place
in
varying
degree
in
major
cities
such
as
los
angeles
san
francisco
and
houston
immigration
opponents
argue
that
the
laws
encourage
illegal
immigration
some
including
the
districtbased
federation
of
american
immigration
reform
have
charged
that
sanctuary
laws
offer
shelter
for
wouldbe
terrorists
by
allowing
illegal
immigrants
to
establish
themselves
as
residents
the
friends
of
immigration
law
enforcement
file
also
based
in
the
district
has
begun
to
bring
lawsuits
against
those
municipalities
with
sanctuary
ordinances
and
has
promised
additional
legal
challenges
file
has
argued
that
state
and
county
governments
are
prohibited
from
adopting
policies
that
prevent
its
employees
from
contacting
federal
immigration
authorities
about
the
legal
status
of
any
noncitizen
or
to
report
violations
of
us
immigration
law
by
any
noncitizen
these
policies
called
sanctuary
policies
promise
foreign
nationals
who
have
broken
our
laws
that
the
municipality
in
which
they
live
will
help
them
in
their
lawbreaking
by
resisting
efforts
to
report
them
to
the
proper
authorities
file
said
in
a
statement
such
policies
are
illegal
naturally
and
have
been
rejected
by
the
courts
nevertheless
some
cities
remarkably
persist
in
maintaining
their
illegal
sanctuary
policies
file
said
unfortunately
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
has
been
for
many
years
utterly
derelict
in
forcing
as
is
its
duty
municipalities
to
abide
by
the
law
the
national
council
of
la
raza
has
defended
sanctuary
laws
saying
that
collaboration
between
federal
authorities
and
state
and
local
municipalities
is
contrary
to
us
case
law
and
that
it
results
in
racial
profiling
police
misconduct
and
civil
rights
violations
la
raza
also
charges
that
it
undermines
community
policing
efforts
and
that
it
undercuts
effective
lawenforcement
and
antiterrorism
efforts
by
diverting
resources
and
leading
to
additional
litigation
mr
norwood
has
introduced
the
clear
law
enforcement
for
alien
removal
act
that
would
among
other
things
give
state
and
local
police
agencies
authority
to
enforce
immigration
laws
the
pending
bill
with
112
cosponsors
of
both
parties
also
would
grant
state
and
local
police
agencies
access
to
the
national
criminal
information
center
ncic
database
for
immigration
status
information
last
month
several
proimmigration
and
civil
rights
groups
filed
a
classaction
lawsuit
to
stop
the
government
from
entering
immigration
information
into
ncic
saying
the
data
was
being
misused
in
the
wake
of
the
september
11
attacks
filed
in
us
district
court
in
new
york
the
suit
said
the
justice
department
unlawfully
entered
immigration
information
into
ncic
subjecting
immigrants
to
the
risk
of
unlawful
arrest
by
state
and
local
police
the
suit
also
questioned
the
authority
of
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
to
enlist
state
and
local
police
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
the

show
up

it
also
includes
thousands
of
immigrants
