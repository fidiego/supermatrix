down
on
socalled
sanctuary
cities
or
places
where

choose
not

enforce
immigration
policy

creating
the
new
112th
congress
immigration
reform
caucus
which
will
closely
examine
american
immigration
policy
and
come
up
with
ways
to
prevent
illegal
immigration
the
american
people
sent
me
here
last
november
to
fix
washington
they
sent
me
here
to
fix
our
broken
system
i
know
im
not
alone
in
that
all
across
the
country
the
american
people
voted
in
new
members
of
congress
and
gave
them
the
same
order
fix
whats
broken
he
said
barletta
who
announced
his
plans
at
a
capitol
news
conference
wednesday
said
he
has
not
signed
up
anyone
to
join
his
caucus
and
acknowledged
that
congress
already
has
an
immigration
caucus
but
he
said
his
caucus
is
exclusively
for
freshmen
this
is
going
to
give
freshmen
a
platform
and
bring
some
fresh
ideas
he
said
immigration
law
is
overseen
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
whose
chairman
is
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
the
other
immigration
caucus
is
headed
by
brian
billbray
rcalif
barlettas
first
bill
tentatively
known
as
the
mobilizing
against
sanctuary
cities
act
will
withhold
federal
funding
from
cities
whose
elected
officials
have
willfully
chosen
not
to
enforce
immigration
policy
the
congressional
research
service
a
nonpartisan
agency
that
provides
support
to
congress
has
described
such
places
as
having
adopted
dont
ask
dont
tell
policies
in
which
city
employees
including
police
personnel
are
not
required
to
report
illegal
immigrants
to
federal
authorities
i
feel
that
i
am
standing
up
for
the
millions
of
americans
who
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
and
also
for
the
legal
immigrants
who
followed
the
rule
of
law
to
come
to
america
barletta
said
he
asked
the
research
service
to
compile
a
list
of
the
cities
and
calculate
the
amount
of
federal
taxpayer
dollars
each
receives
more
than
100
cities
have
forbidden
their
police
from
asking
someones
immigration
status
or
providing
information
on
illegal
immigration
to
the
federal
government
they
include
philadelphia
new
york
san
diego
san
francisco
chicago
baltimore
new
orleans
and
new
haven
conn
in
some
cases
mayors
have
said
they
do
not
want
police
spending
their
time
on
a
federal
matter
illegal
immigration
when
other
crimes
are
more
important
in
others
mayors
have
backed
the
desire
of
large
latino
populations
who
do
not
want
relatives
ensnared
in
immigration
raids
barletta
said
he
considers
the
sanctuary
cities
in
violation
of
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
responsibility
act
of
1996
that
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
state
or
local
government
to
prohibit
their
employees
from
sharing
information
about
illegal
aliens
with
the
federal
government
they
should
not
receive
millions
or
even
billions
in
tax
dollars
as
a
reward
barletta
said
while
announcing
his
plans
barletta
noted
that
lawsuits
were
filed
against
hazleton
and
arizona
for
trying
to
uphold
federal
immigration
policy
if
the
federal
government
wants
to
sue
the
state
of
arizona
because
it
claims
the
state
is
breaking
federal
law
then
it
should
also
sue
the
mayors
of
sanctuary
cities
because
they
are
willfully
breaking
federal
immigration
law
he
said
word
of
barlettas
initiatives
came
almost
five
years
after
hazleton
city
council
adopted
the
illegal
immigration
relief
act
or
iira
an
ordinance
that
gained
national
attention
for
its
tough
stance
on
illegal
immigration
barlettas
2006
iira
was
designed
to
address
illegal
immigrants
in
hazleton
but
the
law
has
never
been
enforced
he
introduced
it
after
illegal
immigrants
were
arrested
hours
apart
for
incidents
involving
a
gun
fired
at
a
city
playground
and
the
murder
of
a
man
outside
his
chestnut
street
home
the
law
would
have
penalized
businesses
that
employ
illegal
immigrants
and
landlords
who
rent
to
them
it
also
made
english
the
citys
official
language
city
council
backed
the
plan
and
supporters
said
it
tackled
a
problem
congress
had
failed
to
address
opponents
however
said
the
act
violated
peoples
rights
the
american
civil
liberties
union
or
aclu
and
others
challenged
the
law
in
us
district
court
in
scranton
where
a
judge
ruled
the
act
was
unconstitutional
the
city
appealed
the
decision
in
third
circuit
court
in
philadelphia
but
the
ruling
there
also
went
against
hazleton
soon
after
being
elected
in
november
barletta
called
congress
the
best
place
to
address
immigration
a
place
where
it
needed
to
be
fixed
in
the
first
place
while
barletta
establishes
his
initiatives
in
washington
hazletons
iira
is
still
being
considered
for
review
by
the
us
supreme
court
mayor
joseph
yannuzzi
said
they
have
to
make
a
final
decision
he
said
the
court
will
decide
whether
it
will
hear
the
case
or
it
can
send
it
back
to
the
third
circuit
court
yannuzzi
expects
the
decision
will
come
any
day
now
if
the
decision
is
not
in
hazletons
favor
yannuzzi
said
he
hopes
donations
will
roll
in
to
the
citys
legal
defense
fund
so
it
can
continue
to
pursue
the
matter
g
terry
madonna
director
of
the
center
for
politics
and
public
affairs
at
franklin
marshall
college
in
lancaster
said
he
is
somewhat
surprised
with
barlettas
pursuit
of
the
illegal
immigration
issue
he
did
not
make
a
big
deal
of
this
issue
when
he
was
running
for
congress
last
year
madonna
said
it
was
not
a
central
feature
of
his
campaign
instead
barlettas
campaign
focused
on
his
opponents
record
and
the
recession
madonna
said
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
it
comes
up
now
but
given
what
he
had
when
he
was
a
mayor
it
was
certainly
something
to
be
expected
