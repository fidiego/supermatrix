the
government
has
named
border
patrol
agents
investigators
deportation
officers
and
other
enforcement
personnel
to
review
applications
from
illegal
aliens
seeking
legal
status
under
the
new
immigration
law
the
assignments
have
caused
concern
among
immigration
lawyers
hispanic
groups
and
religious
organizations
which
fear
that
some
of
the
officials
because
of
their
lawenforcement
background
will
be
hostile
to
aliens
immigration
officials
said
that
the
fears
were
unfounded
and
that
data
submitted
on
applications
for
legal
status
would
not
be
used
to
deport
illegal
aliens
the
law
requires
that
such
information
be
kept
confidential
unless
an
alien
has
knowingly
made
false
statements
in
an
application
the
law
of
the
land
however
the
officials
acknowledged
that
the
law
would
require
major
changes
in
attitude
for
many
employees
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
the
success
of
the
law
depends
on
such
changes

experts
said

a
180degree
change
mr
heitzmann
said

a
problem

to
uphold
it

to
be
headed
by
bruce
chadbourne
who
was
a
deportation
officer
until
a
few
months
ago
the
manager
of
the
legalization
office
in
manhattan
jack
byrnes
was
until
recently
a
supervisor
of
investigations
who
specialized
in
detecting

29
years
in
the
immigration
service
serving
as
a
border
patrol
agent
intelligence
officer
investigator
and
associate
regional
commissioner
for
enforcement
among
other
jobs
he
said
his
goal
now
was
to
legalize
as
many
aliens
as
possible
sam
bernsen
an
immigration
lawyer
said
the
selection
of
enforcement
personnel
to
run
the
legalization
program
was
a
mistake
these
people
are
likely
to
be
perceived
as
hostile
to
illegal
aliens
said
mr
bernsen
who
worked
at
the
immigration
service
for
more
than
35
years
in
various
jobs
including
general
counsel
as
a
result
aliens
will
be
apprehensive
and
may
be
afraid
to
apply
charles
c
foster
of
houston
a
former
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
said
a
person
who
has
spent
his
life
trying
to
detect
detain
and
deport
aliens
will
have
mixed
feelings
about
trying
to
administer
the
legalization
program
in
a
generous
fashion
as
congress
intended
richard
e
norton
associate
commissioner
of
the
immigration
service
said
the
people
running
the
program
understand
that
the
ins
has
different
missions
and
wears
different
hats
many
have
experience
serving
the
public
and
reviewing
aliens
applications
for
citizenship
or
other
benefits
he
said
new
law
offers
amnesty
a
federal
advisory
committee
that
studied
immigration
policy
said
in
1981
that
the
public
service
and
lawenforcement
functions
of
the
ins
should
be
separated
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
but
that
has
not
occurred
the
new
law
prohibits
employers
from
hiring
illegal
aliens
but
offers
legal
status
or
amnesty
to
illegal
aliens
who
entered
the
united
states
before
jan
1
1982
and
have
resided
here
continuously
since
then
the
application
period
lasts
to
may
4
1988
the
government
expects
applications
from
four
million
illegal
aliens
under
the
program
illegal
aliens
may
become
lawful
temporary
residents
of
the
united
states
after
18
months
in
that
status
they
may
apply
for
permanent
residence
after
five
years
as
permanent
residents
they
may
apply
for
united
states
citizenship
in
preparing
their
applications
many
illegal
aliens
will
receive
help
from
nonprofit
groups
like
the
united
states
catholic
conference
the
social
action
arm
of
the
roman
catholic
church
gilbert
paul
carrasco
an
immigration
lawyer
at
the
catholic
conference
said
he
had
very
serious
concern
that
immigration
officials
would
maintain
their
lawenforcement
perspective
in
the
legalization
program
problems
of
documentation
this
is
a
benefits
program
and
is
supposed
to
be
liberally
construed
he
said
the
law
will
require
a
major
psychological
change
for
many
aliens
too
after
living
in
the
united
states
for
years
as
undocumented
workers
trying
to
conceal
their
illegal
status
they
must
now
find
documents
to
prove
they
have
been
here
in
an
unlawful
status
since
1982
muzaffar
a
chishti
a
lawyer
with
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
said
that
thousands
of
illegal
aliens
would
have
severe
problems
finding
the
necessary
documents
in
the
needle
trades
he
said
many
aliens
worked
in
sweatshops
for
flybynight
operators
who
paid
them
in
cash
so
there
are
no
pay
stubs
paychecks
or
other
records
