to
the
federal

new
haven
conn
in
some
cases
mayors

matter
illegal
immigration
when
other
crimes
are
more
important
in

mr

said
he
considers
the
sanctuary
cities
in
violation
of
illegal
immigration
reform
and
responsibility
act
of
1996
that
makes
it
a
crime
for
any
state
or
local
government
to
prohibit
their
employees
from
sharing
information
about
illegal
aliens
with
the
federal

when
i
was
the
mayor
of
hazleton
i
was
sued
because
i
tried
to
uphold
federal
immigration
policy
the
state
of
arizona
was
sued
by
the
federal
government
for
trying
to
uphold
federal
immigration
policy
he
said
according
to
text
prepared
for
his
news
conference
yet
the
elected
officials
of
more
than
a
hundred
american
cities
including
some
of
our
largest
cities
in
the
country
willfully
ignore
federal
immigration
policy
by
declaring
themselves
sanctuary
cities
local
elected
officials
who
choose
to
ignore
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
policy
are
aiding
and
assisting
illegal
aliens
and
it
is
illegal
to
aid
and
abet
those
who
are
in
this
country
illegally
they
should
not
receive
millions
or
even
billions
in
tax
dollars
as
a
reward
mr
barletta
said
he
understands
that
getting
the
bill
will
be
an
uphill
fight
but
the
killing
of
osama
bin
laden
highlighted
again
the
danger
of
terrorism
and
unsecure
borders
could
one
day
allow
in
a
terrorist
mr
bilbray
among
others
introduced
a
bill
that
would
halve
a
sanctuary
citys
homeland
security
funding
but
the
bill
never
became
law
as
illegal
immigration
reform
of
all
kinds
stalled
in
congress
