27
over

and
sparking
a
debate
about

up
from

the

immigration
reform
and
control
act
a
law
that
granted
amnesty
to
nearly
3
million
illegal
immigrants

a
fouryear

indicate
this
years

using

to
support
their

just
confirms
that

is
at
its
highest
level
ever
said
mark
krikorian
director
of
the
washingtonbased
center
for
immigration
studies
a
thinktank
that
favors
reducing
legal
immigration
and
theres
no
reason
to
expect
this
to
slack
off
for
the
next
six
to
seven
years
at
the
national
immigration
forum
a
washington
coalition
that
lobbies
on
behalf
of
immigrants
forum
head
frank
sharry
said
this
is
just
a
temporary
increase
a
minor
blip
on
a
trend
line
that
is
going
downward
the
restrictionists
are
going
to
take
the
numbers
out
of
context
and
make
hysterical
claims
that
legal
immigration
is
out
of
control
