immigration
officials
said
wednesday
they
expect
a
huge
increase
up
to
41
in
legal
immigrants
in
1996
because
of
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
immigrants
becoming
us
citizens
news
of
the
projections
came
as
a
shock
because
legal
immigration
has
been
dropping
by
about
10
each
year
since
1992
the
senate
was
deep
into
debate
wednesday
on
an
immigrationreform
bill
that
was
largely
rewritten
based
on
clinton
administration
assurances
that
legal
immigration
is
on
a
downward
trend
advocates
of
immigration
reform
want
deep
reductions
in
legal
immigration
president
clinton
opposes
heavy
cuts
the
administration
has
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
deception
by
leaving
a
false
impression
that
decreases
would
continue
when
were
looking
at
substantial
increases
for
the
foreseeable
future
says
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
chief
house
sponsor
of
reform
efforts
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
says
the
41
increase
will
be
the
result
of
more
immigrants
becoming
citizens
and
then
bringing
their
family
members
to
the
usa
immigrants
who
become
citizens
may
bring
in
immediate
family
members
a
spouse
and
children
under
age
18
in
1995
593000
people
immigrated
to
the
usa
to
be
with
family
members
or
to
take
a
job
that
number
is
expected
to
rise
to
835000
in
1996
and
to
nearly
854000
in
1997
after
that
the
number
would
decline
hitting
729000
in
2003
according
to
the
projections
the
numbers
dont
reflect
total
legal
immigration
because
they
dont
include
refugees
and
a
few
other
types
of
immigrants
those
categories
added
up
to
127000
last
year
bringing
total
legal
immigration
to
720000
for
1995
on
wednesday
republican
advocates
of
immigration
reform
immediately
seized
the
new
projections
as
a
potential
weapon
in
their
fight
to
push
big
reductions
in
legal
immigration
through
congress
this
year
the
house
already
has
abandoned
efforts
to
reduce
immigration
the
senate
appears
to
be
headed
in
the
same
direction
the
clinton
administration
argues
that
radical
reform
is
unnecessary
because
its
policies
are
reducing
immigration
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
chief
senate
sponsor
of
reform
efforts
accused
the
administration
of
deliberate
deception
if
the
ins
had
projections
about
the
dramatic
hike
in
legal
immigration
and
did
not
release
it
to
congress
before
debate
on
the
effort
to
lower
immigration
numbers
its
actions
were
unconscionable
simpson
said
ins
officials
who
confirmed
the
projections
only
after
they
had
been
leaked
denied
that
ins
commissioner
doris
meissner
had
misled
congress
and
the
public
doris
testified
last
fall
there
would
be
an
increase
in
legal
immigration
if
naturalization
continued
to
rise
says
bob
bach
ins
associate
commissioner
for
planning
we
explained
all
this
to
the
simpson
staff
in
glorious
detail
in
1994
592000
immigrants
applied
to
become
citizens
in
1995
1021969
immigrants
applied
a
72
increase
applications
for
citizenship
shot
up
in
large
part
because
the
3
million
illegal
immigrants
legalized
under
the
1986
amnesty
law
became
eligible
to
apply
for
citizenship
bach
cautions
that
the
ins
projections
could
change
because
theyre
based
on
a
number
of
assumptions
he
says
the
increase
will
depend
on
how
fast
the
ins
processes
applications
how
many
people
get
citizenship
and
how
many
relatives
each
new
citizen
brings
to
the
united
states
