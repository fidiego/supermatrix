the
first
major
effort
in
decades
to
limit
legal
immigration
and
end
many
family
reunification
programs
suffered
a
significant
setback
in
the
senate
on
thursday
the
senate
judiciary
committee
voted
overwhelmingly
to
separate
the
sweeping
bordercontrol
bill
into
two
measures
one
with
politically
popular
measures
aimed
at
punishing
those
who
crash
americas
borders
and
one
with
more
controversial
limits
on
lawful
entry
into
the
us
the
action
will
allow
senators
to
vote
for
the
politically
safe
illegal
immigration
measures
while
opposing
the
reductions
in
legal
immigration
making
it
more
likely
that
the
yearlong
drive
to
enact
reform
will
be
confined
to
illegal
immigration
the
progress
of
the
combined
bill
has
been
watched
closely
in
the
ethnically
diverse
silicon
valley
particularly
in
the
filipino
community
the
secondlargest
in
the
nation
if
the
measures
in
the
legal
immigrant
bill
become
law
93
percent
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
filipinos
waiting
to
immigrate
many
of
them
relatives
of
filipinos
already
here
would
become
ineligible
immigration
proponents
hailed
thursdays
vote
as
a
turning
point
in
a
whitehot
immigration
debate
that
was
touched
off
by
californias
proposition
187
in
1994
and
fanned
this
year
along
the
republican
campaign
trail
where
tough
talk
on
immigration
has
been
anything
but
subtle
this
is
a
dramatic
setback
for
them
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
proimmigration
group
a
year
ago
it
looked
like
measures
to
cut
legal
immigration
by
about
onethird
were
politically
inevitable
this
vote
shows
there
is
tremendous
and
growing
opposition
to
cutting
legal
immigration
the
senate
panels
vote
to
split
the
bill
was
126
and
reflected
the
issues
unusual
political
alliances
judiciary
committee
chairman
orrin
g
hatch
rutah
supported
it
along
with
sen
edward
m
kennedy
dmass
and
many
democrats
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwy
the
immigration
subcommittee
chairman
opposed
it
as
did
sen
dianne
feinstein
dcalif
feinstein
who
has
voted
for
tough
measures
to
stem
immigration
that
she
says
threatens
to
overwhelm
california
said
the
legal
immigration
proposals
have
been
politically
sensitive
every
immigration
attorney
has
organized
all
their
clients
and
theyre
all
lobbying
she
said
so
its
tough
but
the
bottom
line
of
this
is
what
is
just
and
fair
in
a
country
that
accepts
more
immigrants
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
and
most
of
them
put
together
feinstein
said
without
the
cover
of
popular
measures
to
combat
illegal
immigration
efforts
to
curb
legal
immigration
and
perhaps
any
immigration
bill
at
all
will
be
a
difficult
sell
this
year
it
just
makes
it
much
more
speculative
as
to
whether
any
kind
of
bill
can
come
out
in
the
long
term
feinstein
said
simpson
vows
to
fight
but
simpson
indicated
he
will
continue
the
fight
for
measures
covering
both
illegal
and
legal
immigration
he
said
the
legal
immigration
measure
will
be
given
full
debate
on
the
senate
floor
where
he
is
likely
to
move
to
meld
the
measures
back
into
a
single
bill
and
advocates
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
agreed
that
while
thursdays
vote
makes
it
more
difficult
for
some
legal
immigration
changes
to
win
approval
this
year
the
task
is
not
impossible
the
issue
will
not
go
away
simpson
told
reporters
after
the
vote
it
will
not
collapse
into
the
basement
the
president
wants
to
deal
with
it
bob
dole
wants
to
deal
with
it
and
everybody
in
america
wants
to
deal
with
it
a
parallel
bill
is
moving
forward
in
the
house
which
is
scheduled
to
debate
it
next
week
where
a
previously
defeated
effort
to
split
the
bill
will
be
revived
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
favors
tougher
immigration
laws
said
the
senate
committee
caved
in
to
special
interests
who
seek
to
protect
a
system
he
said
was
out
of
control
he
called
the
vote
cowardly
obedience
to
them
betrayed
our
trust
the
move
to
split
the
bill
should
be
seen
for
what
it
is
a
transparent
effort
to
kill
muchneeded
and
widely
supported
cuts
in
the
current
flood
of
legal
immigration
stein
said
by
shirking
their
responsibility
to
the
american
public
to
reform
immigration
these
shallow
representatives
have
betrayed
our
trust
dismissed
the
wishes
of
their
constituents
and
worsened
the
growing
problem
of
overimmigration
but
cecilia
munoz
a
deputy
vice
president
of
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
hispanic
civil
rights
group
said
separate
examinations
of
the
two
immigration
bills
will
expose
the
flaws
in
proposals
to
tighten
legal
immigration
it
makes
no
sense
to
deny
american
citizens
the
right
to
live
with
their
spouses
their
kids
and
their
siblings
munoz
said
simpsons
proposal
would
cut
legal
immigration
now
at
an
annual
level
of
about
775000
by
20
percent
it
would
allow
us
citizens
to
have
their
spouses
and
minor
children
join
them
in
the
us
but
it
would
eliminate
immigration
options
for
siblings
and
most
adult
children
and
would
severely
curtail
immigration
by
parents
those
aspects
of
the
measure
have
caused
particular
concern
in
this
area
for
example
of
the
70000
unmarried
adult
sons
and
daughters
of
us
citizens
on
the
waiting
list
to
enter
the
country
50000
are
filipino
of
260000
married
sons
and
daughters
on
the
list
150000
are
filipino
illegals
debated
first
hatch
said
his
committee
will
debate
the
legal
immigration
bill
one
week
after
it
completes
work
on
the
illegal
immigration
measure
with
debate
on
the
senate
floor
scheduled
for
late
april
all
the
stuff
you
heard
here
will
come
rising
like
the
phoenix
out
of
the
ashes
on
the
floor
simpson
said
last
year
a
commission
headed
by
the
late
barbara
jordan
a
former
texas
congresswoman
called
for
cuts
in
illegal
immigration
and
president
clinton
swiftly
embraced
that
recommendation
since
then
his
administration
has
sent
mixed
signals
about
the
pace
and
details
of
immigration
reform
the
illegal
immigration
bill
would
dramatically
increase
funding
for
borderpatrol
agents
it
would
establish
an
experimental
computerized
program
to
check
the
eligibility
status
of
people
applying
for
jobs
or
public
benefits
and
it
would
make
it
easier
to
deny
entry
to
foreigners
who
seek
us
asylum
but
do
not
hold
proper
documents
