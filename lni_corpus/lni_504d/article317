it
started
out
as
a
traffic
stop
along
interstate
80
in
mercer
county
the
vehicle
pulled
over
by
state
trooper
eric
r
miller
on
dec
16
however
was
crammed
with
10
men
an
8yearold
boy
and
a
4yearold
girl
none
of
them
could
prove
they
were
legally
permitted
in
the
country
its
a
common
occurrence
for
pennsylvania
state
troopers
patrolling
that
section
of
i80
in
the
last
two
weeks
of
december
troopers
made
eight
traffic
stops
that
netted
a
total
of
37
undocumented
people
mostly
from
mexico
all
were
turned
over
to
immigration
officials
processed
and
given
dates
to
return
for
a
hearing
since
they
did
not
commit
serious
crimes
two
men
had
an
outstanding
immigration
warrant
for
their
arrests
but
if
the
past
is
any
indication
about
a
quarter
of
them
wont
show
for
court
immigration
officials
admit
there
are
problems
when
it
comes
to
finding
and
then
making
sure
undocumented
people
are
shepherded
through
the
legal
process
we
dont
shy
away
from
the
fact
that
its
a
broken
system
we
the
department
of
homeland
security
are
trying
to
restore
the
system
its
going
to
take
a
long
time
but
were
going
to
keep
hammering
away
said
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
spokesman
manny
van
pelt
immigration
officers
spent
60000
manhours
in
2003
to
locate
2357
individuals
across
the
country
who
skipped
immigration
hearings
nationally
aliens
dont
show
up
for
their
hearing
about
22
percent
of
the
time
according
to
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
an
agency
of
the
justice
department
that
oversees
immigration
court
matters
in
pennsylvania
that
number
is
26
percent

philadelphia
immigration
review
officials
said
518
people
charged
with
immigration
offenses
failed
to
appear
the
punishment
for
not
showing
is
severe
but
it
also
presents
a
catch22
the
immigrant
will
be
deported
but
only
if
hes
caught
law
enforcement
officials
have
no
way
of
knowing
if
the
illegals
they
stop
are
criminals
in
their
home
countries
they
can
be
identified
and
tracked
by
fingerprints
once
they
are
taken
into
custody
in
the
united
states
in
pennsylvania
state
police
come
across
the
illegals
during
routine
traffic
stops
sparked
by
anything
from
speeding
to
missing

lights

shau
of
the
mercer
barracks
officers
are
required
by
law
to
ascertain
identities
of
not
only
the
driver
but
any
passengers
in
the
vehicle
but
that
is
as
far
as
they
are
allowed
to
go
immigration
enforcement
is
not
under
state
police
jurisdiction
all
we
can
do
is
notify
them
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
shau
said
if
the
driver
or
passenger
is
not
or
cannot
prove
legal
us
residency
and
the
information
he
or
she
provides
doesnt
match
national
identity
databases
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agents
are
notified
people
who
cant
prove
they
are
entitled
to
be
in
the
united
states
are
scheduled
for
hearings
at
immigration
court
and
a
judge
decides
if
they
can
stay
or
should
be
scheduled
for
deportation
some
individuals
are
placed
under
tighter
immigration
surveillance
including
phonein
checks
or
house
arrest
ankle
bracelets
in
noncriminal
incidents
the
alien
often
is
released
a
hearing
notice
is
sent
to
whatever
address
the
individual
provides
agents
have
no
way
of
authenticating
addresses
before
they
send
people
on
their
way
van
pelt
remains
confident
absconders
will
eventually
resurface
this
person
is
breaking
the
law
ultimately
they
are
going
to
run
into
the
law
again
then
bam
they
are
found
