the

pg

length
544
words
as
the
immigrant
population
in
colorado
grows
so
does
interest
in
immigration
law
more
students
at
the
university
of
denver
and
university
of
colorado
law
schools
are
pushing
for
clinics
and
classroom
offerings
on
immigration
law
and
help
in
finding
internships
and
jobs
in
the
field
however
certain
factors
including
the
low
pay
and
lack
of
large
immigration
law
firms
in
colorado
make
it
difficult
for
graduates
to
practice
the
specialty
i
have
seen
the
number
of
immigration
classes
double
in
the
time
i
have
been
here
said
regina
germain
a
professor
at
dus
sturm
college
of
law
since
2006
who
teaches
two
asylumlaw
classes
there
also
has
been
an
increase
in
students
who
want
to
do
internships
in
immigration
law
du
offers
about
five
courses
including
immigration
law
immigration
law
in
spanish
and
asylum
practicum
there
are
two
immigrationlaw
courses
offered
at
cu
in
the
past
they
were
offered
in
alternate
semesters
but
because
of
increased
demand
both
will
be
offered
this
fall
said
associate
law
school
dean
dayna
matthews
when
germain
was
in
law
school
more
than
20
years
ago
there
werent
any
immigration
courses
offered
people
learned
by
doing
it
she
said
immigration
law
is
considered
the
secondmost
complicated
and
convoluted
canon
behind
tax
law
the
original
laws
were
written
in
the
1950s
and
are
constantly
amended
and
updated
by
congress
germain
said
you
really
have
to
stay
on
top
of
it
said
bryony
heise
who
graduated
from
du
a
year
ago
and
opened
a
solo
practice
in
denver
its
exciting
but
also
difficult
intellectually
more
young
immigration
lawyers
are
opening
their
own
practices
because
of
a
tight
job
market
and
because
they
want
to
control
what
types
of
clients
they
take
on
but
many
recent
graduates
who
start
their
own
practices
also
lack
business
experience
this
generation
has
a
focus
on
helping
a
vulnerable
class
and
providing
services
to
immigrants
said
ginger
mcguire
chair
of
the
colorado
chapter
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
but
the
growth
is
so
new
that
we
havent
seen
the
dropoff
because
of
compassion
but
because
of
business
knowhow
ashley
turnerharrington
put
herself
through
law
school
at
cu
to
work
with
immigrant
victims
of
domestic
violence
she
said
she
realized
there
was
a
real
need
for
immigration
attorneys
focusing
on
this
population
during
the
four
years
she
worked
as
a
domesticviolence
advocate
although
there
are
plenty
of
clients
there
are
few
jobs
she
said
she
graduated
in
may
but
hasnt
landed
a
position
its
like
swimming
upstream
not
going
to
any
campus
interviews
only
because
there
werent
any
opportunities
turnerharrington
said
in
2006
cu
tested
an
immigration
law
clinic
but
dropped
it
because
it
needed
to
match
more
closely
with
the
curriculum
and
support
the
schools
holistic
approach
to
law
education
matthews
said
still
when
cu
law
students
were
asked
this
year
what
law
clinics
they
would
like
to
see
most
the
majority
said
immigration
law
cu
is
working
to
set
up
a
program
matthews
said
i
am
amazed
at
how
big
and
compassionate
the
immigrationlaw
community
is
said
matthews
by
big
i
mean
the
number
of
cases
and
how
far
they
reach
into
the
community
