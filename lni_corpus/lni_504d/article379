survey
after
survey
plainly
shows
it
american
voters
are
preoccupied
with
immigration
sometimes
intensely
so
but
in
a
presidential
campaign
in
which
partisan
lines
have
been
sharply
 drawn
over
welfare
and
the
budget
the
subject
of
immigration
has
yet
to
 provoke
muchof
a
stir
with
the
notable
exception
of
pat
buchanan
for
 instance
the
major
republican
challengers
have
been
content
to
voice
 approving
soundbites
about
legal
immigration
while
uniformly
condemning
 illegal
entry
a
year
after
inspiring
the
proposition
187
movement
in
california
to
deny
public
services
to
undocumented
aliens
though
illegal
immigration
is
less
 and
less
the
issue
at
least
in
presidential
politics
everyone
is
against
it
 even
many
of
the
most
ardent
defenders
of
immigration
leaving
little
room
for
argument
it
may
simply
be
too
early
the
campaign
after
all
has
yet
to
move
full
 force
into
the
states
where
immigration
really
matters
like
california
and
 florida
there
may
be
a
deeper
reason
though
when
it
comes
to
immigration
there
 is
no
simple
liberalconservative
divide
its
a
democratic
president
bill
 clinton
who
can
lay
claim
to
actually
cracking
down
on
illegals
and
who
has
 endorsed
a
proposal
to
reduce
the
levels
of
legal
immigration
by
as
much
as
a
 third
only
buchanan
has
gone
further
he
calls
for
a
fiveyear
moratorium
on
most
legal
immigration
while
other
republican
candidates
including
sens
bob
dole
and
phil
gramm
have
pointedly
refused
to
follow
his
lead
to
a
man
they
defend
legal
immigrants
as
an
asset
a
wellspring
of
economic
vigor
for
the
country
meanwhile
it
is
publishing
heir
steve
forbes
who
has
directly
attacked
the
clintonbacked
proposal
to
scale
back
legal
immigration
as
misguided
with
pro
and
antiimmigration
sentiment
crossing
party
lines
some
 political
observers
say
there
is
little
partisan
advantage
in
attacking
legal
 newcomers
for
republican
candidates
and
potentially
much
to
lose
this
issue
is
not
really
a
winner
for
most
republicans said
frank
 sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
 proimmigration
lobbying
group
you
have
many
traditional
conservatives
who
 are
very
pro
immigration
if
youre
a
candidate
who
wants
to
win
the
 republican
nomination
you
have
to
be
very
careful
you
could
lose
cubans
in
 miami
asians
in
california
20
different
ethnic
groups
in
new
york
and
some
 very
conservative
mexicanamericans
in
texas
a
voices
of
florida
poll
last
fall
found
that
an
overwhelming
majority
of
registered
florida
voters
even
hispanic
and
foreignborn
residents
consider
immigration
to
be
a
problem
the
poll
revealed
that
a
majority
of
voters
favor
tough
measures
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
by
denying
access
to
 public
services
such
as
health
care
and
education

and
 wusffm
897
the
news
organizations
joined
forces
to
explore
which
issues
are
 most
important
to
voters
in
florida
in
south
florida
where
cubanamericans
remain
pivotal
to
the
gop
dole
 gramm
and
lamar
alexander
have
found
themselves
treading
very
cautiously
 around
the
immigration
issue
avoiding
talk
about
making
english
the
nations
 official
language
sealing
the
borders
and
declaring
the
american
culture  superior
to
all
others
the
gap
between
buchanan
and
the
others
reflects
deep
divisions
over
immigration
in
the
republican
party
like
dole
gramm
forbes
and
alexander
the
partys
traditional
probusiness
and
libertarian
wings
see
the
growth
that
immigration
produces
as
good
for
the
economy
they
also
regard
some
proposals
to
control
immigration
including
national
 id
cards
and
a
tax
on
businesses
that
import
workers
as
intrusive
big
government
gramm
and
dole
have
taken
firm
stands
on
one
issue
they
have
backed
bills
 that
would
end
or
restrict
immigrants use
of
certain
government
benefits
 including
welfare
and
social
security
but
their
other
forays
into
immigrationrelated
issues
have
been
careful
 even
tentative
in
a
highly
publicized
speech
to
the
american
legion
last
 year
dole
called
for
english
to
be
made
the
countrys
official
language
and
 blasted
bilingual
education
then
seemed
to
quickly
abandon
that
course
alexanders
main
proposal
has
been
to
strip
control
of
the
countrys
 borders
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
turn
it
over
to
 the
military
or
a
private
contractor
the
former
tennessee
governor
said
the
 agency
is
incapable
of
controlling
illegal
border
crossings
at
the
same
time
 that
it
oversees
legal
immigration
those
moderate
stands
could
clash
with
the
hardline
position
of
many
in
the
republican
rankandfile
in
both
houses
of
congress
republicans
have
introduced
bills
that
would
 scale
back
legal
immigration
from
the
present
level
of
about
900000
a
year
 some
drastically
they
would
do
so
by
varying
methods
most
legal
immigrants
are
relatives
of
naturalized
citizens
or
permanent
us
residents
some
proposals
would
bar
parents
siblings
and
adult
children
of
immigrants
from
joining
them
or
place
a
strict
cap
on
their
numbers
for
instance
buchanan
has
backed
a
bill
that
would
freeze
all
immigration
for
five
 years
with
the
exception
of
spouses
and
minor
children
of
us
citizens
the
idea
he
says
is
to
keep
the
millions
of
recent
arrivals
from
 overwhelming
the
country
culturally
and
economically
giving
them
time
to
 learn
english
get
on
their
feet
economically
and
join
the
american
 mainstream
weve
got
to
become
one
country
again buchanan
has
said
at
least
two
bills
are
expected
to
make
it
out
of
committee
this
spring
as
they
come
up
for
debate
and
as
the
presidential
campaigns
move
into
florida
california
and
texas
immigration
could
again
catch
fire
and
the
candidates
could
be
forced
to
show
their
hands
alexander
forbes
and
gramm
have
criticized
the
bills
directly
or
 indirectly
but
none
has
given
specifics
about
how
he
would
deal
with
legal
 immigration
in
columns
in
his
business
magazine
forbes
has
suggested
that
 present
levels
suit
him
fine
gramm
has
left
the
door
open
to
some
restrictions
we
are
here
setting
up
arbitrary
limits
that
prevent
people
who
came
here
legally
who
have
been
successful
who
have
achieved
the
american
dream
from
bringing
their
kinfolk
to
america he
said
recently
i
do
not
think
that
 is
right
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
sense
yet
he
added
on
another
occasion
i
think
we
ought
to
put
a
premium
on
 people
who
can
bring
new
skills
new
energy
but
im
not
ready
to
tear
down
 the
statue
