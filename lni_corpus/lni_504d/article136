immigration
is
poised
to
be
a
heated
issue
this
year
with
oklahoma
lawmakers
proposing
nearly
30
bills
ranging
from
restricting
property
rights
of
noncitizens
to
requiring
school
officials
know
the
legal
status
of
students
an
analysis
by
the
oklahoman
of
bills
filed
shows
a
number
of
education
and
law
enforcement
issues
relating
to
undocumented
immigrants
lawmakers
also
have
formed
a
joint
committee
to
tackle
the
subject
the
committee
will
look
at
all
of
oklahomas
policies
and
consider
ideas
that
will
benefit
our
state

legislature
postponed
meetings
but
goals
and
timelines
are
still
in
the
works
brejka
said
so
far
there
are
a
lot
of
ideas
to
consider
some
proposed
bills
are
not
complete
and
contain
little
more
than
a
title
or
section
of
the
law
being
addressed
more
information
and
details
could
be
added
to
these
bills
during
the
legislative
session
which
ends
in
may
titles
include
the
immigration
policy
improvement
act
and
the
oklahoma
illegal
immigration
act
other
proposed
legislation
is
more
developed
the
interstate
compact
for
birth
certificates
act
takes
up
the
issue
of
birthright
citizenship
and
anchor
babies
establishing
citizenship
requirements
and
laying
out
protocols
for
issuing
birth
certificates
to
babies
born
in
the
united
states
several
bills
would
have
schools
identify
undocumented
students
one
would
allow
school
districts
to
charge
students
not
lawfully
present
in
the
country
others
would
prohibit
them
from
resident
tuition
with
words
echoing
the
arizona
immigration
law
enacted
last
year
one
piece
of
legislation
would
allow
law
enforcement
with
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
person
is
an
alien
to
determine
the
persons
immigration
status
yet
another
would
allow
relatives
of
deported
immigrants
to
be
investigated
and
if
appropriate
removed
from
the
country
of
more
than
a
handful
of
filed
bills
relating
to
law
enforcement
one
would
allow
the
state
department
of
corrections
to
issue
arrest
warrants
for
anyone
who
illegally
returns
to
the
country
and
isnt
currently
in
prison
one
bill
addresses
unauthorized
immigrants
and
population
counts
for
congressional
redistricting
another
would
disallow
the
rent
or
purchase
of
property
by
illegal
immigrants

20
bills

ron
justice
rchickasha
said
compromises
wont
be
easy
in
the
often
emotional
immigrationreform
debate
justice
seven
legislators
and
the
attorney
general
are
a
part
of
the
committee
he
said
there
are
federal
issues
state
lawmakers
cant
fix
jumping
to
conclusions
and
making
hasty
decisions
will
only
inflame
the
rancor
i
think
anytime
we
pass
legislation
we
have
to
be
mindful
of
other
things
that
can
be
affected
he
said
sometimes
there
are
unintended
consequences
and
we
have
to
keep
that
in
mind
douglas
stump
an
oklahoma
city
immigration
attorney
and
executive
committee
member
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
cautioned
lawmakers
to
be
careful
when
considering
legislation
the
concept
that
states
want
to
get
involved
in
immigration
is
understandable
in
light
of
the
federal
governments
gridlock
on
the
subject
stump
said
however
having
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
is
leading
to
chaos
overall
and
to
isolation
of
the
states
that
take
the
harsher
views
laws
that
have
landed
states
in
court
such
as
arizona
and
oklahomas
immigration
laws
cost
taxpayers
draw
law
enforcement
and
the
courts
away
from
serious
crimes
and
can
harm
police
officers
relationships
in
immigrant
communities
he
said
oklahoma
has
fewer
undocumented
immigrants
than
most
states
but
politicians
here
have
built
careers
around
the
issue
they
do
nothing
to
really
address
the
problem
stump
said
many
are
beginning
to
question
whether
some
of
these
legislative
efforts
are
a
gimmick
to
garner
votes
and
revenue
for
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
in
the
absence
of
federal
reform
more
people
are
speaking
out
and
local
interests
are
being
forced
to
step
up
try
things
out
and
see
what
sticks
said
sgt
shannon
clark
coordinator
of
the
tulsa
county
287
g
federal
immigration
program
the
program
is
a
joint
effort
with
federal
immigration
officials
to
identify
detain
and
remove
illegal
immigrants
you
can
honestly
say
every
county
and
municipality
in
the
state
has
had
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
in
some
capacity
clark
said
but
if
the
legislature
is
going
to
make
policies
they
have
to
make
an
effort
to
educate
police
officers
clark
has
played
an
active
role
in
the
law
enforcement
community
educating
officers
about
the
roles
they
play
in
immigration
enforcement
and
resources
that
are
available
he
helped
train
officers
following
the
passage
of
house
bill
1804
oklahomas
antiimmigration
law
we
can
make
all
the
rules
and
laws
we
want
but
if
law
enforcement
doesnt
know
how
to
enforce
them
its
almost
not
worth
the
debate
clark
said
states
attention
is
on
immigration
the
number
of
state
laws
relating
to
immigration
peaked
in
2007
declined
in
2008
and
rose
again
in
2009
data
from
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
show
in
2010
more
than
1400
bills
were
proposed
and
208
laws
were
enacted
by
46
state
legislatures
and
the
district
of
columbia
ann
morse
program
director
for
the
immigration
policy
project
at
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
said
many
states
this
year
are
moving
ahead
with
arizonastyle
laws
and
law
enforcement
and
worksiteenforcement
bills
immigration
remains
a
live
issue
in
places
where
laws
have
passed
already
