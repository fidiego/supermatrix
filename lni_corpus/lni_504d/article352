the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
does
not
suggest
that
mass
immigration
is
the
only
cause
of
urban
and
suburban
sprawl
in
the
united
states
but
nobody
can
dispute
that
immigration
is
an
important
factor
our
population
is
projected
to
grow
by
130
million
people
over
the
next
50
years
the
majority
of
which
according
to
the
census
bureau
will
be
directly
attributable
to
our
immigration
policies
there
is
also
an
identifiable
phenomenon
of
secondary
migration
in
areas
where
immigration
has
exceeded
the
capacity
of
social
institutions
to
cope
with
it
effectively
americans
have
sought
relief
by
moving
to
outlying
areas
how
can
we
discuss
one
of
our
most
important
public
policies
if
every
criticism
of
immigration
policy
is
equated
with
blaming
immigrants
