i
am
a
strong
proponent
of
securing
our
borders
and
enforcing
our
interior
immigration
laws
in
addition
i
believe
it
is
irresponsible
for
congress
to
even
consider
a
guest
worker
program
until
our
borders
are
secure
and
our
current
immigration
laws
are
enforced
unfortunately
the
united
states
senate
is
currently
debating
just
that
legislation
which
will
grant
amnesty
to
many
of
the
12
to
20
million
illegal
aliens
who
are
currently
residing
in
the
us
and
will
create
a
far
reaching
guest
worker
program
proponents
of
this
legislation
led
by
sen
ted
kennedy
dmass
like
to
call
it
comprehensive
immigration
reform
but
i
will
call
it
what
it
is
amnestyspan
the
actions
of
the
senate
show
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
the
will
to
enforce
our
current
immigration
laws
cities
and
states
across
the
nation
under
pressure
from
crimes
being
committed
by
illegal
aliens
in
their
communities
are
being
forced
to
do
the
federal
governments
job
by
implementing
policies
that
give
local
law
enforcement
the
tools
they
need
to
enforce
immigration
laws
last
month
the
tulsa
city
council
voted
63
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
all
individuals
who
are
arrested
on
felony
or
misdemeanor
charges
and
reporting
those
with
illegal
status
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
i
applaud
the
city
council
for
taking
this
step
in
the
right
direction
to
end
tulsas
long
standing
hands
off
immigration
policy
by
allowing
tulsa
police
officers
to
report
immigration
violations
to
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
office
for
both
felony
and
misdemeanor
offenses
we
can
help
bolster
tulsas
case
for
a
permanent
ice
presence
i
encourage
mayor
taylor
to
accept
this
policy
change
as
i
continue
to
fight
for
more
federal
immigration
resources
it
is
imperative
that
local
and
state
law
enforcement
become
willing
partners
with
the
federal
government
to
protect
our
nations
interior
from
criminal
illegal
aliens
i
am
disappointed
that
the
senate
has
chosen
to
go
down
the
amnesty
road
as
the
policy
of
granting
amnesty
is
a
proven
failure
in
our
country
the
immigration
reform
control
act
of
1986
which
granted
amnesty
to
three
million
illegal
aliens
did
nothing
to
stem
the
tide
of
illegal
aliens
crossing
our
borders
but
rather
contributed
to
the
explosion
of
illegal
immigration
our
nation
faces
today
granting
amnesty
to
illegal
aliens
would
be
an
utter
failure
just
like
it
was
in
1986
we
are
rewarding
law
breakers
with
a
path
to
us
citizenship
our
nations
highest
honor
this
is
not
in
the
economic
or
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states
according
to
the
heritage
foundation
amnesty
legislation
would
result
in
the
largest
expansion
of
the
welfare
state
in
35
years
costing
taxpayers
untold
billions
in
social
services
and
federal
entitlement
programs
why
would
congress
ever
consider
implementing
such
a
failure
again
the
house
of
representatives
took
positive
steps
last
year
to
strengthen
our
borders
and
enforce
our
interior
immigration
laws
i
was
supportive
of
hr
4437
the
border
protection
antiterrorism
and
illegal
immigration
control
act
of
2005
in
the
109th
congress
this
legislation
established
more
physical
barriers
along
the
borders
hired
more
border
patrol
agents
created
the
tools
necessary
for
employers
to
ensure
they
are
hiring
a
legal
workforce
and
gave
the
local
and
state
law
enforcement
the
tools
necessary
to
enforce
immigration
laws
this
is
the
type
of
immigration
legislation
that
congress
needs
to
concentrate
on
to
secure
our
borders
and
end
illegal
immigration
to
be
clear
i
am
not
opposed
to
legal
immigration
i
welcome
those
who
wish
to
come
to
our
country
to
pursue
the
american
dream
through
legal
measures
america
is
a
nation
built
by
immigrants
who
are
vital
to
our
culture
and
society
however
america
is
a
nation
of
laws
and
those
who
have
broken
the
law
and
are
here
illegally
should
not
be
rewarded
with
a
continued
stay
in
the
us
and
a
path
toward
citizenship
it
is
imperative
that
we
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
immigration
system
and
the
sovereignty
of
our
great
nation
by
enforcing
and
strengthening
existing
immigration
laws
and
rejecting
amnesty
legislation
