immigration
is
usually
portrayed
as
a
leftright
issue
with
the
left
in
favor
and
the
right
against
in
fact
the
political
right
is
deeply
split
on
this
sensitive
subject
thats
why
rightwinger
peter
brimelow
finds
himself
attacking
his
ideological
soulmates
as
he
dissects
american
immigration
policy
in
his
book
alien
nation
open
unselective
immigration
the
prevailing
policy
in
both
canada
and
the
us
is
a
logical
outgrowth
of
neoconservative
ideology
neoconservatives
believe
that
market
forces
not
governments
should
determine
how
many
immigrants
come
to
a
country
the
true
believer
wants
to
remove
as
much
power
as
possible
from
government
including
the
power
to
control
the
nations
borders
he
rejects
the
counterargument
that
uncontrolled
immigration
is
damaging
to
the
national
or
collective
interest
for
him
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
collective
interest
only
individual
interests
the
second
reason
the
right
typically
favors
wideopen
immigration
is
practical
rather
than
ideological
increasing
the
supply
of
labor
decreases
its
price
brian
mulroneys
progressive
conservative
government
representing
bay
street
dumped
the
traditional
canadian
immigration
program
which
was
one
of
moderate
fluctuating
levels
with
an
emphasis
on
skills
in
favor
of
a
new
program
of
permanent
high
immigration
levels
the
populist
right
on
the
other
hand
includes
in
its
constituency
people
who
actually
work
for
hourly
wages
and
therefore
disapprove
of
polices
aimed
at
depressing
them
this
explains
why
the
reform
party
representing
main
street
supports
a
return
to
normal
immigration
levels
brimelow
who
used
to
live
in
canada
where
he
wrote
for
macleans
and
the
financial
post
and
now
writes
for
the
business
elites
who
read
the
wall
street
journal
and
forbes
comes
down
on
the
side
of
the
populists
by
urging
a
sharp
cut
in
us
immigration
he
takes
issue
with
the
journals
ultraconservative
editor
robert
bartley
who
wants
totally
open
borders
brimelow
minces
no
words
about
who
benefits
from
the
sort
of
policies
the
journal
advocates
drawing
on
the
work
of
the
economist
george
borjas
he
demonstrates
that
current
us
immigration
policy
has
only
one
significant
economic
impact
to
drive
down
the
wages
of
us
workers
by
120
billion
a
year
where
does
this
vast
sum
go
into
the
pockets
of
the
capitalists
of
course
the
american
elites
support
for
immigration
may
not
be
idealistic
at
all
concludes
brimelow
but
selfinterested
as
a
way
to
prey
on
their
fellow
americans
alien
nation
is
full
of
informative
data
like
this
much
of
it
as
relevant
to
canadians
as
to
americans
because
on
a
per
capita
basis
we
have
twice
as
much
immigration
as
the
americans
do
and
our
immigration
program
like
theirs
is
now
based
chiefly
on
family
relationships
rather
than
skills
unfortunately
the
book
is
marred
by
brimelows
peculiar
ideas
on
the
subject
of
race
until
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
amendments
of
1965
the
us
favored
whites
over
nonwhites
in
its
immigration
policy
canada
got
rid
of
a
similar
policy
about
the
same
time
but
by
choosing
to
accept
immigrants
mainly
on
the
basis
of
family
relationships
both
countries
now
in
effect
restrict
immigration
to
residents
of
a
handful
of
nonwhite
countries
because
they
are
the
only
ones
who
have
recentlyarrived
relatives
who
wish
to
sponsor
them
this
is
unfair
to
prospective
immigrants
who
dont
have
sponsors
and
gives
the
receiving
country
no
control
over
who
gets
in
but
brimelow
thinks
the
sponsorship
system
is
bad
mainly
because
it
is
tilting
the
racial
balance
of
the
us
which
was
90
per
cent
white
30
years
ago
and
should
in
his
opinion
have
stayed
that
way
a
british
immigrant
himself
he
seems
to
think
the
us
is
essentially
a
white
british
nation
this
is
a
profound
misunderstanding
of
a
country
that
has
always
been
multicultural
and
whose
major
contribution
to
world
civilization
is
jazz
music
a
black
invention
brimelow
nowhere
suggests
that
nonwhites
are
inferior
but
he
believes
that
different
races
cant
get
along
and
that
countries
with
racially
diverse
populations
will
inevitably
succumb
to
multiethnic
mayhem
his
argument
is
unconvincing
canada
britain
and
australia
are
examples
of
countries
where
people
of
different
races
coexist
peacefully
moreover
racial
and
cultural
uniformity
is
no
guarantee
of
social
harmony
somalia
for
example
is
one
of
the
most
homogeneous
nations
in
the
world
and
yet
it
destroyed
itself
in
a
civil
war
by
his
misguided
emphasis
on
race
brimelow
gives
those
he
calls
immigration
enthusiasts
a
chance
to
dismiss
the
rest
of
the
book
when
they
might
learn
something
by
reading
it
high
immigration
levels
are
neither
necessary
nor
beneficial
to
the
economy
mass
immigration
hurts
those
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
ladder
the
skill
levels
of
immigrants
are
in
freefall
massive
nonwhite
immigration
coupled
with
affirmative
action
quotas
make
an
explosive
combination
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
points
brimelow
makes
and
they
are
just
as
applicable
to
canada
as
to
the
us
his
best
argument
is
the
what
if
question
what
if
those
who
favor
the
current
policy
are
wrong
the
result
will
be
severe
and
longstanding
economic
social
and
environmental
problems
but
what
if
those
who
favor
less
immigration
are
wrong
the
result
would
be
a
temporary
labor
shortage
that
could
easily
be
fixed
by
opening
the
immigration
tap
a
bit
wider
in
other
words
the
consequences
of
too
little
immigration
are
minimal
while
those
of
too
much
are
grave
there
is
no
good
reason
to
risk
those
consequences
as
brimelow
points
out
high
immigration
levels
are
not
an
unstoppable
natural
phenomenon
but
rather
the
result
of
deliberate
government
policy
and
since
that
policy
is
both
unnecessary
and
deeply
unpopular
brimelow
is
probably
right
in
predicting
that
it
will
soon
be
changed
