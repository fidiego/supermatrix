a

immigration

for
five
years
by
about
10
percent
below

levels
a
failure
to
cut
legal
immigration
will
contribute
even
more
to
the
general
cynicism
about
congress
said
simpson
chief
author
of
the
overall
senate
immigration
bill
he
claimed
that
polls
show
up
to
threefourths
of
the
americans
support
cuts
in
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
he
said
many
senators
who
opposed
the
amendment
said

on
legal
immigration
should
not
be
inserted
into
the
pending
immigration
bill
designed
to
get
tough
on
illegal
aliens
the
legislation
before
the
senate
right
now
aims
to
crack
down
on

violate
the
laws
people
who
seek
to
come
to
this
country
without
having
proper
documentation
to
take
advantage
of
the
benefits
of
america
said
sen
spencer
abraham
rmich
legal
immigrants
on
the
other
hand
want
to
come
to
this
country
in
a
positive
and
constructive
way
to
make
a
contribution
to
play
by
the
rules
and
to
make
a
great
great
addition
to
our
american
family
he
said
rules
dealing
with
such
immigration
should
be
given
full
attention
in
a
separate
bill
which
is
pending
