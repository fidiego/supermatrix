monday
after
arizona
why
are
10
states
considering
immigration
bills
the
arizona
immigration
law
set
off
a
national
powder
keg
but
state
lawmakers
are
not
shying
away
from
the
issue
and
some
appear
to
be
inspired
by
arizona
byline
daniel

wood
staff
writer

713
words
given
the
anger
sparked
by
arizonas
immigration
bill
nationwide
including
protests
and
calls
to
boycott
arizona
the
campaign
promises
of
colorado
gubernatorial
candidate
scott
mcinnis
could
be
seen
as
a
bit
of
a
surprise
he
has
vowed
to
follow
arizonas
lead
and
pass
a
tough
new
antiillegal
immigration
law
we
are
stopping
the
retreat
no
more
retreat
he
said
in
a
local
radio
interview
federal
government
if
you
are
not
going
to
do
it
we
are
going
to
do
it
mr
mcinniss
comments
are
but
one
example
of
how
the
arizona
firestorm
has
hardly
scared
off
politicians
in
other
states
around
the
country
in
some
cases
it
might
actually
be
encouraging
them
oklahoma
is
looking
at
passing
tougher
penalties
for
illegal
immigrants
caught
with
firearms
south
carolina
might
make
it
illegal
to
hire
workers
on
the
side
of
the
road
in
addition
state
immigration
legislation
is
also
being
considered
in
idaho
utah
missouri
texas
north
carolina
maryland
minnesota
and
colorado
in
many
cases
the
potential
legislation
is
merely
part
of
the
perpetual
national
debate
about
immigration
which
has
taken
form
in
more
than
200
statelevel
immigration
bills
being
signed
into
law
each
year
from
2007
to
2009
notes
catherine
wilson
a
political
scientist
at
villanova
university
in
philadelphia
but
there
could
be
at
least
a
shade
of
political
opportunism
as
well
says
steven
schier
a
political
scientist
at
carleton
college
in
northfield
minn
this
all
means
that
republicans
elsewhere
see
political
advantage
in
pressing
for
arizonastyle
laws
he
says
arizona
law
a
tipping
point
for
statesthat
would
not
be
unprecedented
in
2004
arizona
approved
prop
200
which
barred
illegal
immigrants
from
receiving
most
nonessential
state
benefits
and
services
many
other
states
followed
antiillegal
immigration
advocates
argue
that
the
new
arizona
immigration
law
represented
a
tipping
point
that
other
states
are
now
following
what
we
are
witnessing
around
the
country
is
that
the
publics
patience
is
wearing
out
with
the
federal
governments
failure
to
enforce
immigration
laws
and
protect
the
interests
of
american
workers
and
taxpayers
says
ira
mehlman
spokesman
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
local
officials
who
tend
to
be
more
intune
with
the
concerns
of
their
constituents
are
responding
and
doing
what
they
can
to
address
a
serious
problem
for
their
states
and
communities
he
says
but
the
movement
among
statehouses
to
enact
immigrationrelated
legislation
began
to
take
shape
well
before
the
arizona
law
says
professor
wilson
she
pinpoints
2006
and
notes
that
the
200
immigrationrelated
bills
passed
between
2007
and
2009
included
40
states
and
ranged
in
topic
from
law
enforcement
and
employer
verification
to
identification
and
licenses
new
levels
of
frustrationthe
publics
renewed
focus
on
immigration
issues
together
with
recent
events
like
the
highprofile
killing
of
an
arizona
rancher
are
expected
to
increase
the
tide
of
legislation
three
national
polls
have
shown
wide
support
for
arizonas
sb
1070
in
particular
and
crackdowns
on
undocumented
immigrants
in
general
we
should
expect
this
trend
of
statelevel
activity
to
accelerate
this
year
in
the
absence
of
federal
legislation
on
immigration
wilson
says
president
obamas
tacit
acknowledgment
that
immigration
reform
is
not
feasible
in
the
short
term
and
his
recent
quips
at
a
white
house
correspondents
dinner
where
he
mocked
the
arizona
law
have
fueled
frustration
says
jack
pitney
a
political
scientist
at
claremont
mckenna
college
immigration
activists
have
posted
a
video
to
youtube
that
juxtaposes
his
comical
remarks
with
statistics
on
soaring
drug
smuggling
and
narcotics
prosecutions
the
video
includes
the
punch
line
president
obama
broken
borders
are
not
a
laughing
matter
do
your
job
and
secure
the

president
obamas
mockery
of
the
arizona
law
has
handed
ammunition
to
its
proponents
