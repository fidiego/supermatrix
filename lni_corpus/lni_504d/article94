crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
sb1070
the
obama
administration
sued
to
overturn
parts
of
the
law
contending
that
only
federal
law
comprehensively
deals
with
immigration
the
court
upheld
section
2b
which
mandates
that
state
and
local
police
inquire
about
whether
someone
lawfully
detained
is
in
the
country
legally
if
reasonable
suspicion
warrants
the
question
this
is
what
some
critics
have
called
the
show
us
your
papers
section
of
the
law
but
three
major
elements
of
sb1070
were
thrown
out
because
as
the
courts
majority
decision
written
by
california
native
anthony
kennedy
maintained
arizona
may
have
understandable
frustrations
with
the
problems
caused
by
illegal
immigration
but
the
state
may
not
pursue
policies
that
undermine
federal
law
the
court
overturned
these
elements
section
3
said
that
its
also
a
violation
of
arizona
law
to
violate
federal
immigration
law
section
5c
said
it
is
unlawful
for
an
illegal
immigrant
to
knowingly
apply
for
work
solicit
work
in
a
public
place
or
perform
work
as
an
employee
or
independent
contractor
and
section
6
allowed
that
a
state
or
local
officer
without
a
warrant
may
arrest
a
person
if
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
the
person
has
committed
any
public
offense
that
makes
the
person
removable
from
the
united
states
in
a
statement
president
barack
obama
said
i
am
pleased
that
the
supreme
court
has
struck
down
key
provisions
of
arizonas
immigration
law
what
this
decision
makes
unmistakably
clear
is
that
congress
must
act
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
is
not
a
solution
to
our
broken
immigration
system
its
part
of
the
problem
the
president
is
right
on
that
but
now
hes
in
campaign
mode
for
the
november
election
the
time
for
enacting
immigration
reform
was
during
mr
obamas
first
two
years
in
office
when
both
houses
of
congress
were
held
by
democrats
and
the
senate
had
a
filibusterproof
6040
majority
mitt
romney
the
presumptive
republican
nominee
for
president
criticized
the
president
monday
for
failing
to
reform
immigration
law
but
gov
romneys
own
positions
on
immigration
seem
to
fluctuate
daily
what
we
need
is
to
take
the
leadership
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
the
committee
chairmen
and
lock
them
in
a
room
to
work
out
immigration
reform
ilya
shapiro
told
us
hes
a
senior
fellow
in
constitutional
studies
at
the
libertarian
cato
institute
he
said
reform
should
include
some
form
of
a
guestworker
program
and
a
path
to
us
citizenship
for
those
who
have
been
here
illegally
for
many
years
but
havent
violated
other
laws
enacting
such
processes
also
would
improve
law
enforcement
and
national
security
mr
shapiro
said
divisions
within
the
political
parties
have
stalled
reform
most
republicans
are
ok
with
bringing
in
foreign
engineers
and
scientists
who
quickly
become
employed
and
pay
taxes
but
democrats
also
insist
on
regularizing
unskilled
immigrants
within
democratic
party
constituencies
theres
a
division
between
organized
labor
which
fears
new
immigrants
will
put
downward
pressure
on
union
wages
and
immigrantrights
groups
and
within
the
republican
party
theres
also
a
division
between
generally
proimmigrant
business
groups
and
the
more
restrictionist
rankandfile
california
has
nothing
like
arizonas
sb1070
so
the
court
ruling
does
not
have
direct
impact
here
however
mr
shapiro
said
the
ruling
provides
general
guidelines
for
immigration
laws
in
all
states
states
can
tinker
around
the
edges
of
immigration
law
but
if
the
feds
are
involved
then
their
actions
take
precedence
he
said
with
the
preeminent
role
of
the
federal
government
in
immigration
affirmed
by
the
high
court
national
reform
by
congress
can
move
to
center
stage
but
no
doubt
not
until
after
voters
have
their
say
