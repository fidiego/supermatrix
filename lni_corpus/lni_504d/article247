the
illegal
immigrant
status
and
prior
criminal
record
of
at
least
one
suspect
in
the
killings
of
three
youths
in
newark
last
week
has
intensified
debate
over
when
authorities
should
contact
immigration
agents
about
someone
in
their
custody
newark
city
councilman
ron
c
rice
on
monday
called
for
a
city
resolution
requiring
newark
police
to
contact
immigration
agents
when
a
felony
suspect
is
deemed
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
those
who
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
say
the
ability
of
murder
suspect
jose
carranza
an
undocumented
immigrant
from
peru
to
roam
the
streets
before
the
killings
despite
pending
assault
and
child
rape
charges
underscores
the
need
for
steppedup
contact
between
local
authorities
and
federal
immigration
agents
many
say
police
should
routinely
check
immigration
status
during
the
normal
course
of
their
work
but
advocates
for
immigrants
argue
that
the
newark
killings
are
not
an
immigration
issue
and
expressed
concern
that
all
illegal
immigrants
would
be
stigmatized
as
potential
killers
this
was
a
heinous
crime
and
these
suspects
have
deep
psychological
issues
said
gustavo
ramirez
head
of
the
passaicbased
immigration
and
american
citizenship
organization
or
iaco
this
crime
however
cannot
be
explained
by
immigration
status
any
more
than
terrorism
can
be
morristown
mayor
donald
cresitello
who
wants
his
towns
police
to
be
deputized
as
immigration
agents
said
that
if
the
socalled
287g
the
federal
program
that
deputizes
local
and
state
police
authorities
to
enforce
immigration
matters
had
been
in
place
in
newark
and
essex
county
carranza
most
likely
would
have
remained
in
custody
after
previous
arrests
carranza
28
had
been
freed
on
bail
this
year
on
charges
of
aggravated
assault
related
to
a
barroom
fight
and
31
counts
of
aggravated
sexual
assault
of
a
child
and
endangering
the
welfare
of
a

week

four
other

three
college

shootings
carranza
has
pleaded
not
guilty
to
charges
of
firstdegree
murder
attempted
murder
and
robbery
authorities
with
the
essex
county
prosecutors
office
say
they
typically
do
not
contact
immigration
authorities
about
an
illegal
immigrant
until
after
the
defendant
is
convicted
one
published
report
attributed
the
reason
for
the
policy
to
a
concern
by
essex
county
authorities
that
defendants
would
be
deported
before
they
could
be
punished
smith
said
she
could
not
immediately
confirm
that
concern
as
the
reason
for
the
policy
immigration
authorities
say
that
essex
county
authorities
did
not
alert
them
about
carranza
until
last
week
we
have
no
record
relating
to
any
of
his
previous
arrests
said
marc
raimondi
a
spokesman
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
in
the
event
that
we
are
contacted
regarding
an
illegal
alien
who
is
accused
of
a
violent
crime
or
rape
of
a
child
we
will
put
them
at
the
top
of
our
priority
list
bill
maer
spokesman
for
the
passaic
county
sheriffs
department
said
the
sheriffs
department
performs
checks
on
individuals
that
enter
into
their
custody
if
there
is
an
immigration
issue
he
said
ice
is
alerted
but
it
is
up
to
federal
authorities
to
decide
if
theyre
going
to
take
action
maer
said
its
not
our
place
to
enforce
immigration
law
its
ices
job
we
just
fulfill
our
obligation
to
notify
them
when
an
issue
arises
he
said
raimondi
said
that
immigration
authorities
generally
wait
until
after
a
defendant
has
served
his
or
her
sentence
before
moving
to
deport
them
but
he
said
that
immigration
does
have
the
power
to
keep
an
illegal
immigrant
from
being
freed
on
bail
pending
the
resolution
of
a
case
whats
more
he
said
immigration
authorities
still
can
deport
a
defendant
who
has
been
acquitted
