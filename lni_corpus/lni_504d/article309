this
week
in

to

and
customs
agents
in
tucson
ariz
president
bush
fastened
the
nations
attention
on
our
immigration
imbroglio
that
should
come
as
no
surprise
many
americans
are
very
concerned
about
immigration
policy
nation
of
immigrants
that
we
are
our
appraisal
of
the
problem
has
changed
once
again
during
periods
of
the
19th
century
the
nation
was
ambivalent
about
immigration
a
whole
political
party
the
knownothings
was
against
it
in
the
1850s
toward
the
end
of
the
century
when
large
groups
of
irish
and
italians
were
swarming
in
the
nations
older
immigrants
were
against
it
yet
as
the
20th
century
took
on
years
and
the
economy
became
more
industrialized
and
prosperous
americans
viewed
immigration
more
benignly
a
majority
came
to
a
positive
acceptance
of
it
that
is
not
true
today
certainly
it
is
not
true
with
regard
to
illegal
immigration
for
the
first
time
since
the
gallup
poll
began
a
majority
of
americans
think
immigration
is
bad
rather
than
good
thus
politicians
of
all
persuasions
are
promising
action
the
bush
policy
is
to
address
border
security
and
illegal
immigration
the
president
has
reversed
his
emphasis
last
time
around
he
suggested
addressing
illegal
immigration
first
with
a
guest
worker
program
and
tough
enforcement
of
border
control
second
those
in
favor
of
tough
enforcement
of
border
control
and
of
action
against
illegal
immigration
think
the
president
is
not
being
tough
enough
and
these
restrictions
are
drawn
from
both
ends
of
the
political
spectrum
both
sides
in
this
debate
fail
to
note
the
obvious
there
is
a
market
for
immigrants
in
this
country
the
president
is
more
cognizant
of
this
than
those
who
would
restrict
immigration
but
turn
to
consider
the
market
for
a
minute
1
producers
need
immigrants
2
immigrants
are
coming
here
because
there
is
work
that
enriches
them
this
market
has
been
helpful
to
the
economy
it
is
growing
robustly
and
without
one
of
the
feared
downsides
of
immigration
or
even
illegal
immigration
unemployment
we
are
almost
at
full
employment
and
with
two
to
three
times
as
many
illegal
immigrants
in
the
country
as
in
the
mid1980s
when
senator
alan
simpson
last
addressed
the
immigration
issue
that
is
pretty
much
proof
that
the
economy
can
accept
immigration
and
prosper
the
real
problem
is
border
security
and
an
orderly
society
we
need
to
know
who
is
entering
the
country
and
that
they
abide
by
the
laws
so
congress
is
preparing
a
series
of
get
tough
measures
the
toughest
of
which
is
probably
that
envisaged
by
tom
tancredo
of
colorado
and
j
d
hayworth
of
arizona
their
legislation
would
deputize
state
and
local
police
to
arrest
the
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
possibly
12
million
and
deport
them
some
argue
we
should
somehow
drop
the
arrested
immigrants
into
the
interior
of
their
countries
how
would
this
be
done
by
a
gigantic
parachute
drop
any
prudent
law
has
to
be
based
on
what
james
madison
in
the
federalist
papers
called
the
genius
of
the
people
the
american
people
are
by
nature
generous
optimistic
and
tolerant
it
is
apparent
at
least
to
me
that
as
we
began
arresting
illegal
immigrants
the
process
would
soon
come
to
a
sorry
end
wretched
immigrants
would
be
held
up
by
many
americans
now
favoring
the
tough
approach
as
the
victims
of
unjust
law
enforcers
civil
libertarians
would
step
in
the
approach
would
be
brought
to
ruin
and
the
hateamerica
crowd
would
have
more
spurious
evidence
that
this
is
a
racist
and
intolerant
country
there
is
a
better
approach
we
have
the
capacity
to
close
off
the
border
and
we
should
we
also
have
the
capacity
to
encourage
many
of
the
illegal
immigrants
to
enroll
in
a
program
aimed
at
amnesty
but
one
that
does
not
make
chumps
of
legal
immigrants
who
have
played
by
the
rules
the
legislation
of
the
1980s
ended
in
amnesty
and
well
over
half
the
illegals
became
lawabiding
citizens
the
burden
on
the
president
and
congress
is
to
close
off
the
border
and
get
the
present
immigrants
to
enter
amnesty
programs
this
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
accomplish
but
it
is
certainly
more
practical
and
feasible
than
the
tough
approaches
now
being
bandied
about
the
market
for
immigrants
is
here
and
will
not
evaporate
the
knownothings
faded
away
but
the
bad
repute
they
settled
on
the
country
endured
unfairly
but
it
endured
