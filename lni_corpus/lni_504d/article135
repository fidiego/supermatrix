there
has
been
a
major
shift
toward
proenforcement
policies
in
the
united
states
diminishing
the
prospect
of
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants
critics
of
proenforcement
policies
allege
that
is
antiimmigrant
but
that
couldnt
be
further
from
the
truth
favoring
the
rule
of
law
isnt
meanspirited
or
racist
it
is
the
very
foundation
of
the
united
states
and
is
at
the
core
of
why
america
can
welcome
immigrants
we
have
by
far
the
most
generous
legal
immigration
system
in
the
world
admitting
1
million
immigrants
each
year
that
has
always
been
a
net
benefit
for
the
united
states
however
illegal
immigration
puts
a
strain
on
our
economy
schools
and
hospitals
and
even
poses
serious
national
security
threats
enforcing
all
of
our
laws
including
immigration
laws
is
critical
to
our
success
and
sovereignty
as
a
nation
immigration
laws
do
not
discriminate
against
individuals
based
on
their
color
creed
gender
or
ethnic
background
instead
the
law
makes
a
distinction
between
lawkeepers
and
lawbreakers
a
crime
is
a
crime
no
matter
who
commits
it
many
proenforcement
policies
actually
would
reduce
discrimination
take
everify
for
example
this
remarkably
successful
program
enables
companies
to
hire
legal
workers
by
verifying
the
social
security
numbers
provided
by
new
employees
everify
does
not
ask
ethnicity
or
race
it
simply
makes
sure
the
persons
name
date
of
birth
and
social
security
number
or
alien
identification
number
match
if
they
do
the
process
is
over
if
they
dont
and
the
person
has
a
legal
right
to
work
in
the
united
states
the
employee
then
has
an
opportunity
to
resolve
the
discrepancy
which
most
do
successfully
within
a
few
days
everify
opens
up
job
opportunities
for
citizens
and
legal
immigrants
by
turning
off
the
jobs
magnet
that
encourages
illegal
immigration
if
illegal
immigrants
can
no
longer
live
and
work
in
the
united
states
many
will
simply
return
home
voluntarily
and
taxpayer
dollars
will
be
saved
according
to
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
illegal
immigration
costs
american
taxpayers
113
billion
annually
this
amounts
to
1117
per
household
to
pay
for
the
health
care
education
welfare
and
incarceration
of
illegal
immigrants
illegal
immigration
drains
states
budgets
too
california
is
expected
to
have
a
25
billion
budget
shortfall
by
june
2012
at
the
same
time
illegal
immigration
costs
the
golden
state
nearly
22
billion
each
year
if
immigration
laws
were
fully
enforced
californias
budget
deficit
would
nearly
be
eliminated
proenforcement
supporters
believe
it
is
wrong
for
americans
to
bear
these
exorbitant
costs
by
reducing
the
flow
of
illegal
immigrants
into
the
united
states
we
can
reduce
the
financial
burden
on
american
taxpayers
critics
say
proenforcement
policies
harm
the
republican
partys
future
with
hispanic
voters
but
the
facts
prove
otherwise
the
november
midterm
election
results
repudiated
the
openborders
philosophy
and
revealed
a
promising
future
for
the
republican
party
exit
polls
showed
38
percent
of
hispanic
voters
cast
ballots
for
house
republican
candidates
this
historically
high
level
of
hispanic
support
for
republican
candidates
came
despite
widespread
preelection
claims
by
advocates
for
illegal
immigration
that
a
new
arizona
immigration
law
and
a
proruleoflaw
stand
would
undercut
hispanic
support
for
republicans
those
against
the
proenforcement
movement
also
use
inaccurate
generalizations
insinuating
that
hispanic
voters
support
amnesty
in
fact
many
hispanic
voters
support
efforts
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
republican
latino
candidates
in
florida
new
mexico
and
nevada
all
of
which
have
large
hispanic
populations
won
statewide
races
while
calling
for
enhanced
border
security
and
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
instead
of
amnesty
the
proenforcement
movement
is
not
strictly
republican
it
is
american
and
it
is
not
antihispanic
it
is
proruleoflaw
time
and
again
american
voters
have
overwhelmingly
defeated
amnesty
attempts
including
the
2007
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
last
years
push
for
the
dream
act
to
attract
even
more
hispanic
voters
in
the
future
republicans
should
continue
to
emphasize
our
shared
values
of
economic
opportunity
national
security
and
education
the
united
states
was
founded
upon
the
rule
of
law
and
proenforcement
policies
uphold
this
american
legacy
the
internal
revenue
service
enforces
tax
law
even
though
the
majority
of
americans
do
not
enjoy
paying
taxes
why
because
all
americans
are
required
to
play
by
the
same
rules
the
same
goes
for
immigration
laws
amnesty
sends
the
message
to
illegal
immigrants
and
illegal
bordercrossers
that
we
do
not
take
our
immigration
laws
seriously
that
undoubtedly
would
lead
to
unsustainable
levels
of
illegal
immigration
we
are
a
nation
of
immigrants
but
in
order
to
sustain
the
high
levels
of
legal
immigration
we
have
immigration
laws
must
be
enforced
allowing
millions
to
evade
our
laws
is
unfair
and
hurts
american
workers
and
taxpayers
