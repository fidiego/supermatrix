congress
is
poised
for
the
first
major
rethinking
of
us
immigration
policy
in
30
years
it
is
practical
and
necessary
that
this
revamp
ultimately
include
an
evenhanded
carefully
considered
reduction
in
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
to
the
united
states
in
a
massive
piece
of
pending
house
immigration
legislation
the
working
number
for
that
reduction
is
30
percent
from
about
800000
annually
now
to
no
more
than
535000
by
the
year
2001
we
have
no
confidence
that
this
is
a
magic
number
but
it
follows
the
recommendations
of
the
bipartisan
barbara
jordan
commission
on
immigration
reform
and
a
30
percent
cut
does
address
genuine
pressures
solid
fair
immigration
reform
and
responsible
policies
behind
the
popular
politics
however
require
much
more
work
before
congress
acts
the
first
step
is
to
separate
consideration
of
illegal
immigration
management
from
policymaking
on
legal
immigration
the
house
will
do
the
quality
and
ethics
of
the
debate
great
justice
by
breaking
out
provisions
on
illegal
immigration
for
imminent
consideration
and
then
addressing
legal
immigration
issues
separately
legal
immigrants
and
refugees
should
not
be
lumped
with
people
who
do
not
play
by
the
rules
and
work
the
system
honestly
by
separating
the
issues
congress
also
goes
a
fair
way
toward
the
obligation
to
say
that
this
nation
of
immigrants
is
enriched
by
diversity
as
well
as
being
a
nation
challenged
sometimes
to
handle
the
social
costs
of
immigration
precisely
because
of
its
richness
domestic
policy
on
immigration
cannot
be
considered
outside
the
context
of
an
american
foreign
policy
that
tries
to
help
solve
the
worldwide
problems
that
are
spawning
human
migrations
of
epic
proportion
the
simple
truth
is
that
most
folks
leave
their
homes
only
when
they
are
unsafe
because
of
political
strife
or
where
the
local
economy
does
not
sustain
them
as
a
practical
matter
of
immigration
management
it
is
perverse
for
congress
to
thwart
us
foreign
policies
that
promote
democracybuilding
and
economic
growth
elsewhere
the
federal
debate
about
immigration
policy
will
ripen
for
sure
next
year
there
are
tough
issues
especially
regarding
whether
legal
immigrants
are
entitled
to
the
same
social
benefits
as
citizens
and
how
to
define
family
members
in
setting
immigration
priorities
the
way
to
start
fairly
is
to
enact
reforms
in
illegal
immigration
control
first
and
to
acknowledge
that
immigration
is
an
international
issue
then
congress
will
be
in
an
appropriate
position
to
curtail
legal
immigration
to
sustainable
levels
