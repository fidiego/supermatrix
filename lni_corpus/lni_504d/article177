president
barack
obama
promised
he
would
pursue
immigration
reform
in
2009
healthcare
reform
pushed
everything
else
aside
however
and
the
president
vowed
to
work
with
congress
to
pass
an
immigration
bill
in
2010
for
the
most
part
immigrationreform
proponents
such
as
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
were
pleased
with
the
white
houses
commitment
but
in
an
interview
with
the
hill
last
month
gutierrez
warned
the
obama
administration
that
if
it
doesnt
make
a
concerted
effort
he
will
advise
latino
voters
to
stay
home
this
fall
with
less
than
six
months
to
go
before
the
election
immigrationreform
advocates
are
saying
the
president
must
do
much
more
obama
recently
said
he
was
unsure
if
congress
has
the
appetite
for
immigration
reform
and
backed
away
from
predicting
a
bill
will
pass
this
year
white
house
officials
have
noted
that
in
order
to
pass
an
immigration
bill
a
few
republicans
need
to
support
it
still
some
congressional
democrats
want
obama
to
put
his
foot
on
the
gas
as
he
did
with
healthcare
reform
sen
robert
menendez
dnj
who
has
said
that
if
immigration
reform
doesnt
pass
this
year
it
could
be
many
years
before
it
is
enacted
has
called
on
obama
to
hold
a
healthcarelike
bipartisan
summit
on
immigration
the
white
house
has
not
embraced
menendezs
advice
backers
of
immigration
reform
many
of
whom
embraced
hillary
clintons
candidacy
for
president
in
2008
want
to
see
a
bill
on
the
senate
floor
this
year
if
republicans
block
it
that
will
be
clear
to
voters
and
they
will
decide
whether
it
is
a
good
thing
or
not
what
they
dont
want
is
for
democrats
to
give
up
before
they
have
put
the
effort
in
immigration
reform
is
politically
sensitive
because
the
country
is
divided
over
whether
to
emphasize
border
security
or
a
path
to
citizenship
there
are
dozens
of
house
democrats
who
do
not
share
gutierrezs
views
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason
why
speaker
nancy
pelosi
dcalif
has
said
the
senate
must
go
first
on
immigration
reform
republicans
tackled
the
issue
in
the
election
year
of
2006
and
the
issue
divided
them
democrats
for
the
most
part
sat
back
and
months
later
they
controlled
congress
hoping
to
strike
a
deal
with
president
george
w
bush
in
2007
democrats
tried
to
broker
a
deal
but
the
bill
died
in
the
last
congress
obama
has
repeatedly
said
he
is
willing
to
tackle
the
tough
issues
not
wanting
to
push
them
to
his
successor
immigration
reform
is
as
tough
as
it
gets
