all
agree
that
the
time
has
come

pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
it
is
time
to
address
the
issue
we
are
paying
an
economic
and
human
cost
for
a
broken
immigration
system
we
must
take
action
to
integrate
the
productivity
and
humanity
of
immigrants
into
our
country
from
an
economic
standpoint
undocumented
immigrants
are
actually
contributing
to
our
economy
now
in

an
updated
study
by
the
university
of
cincinnati
estimated
that
hispanic
workers
including
undocumented
lowwage
immigrants
have
an
annual
economic
impact
of
more
than
3
billion
in
the
100
billion

reform
will
bring
these
job
creators
out
of
the
shadows
and
they
will
have
an
even
greater
impact
on
our
economy

reform
is
necessary
to
recognize
the
human
dignity
of
all
people
in
our
society
faith
communities
across
the
nation
and
in

are
working

have
been
called
for
by
us
catholic
bishops
provide
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
the
undocumented

citizenship
will
bring
the
undocumented
out
of
the
shadows
stabilize
the
workforce
improve
our
economy
and
promote
family
unity
protect
families
an
immigration
system
should
protect
families
it
currently
takes
years
for
families
to
be
united
this
creates
an
incentive
for
more
undocumented
immigration
provide
opportunities
for
low
and
unskilled
workers
agriculture
and
service
sector
businesses
have
an
unmet
need
for
low
and
unskilled
labor
incorporating
the
ability
for
foreignborn
workers
to
enter
the
country
safely
and
legally
would
reduce
undocumented
immigration
and
address
business
needs
in
our
country
reform
should
also
include
workplace
protections
living
wage
levels
and
safeguards
against
worker
displacement
restore
due
process
due
process
rights
eliminated
by
the
1996

responsibility
act
should
be
restored
address
root
causes
of
immigration
american
policies
should
address
the
root
causes
of
migration
and
seek
longterm
solutions
economic
development
and
living
wage
jobs
in
sending
countries
will
reduce
the
pressure
on
human
beings
to
migrate
reform
should
also
include
the
dream
act
a
bipartisan
bill
first
introduced
in
the
senate
in
2001
the
dream
act
will
provide
conditional
permanent
residency
to
students
who
came
to
this
country
as
young
children
and
have
graduated
from
high
school
for
many
this
is
the
only
country
they
know
they
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
become
full
americans
and
contribute
to
our
country
it
is
time
for
immigration
reform
we
must
move
away
from
the
politics
of
fear
and
bigotry
and
recognize
the
humanity
and
american
spirit
in
those
who
were
driven
or
attracted
to
this
country
by
economic
or
political
conditions
beyond
their
control
americans
from
across
the
political
spectrum
should
unite
with
faith
communities
and
advocate
for
a
comprehensive
solution
it
will
create
a
more
perfect
union
and
continue
the
american
story
of
immigration
that
has
made
us
the
greatest
country
on
earth
