the
justice
department
has
quietly
expanded
its
power
to
detain
foreigners
letting
the
government
keep
a
foreigner
behind
bars
even
after
a
federal
immigration
judge
has
ordered
him
to
be
released
for
lack
of
evidence
the
change
allows
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
set
aside
any
release
order
issued
by
an
immigration
judge
in
cases
where
the
agency
says
it
believes
that
a
foreigner
is
a
danger
to
the
community
or
a
flight
risk
to
have
such
a
ruling
set
aside
the
service
simply
has
to
file
a
form
that
says
it
plans
to
appeal
the
decision
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
if
that
board
orders
the
detainee
released
the
service
can
also
set
aside
that
order
under
the
new
regulation
by
taking
the
case
to
the
attorney
general
immigration
lawyers
who
represent
many
of
the
1100
noncitizens
held
after
the
attacks
on
sept
11
are
furious
about
the
new
rule
saying
it
deprives
the
detainees
of
the
fundamental
right
of
bond
hearings
at
such
hearings
analogous
to
bond
proceedings
in
the
criminal
justice
system
immigration
judges
weigh
the
evidence
to
decide
whether
a
detainee
should
be
allowed
to
be
freed
on
bond
but
now
no
matter
the
outcome
of
those
hearings
the
government
can
continue
to
hold
detainees
by
filing
forms
in
one
business
day
with
this
rule
change
the
government
can
lock
someone
up
on
very
little
or
even
no
evidence
and
throw
away
the
key
until
they
decide
to
let
them
go
said
david
w
leopold
an
immigration
lawyer
in
cleveland
who
represents
the
first
aliens
affected
by
the
new
rule
11
israelis
who
continued
to
be
detained
after
a
judge
had
ordered
them
released
in
effect
it
just
takes
immigration
judges
out
of
the
mix
bypassing
their
role
entirely
two
israelis
remain
in
custody
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
it
planned
to
challenge
the
rule
in
court
as
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
right
of
due
process
for
foreigners
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
said
the
rule
along
with
actions
that
permit
eavesdropping
on
detainees
conversation
with
their
lawyers
violated
constitutional
protections
previously
the
immigration
service
could
set
aside
judges
rulings
only
in
cases
of
clearcut
criminal
activity
situations
that
are
unusual
because
judges
generally
impose
high
or
no
bail
in
such
cases
the
new
rule
signed
by
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
on
oct
26
went
into
effect
on
oct
29
with
no
public
notice
it
was
published
in
the
federal
register
on
oct
31
eliminating
the
usual
comment
period
before
a
federal
rule
takes
effect
mr
ashcroft
determined
that
swift
action
was
necessary
to
prevent
the
release
of
aliens
who
may
pose
a
threat
to
national
security
the
immigration
service
part
of
the
justice
department
said
the
rule
was
necessary
because
the
current
system
might
require
the
release
of
aliens
who
pose
security
threats
before
the
agency
could
present
its
case
to
the
appeals
board
because
of
the
heavy
ins
caseload
officials
said
it
is
occasionally
impossible
to
present
all
the
necessary
evidence
to
an
immigration
judge
its
not
that
we
dont
have
the
direct
evidence
but
in
some
cases
we
simply
havent
had
time
to
draft
enough
material
to
prepare
a
warrant
a
spokeswoman
for
the
agency
karen
kraushaar
said
immigration
lawyers
said
in
many
cases
such
evidence
of
terrorist
links
did
not
exist
or
was
based
on
flimsy
connections
like
a
similar
last
name
to
a
hijacker
or
possession
of
a
box
cutter
in
other
cases
the
government
has
refused
to
disclose
its
evidence
to
judges
citing
national
security
reasons
immigration
judges
rarely
release
detainees
when
the
government
presents
virtually
any
evidence
of
danger
but
in
the
current
cases
several
judges
have
ordered
releases
because
of
a
lack
of
evidence
over
the
objections
of
the
immigration
service
the
220
immigration
judges
are
civil
service
employees
of
the
justice
department
they
were
separated
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
1983
to
strengthen
their
independence
though
the
judges
usually
side
with
the
immigration
service
on
deportations
studies
show
that
they
frequently
impose
lower
bail
than
the
service
requests
in
detention
cases
some
legal
scholars
say
the
new
regulation
stems
from
longstanding
misgivings
immigration
service
officials
have
about
the
judges
the
immigration
judges
were
intended
to
be
a
check
on
the
ins
a
set
of
decision
makers
who
were
not
beholden
to
the
agency
said
margaret
taylor
a
professor
of
law
at
wake
forest
university
but
within
the
ins
is
a
fundamental
mistrust
of
the
immigration
judges
supporters
of
the
agency
however
say
the
new
regulation
is
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
focus
on
terrorism
richard
samp
chief
counsel
of
the
washington
legal
foundation
said
that
immigration
judges
might
be
inclined
to
release
detainees
when
the
government
based
its
actions
on
classified
information
but
that
the
government
had
every
right
not
to
enter
such
information
as
evidence
the
attorney
general
has
access
to
large
amounts
of
classified
evidence
and
has
no
interest
in
publicly
disclosing
it
which
would
happen
in
an
administrative
proceeding
said
mr
samp
whose
group
has
filed
briefs
to
support
the
agency
we
dont
think
theres
any
constitutional
problem
with
that
when
you
disclose
you
inform
you
give
terrorists
a
road
map
to
american
intelligencegathering
techniques
the
nations
chief
immigration
judge
michael
j
creppy
declined
a
request
for
an
interview
his
spokesman
richard
kenney
said
judge
creppy
did
not
believe
that
the
new
rule
undermined
the
authority
or
purpose
of
the
immigration
courts
this
doesnt
change
the
decisionmaking
role
of
the
judges
mr
kenney
said
it
does
mean
that
the
execution
is
a
little
softer
and
the
ins
gets
more
discretion
over
the
years
congress
has
granted
wide
authority
to
the
justice
department
to
run
the
immigration
system
the
attorney
general
appoints
the
chief
immigration
judge
and
can
change
the
detention
rules
by
administrative
order
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
found
that
foreigners
do
have
some
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
as
recently
as
june
the
court
ruled
that
the
government
could
not
hold
foreigners
indefinitely
because
they
are
persons
under
constitutional
protection
civil
libertarians
said
that
the
new
rule
violated
the
spirit
of
that
decision
clearly
theres
a
concern
for
security
at
the
moment
and
we
recognize
that
said
judy
rabinovitz
senior
staff
counsel
for
the
immigrants
rights
project
of
the
aclu
but
were
concerned
that
theyre
taking
advantage
of
the
public
mood
to
go
too
far
if
you
say
youre
going
to
ignore
a
judges
ruling
because
you
disagree
with
it
it
turns
a
bond
hearing
into
a
farce
