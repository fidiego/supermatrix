hardcore
proponents
of
californias
proposition
187
are
seething
at
us
district
judge
mariana
r
pfaelzers
decision
to
nullify
most
of
the
notorious
antiimmigration
initiative
as
unconstitutional
but
she
did
them
a
big
favor
in
tossing
the
most
muddled
and
meanspirited
elements
of
the
controversial
initiative
in
the
legal
trash
bin
where
they
belong
pfaelzer
has
virtually
guaranteed
that
congress
will
now
finish
rewriting
the
nations
immigration
laws
pretty
much
as
most
people
who
voted
for
proposition
187
wanted
to
stop
illegal
immigration
but
congress
is
likely
to
do
a
smarter
more
balanced
job
of
it
than
the
assortment
of
political
hacks
and
antiimmigrant
wackos
who
threw
proposition
187
together
that
is
what
proposition
187s
more
astute
backers
like
that
smart
hypocrite
gov
pete
wilson
wanted
all
along
they
hoped
to
create
political
momentum
for
immigration
reform
california
attorney
general
dan
lungren
who
wants
to
run
for
governor
when
wilsons
term
ends
is
in
the
best
position
to
benefit
from
this
latest
turn
of
events
a
former
member
of
congress
who
worked
on
immigration
issues
while
on
capitol
hill
in
the
1980s
lungren
knows
that
any
appeal
on
proposition
187s
behalf
will
take
years
to
reach
the
us
supreme
court
and
still
runs
the
risk
of
losing
lungren
should
let
immigration
restrictionist
groups
waste
their
time
and
money
on
that
process
while
he
and
other
california
officials
help
work
out
a
compromise
on
the
immigration
issue
the
outlines
of
an
immigration
compromise
are
there
the
compromise
starts
with
hr
2202
the
hodgepodge
immigration
bill
by
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
as
often
happens
when
faraway
washington
policymakers
react
to
a
grassroots
issue
like
proposition
187
smith
overdid
it
his
bill
not
only
proposes
tighter
border
controls
and
other
measures
to
halt
illegal
immigration
on
which
there
is
wide
consensus
but
it
also
mixes
apples
in
with
the
oranges
by
trying
to
restrict
legal
immigration
as
well
there
is
no
consensus
that
legal
immigration
needs
to
be
slowed
except
among
the
fringe
groups
that
see
immigration
as
a
greater
threat
to
the
nation
than
budget
deficits
aids
or
global
warming
thats
why
conservative
republican
house
members
from
california
are
demanding
that
measures
affecting
legal
immigrants
be
taken
out
of
hr
2202
and
considered
separately
thats
an
eminently
sensible
stance
although
smith
has
so
far
resisted
efforts
to
break
his
bill
up
into
its
component
parts
but
now
a
new
player
has
entered
the
game
one
smith
will
have
a
harder
time
resisting
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
lobbying
groups
on
capitol
hill
us
agribusiness
smiths
subcommittee
is
quietly
planning
new
hearings
on
hr
2202
in
early
december
in
cooperation
with
the
house
agriculture
committee
according
to
several
capitol
hill
sources
the
prime
movers
in
this
process
are
two
californians
who
represent
the
states
central
valley
republican
richard
w
pombo
and
democrat
gary
a
condit
like
wilson
and
lungren
if
hes
smart
they
listen
when
agribusiness
talks
think
back
now
to
1986
and
the
last
great
immigration
reform
and
control
act
that
congress
enacted
the
process
took
almost
10
years
beginning
when
gerald
ford
was
president
and
ending
when
ronald
reagan
was
in
his
second
term
the
act
would
probably
not
have
passed
even
in
1986
but
for
a
big
concession
to
agribusiness
a
special
agricultural
workers
amnesty
program
that
legalized
more
than
1
million
immigrants
for
comparison
the
regular
amnesty
in
the
act
legalized
slightly
fewer
than
2
million
so
the
great
immigration
compromise
of
1996
thats
probably
when
it
will
happen
is
taking
shape
it
involves
more
border
control
to
cut
down
on
illegal
immigration
and
some
form
of
guest
worker
program
to
meet
farmers
labor
needs
like
pfaelzers
decision
to
toss
out
most
of
proposition
187
that
compromise
will
drive
hardcore
immigration
restrictionists
nuts
but
it
gives
the
rest
of
us
a
compromise
that
could
help
calm
the
angry
immigration
debate
that
proposition
187
symbolized
and
it
might
even
work
consider
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
statistics
indicate
that
50
percent
of
the
people
arrested
each
year
illegally
crossing
the
border
are
mexican
nationals
so
better
border
control
combined
with
a
mexican
guest
worker
program
solves
half
of
the
illegal
immigrant
problem
even
proposition
187s
most
ardent
backers
couldnt
guarantee
that
