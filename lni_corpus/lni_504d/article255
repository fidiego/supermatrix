the
bush
administration
increasingly
emphasized
partisan
political
ties
over
expertise
in
recent
years
in
selecting
the
judges
who
decide
the
fate
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigrants
despite
laws
that
preclude
such
considerations
according
to
an
analysis
by
the
washington
post
at
least
onethird
of
the
immigration
judges
appointed
by
the
justice
department
since
2004
have
had
republican
connections
or
have
been
administration
insiders
and
half
lacked
experience
in
immigration
law
justice
department
immigration
court
and
other
records
show
two
newly
appointed
immigration
judges
were
failed
candidates
for
the
us
tax
court
nominated
by
president
bush
one
fudged
his
taxes
and
the
other
was
deemed
unqualified
to
be
a
tax
judge
by
the
nations
largest
association
of
lawyers
both
were
republican
loyalists
justice
officials
also
gave
immigration
judgeships
to
a
new
jersey
election
law
specialist
who
represented
gop
candidates
a
former
treasurer
of
the
louisiana
republican
party
a
white
house
domestic
policy
adviser
and
a
conservative
crusader
against
pornography
these
appointments
all
made
by
the
attorney
general
have
begun
to
reshape
a
system
of
courts
in
which
judges
ruling
alone
exercise
broad
powers
deporting
each
year
nearly
a
quartermillion
immigrants
who
have
limited
rights
to
appeal
and
no
right
to
an
attorney
the
judges
do
not
serve
fixed
terms
department
officials
say
they
changed
their
hiring
practices
in
april
but
defend
their
selections
still
the
injection
of
political
considerations
into
the
selection
of
immigration
judges
has
attracted
congressional
attention
in
the
wake
of
controversy
over
the
bush
administrations
dismissal
last
year
of
nine
us
attorneys
the
post
analysis
is
the
first
systematic
examination
of
the
people
appointed
to
immigration
courts
the
relationships
that
led
to
their
selection
and
the
experience
they
brought
to
their
position
the
review
based
on
justice
records
and
research
into
the
judges
backgrounds
encompassed
the
37
current
judges
approved
by
attorney
general
alberto
r
gonzales
or
his
predecessor
john
d
ashcroft
starting
in
2004
that
year
is
when
the
justice
department
began
to
jettison
the
civil
service
process
that
traditionally
guided
the
selections
in
favor
of
political
considerations
according
to
sworn
congressional
testimony
by
one
senior
department
official
and
a
statement
by
the
lawyer
for
another
official
those
two
officials
d
kyle
sampson
and
monica
m
goodling
have
said
they
were
told
the
practice
was
legal
but
justice
spokesman
dean
boyd
said
that
immigration
judges
are
considered
civil
service
employees
who
may
not
be
chosen
based
on
political
factors
unlike
judges
in
federal
criminal
courts
all
the
judges
appointed
during
this
period
who
arrived
with
experience
in
immigration
law
were
prosecutors
or
held
other
immigration
enforcement
jobs
that
was
a
reversal
of
a
trend
during
the
clinton
administration
in
which
the
justice
department
sought
to
balance
such
appointees
with
ones
who
had
been
attorneys
representing
immigrants
according
to
current
and
former
immigration
judges
boyd
said
in
a
written
statement
that
judges
appointed
during
the
bush
administration
are
well
qualified
for
their
current
positions
and
that
outstanding
immigration
judges
can
come
from
diverse
backgrounds
boyd
also
said
that
race
and
ethnicity
are
not
factors
in
hiring
but
cited
statistics
showing
that
immigration
courts
are
considerably
more
diverse
than
other
kinds
of
courts
the
department
launched
a
new
hiring
program
in
april
that
requires
public
announcements
of
open
positions
and
detailed
evaluations
and
interviews
with
a
final
decision
still
in
the
hands
of
the
attorney
general
the
action
came
partly
in
response
to
a
lawsuit
by
a
veteran
immigration
counsel
who
alleged
discrimination
when
she
was
passed
over
for
two
judgeships
some
judges
and
other
immigration
experts
are
highly
critical
of
the
administrations
practice
of
placing
political
allies
on
the
courts
when
we
start
seeing
people
who
look
like
theyre
fulfilling
someones
political
debt
get
these
positions
it
starts
to
become
disturbing
said
crystal
williams
a
deputy
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
immigration
law
is
very
complex
said
denise
slavin
an
immigration
judge
since
1995
in
miami
who
is
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
a
union
so
generally
speaking
its
very
good
to
have
someone
coming
into
this
area
with
an
immigration
background
its
very
difficult
for
those
who
dont
to
catch
up
mike
hethmon
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
reform
law
institute
which
advocates
stricter
border
policies
said
however
that
a
strong
legal
background
is
more
important
than
immigration
experience
the
qualities
of
a
good
adjudicator
dont
necessarily
focus
on
the
subject
matter
he
said
since
sept
11
2001
the
bush
administration
has
said
it
is
employing
the
nations
54
immigration
courts
with
226
judges
as
a
central
tool
of
its
antiterrorism
policies
using
them
to
deport
hundreds
of
noncitizens
who
were
detained
as
terrorism
suspects
but
were
not
charged
with
crimes
in
2002
it
created
stiffer
guidelines
for
appeals
and
wrote
new
rules
sharply
reducing
the
number
of
judges
who
hear
them
partly
to
reduce
a
large
case
backlog
that
has
made
it
harder
for
people
deemed
unwanted
by
the
government
to
stay
in
the
country
the
infusion
of
politics
into
the
selection
of
judges
began
in
the
midst
of
this
transformation
of
the
court
system
sampson
and
goodling
who
participated
in
the
prosecutor
firings
did
not
say
which
immigration
judges
had
been
selected
for
their
political
leanings
but
records
and
interviews
reveal
the
republican
ties
of
many
one
was
glen
l
bower
whom
bush
initially
nominated
to
the
tax
court
he
was
never
confirmed
because
lawmakers
noted
that
his
amended
tax
returns
showed
he
had
taken
inappropriate
deductions
for
entertainment
gifts
and
meals
for
three
consecutive
years
a
former
republican
state
legislator
bower
was
the
revenue
director
to
thenillinois
gov
george
h
ryan
r
who
would
be
convicted
on
racketeering
and
fraud
charges
a
few
months
earlier
another
failed
tax
court
nominee
francis
l
cramer
a
former
campaign
treasurer
for
sen
judd
gregg
rnh
was
appointed
as
an
immigration
judge
cramers
bid
for
a
seat
on
the
tax
court
foundered
after
the
american
bar
associations
taxation
section
wrote
a
rare
letter
to
the
senate
finance
committee
saying
we
are
unable
to
conclude
that
he
is
qualified
to
serve
cramer
was
then
hired
by
the
justice
departments
tax
division
and
was
briefly
lent
to
the
departments
office
of
immigration
litigation
ashcroft
approved
him
as
an
immigration
judge
in
march
2004
the
government
accountability
office
a
legislative
watchdog
criticized
the
appointment
saying
converting
a
schedule
c
political
appointee
with
less
than
6
months
of
immigration
law
experience
to
an
immigration
judge
position
raises
questions
about
the
fairness
of
the
conversion
another
politically
connected
lawyer
garry
d
malphrus
was
appointed
to
arlingtons
immigration
court
in
2005
he
had
been
associate
director
of
the
white
house
domestic
policy
council
and
before
that
a
republican
aide
on
two
senate
judiciary
committee
subcommittees
during
the
florida
recount
after
the
2000
presidential
election
that
brought
bush
to
office
malphrus
took
part
in
the
brooks
brothers
riot
when
gop
staffers
from
washington
chanted
stop
the
fraud
at
miamis

other

for
governor
mark
h
metcalf
an
unsuccessful
republican
candidate
for
the
state
senate
and
us
congress
from
kentucky
who
went
on
to
several
positions
at
the
justice
department
unrelated
to
immigration
and
chris
a

a
former
texas
county
gop
chairman
who
had
been
named
by
bush
the
governor
at
the
time
to
the
states
library
and
archives
commission
bruce
a
taylor
who
was
appointed
as
an
immigration
judge
in
arizona
last
year
was
general
counsel
for
two
conservative
antipornography
groups
citizens
for
decency
through
law
and
the
national
law
center
for
children
and
families
taylor
also
worked
as
a
senior
counsel
in
the
criminal
division
at
the
justice
department
but
his
rsum
does
not
indicate
immigrationrelated
experience
like
other
immigration
judges
contacted
last
week
taylor
declined
to
comment
he
said
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
which
oversees
immigration
courts
had
instructed
immigration
judges
to
refer
questions
to
the
main
office
in
falls
church
a
spokeswoman
there
referred
questions
to
justice
headquarters
the
recent
pattern
of
hiring
for
immigration
judges
provoked
a
2005
lawsuit
by
the
governments
chief
immigration
lawyer
in
el
paso
for
22
years
guadalupe
gonzales
no
relation
to
the
attorney
general
alleged
she
was
denied
a
judgeship
twice
in
favor
of
lessqualified
white
men
who
were
hired
without
an
open
application
process
her
suit
alleged
that
between
2001
and
late
2005
only
two
latinos
were
appointed
nationwide
as
immigration
judges
justice
department
records
make
clear
that
the
immigration
bench
is
overwhelmingly
male
and
white
even
though
spanishspeaking
people
from
latin
america
make
up
at
least
70
percent
of
the
caseload
the
justice
department
responded
in
court
papers
that
gonzaless
lawsuit
should
be
thrown
out
it
argued
that
she
had
not
identified
a
discriminatory
practice
and
that
immigration
judges
did
not
have
be
hired
as
part
of
a
competitive
process
it
said
that
all
but
four
immigration
judges
chosen
during
the
period
in
contention
from
late
2003
to
2006
were
hired
