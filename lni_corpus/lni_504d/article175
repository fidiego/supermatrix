prospects
for
an
immigration
overhaul
are
fizzling
this
year
and
some
democratic
lawmakers
are
focusing
blame
on
the
pugnacious
democratic
operative
who
works
just
down
the
hall
from
president
barack
obama
rahm
emanuel
white
house
chief
of
staff
and
longtime
party
strategist
has
argued
privately
that
its
a
bad
time
for
democrats
to
push
an
immigration
bill
a
potential
land
mine
in
the
midst
of
a
crucial
midterm
election
emanuels
stance
coupled
with
his
longheld
wariness
about
the
politics
of
immigration
is
emboldening
key
democrats
to
come
forward
and
ask
that
he
step
aside
from
the
issue
theres
always
a
sense
that
no
matter
how
hard
we
work
to
get
through
the
white
house
we
have
to
get
through
rahm
said
us
rep
raul
grijalva
dariz
i
would
like
immigration
not
to
be
part
of
the
chief
of
staffs
portfolio
it
would
make
our
ability
to
convince
and
access
decisionmakers
in
the
white
house
a
lot
easier
emanuel
has
a
complicated
history
with
the
immigration
question
dating
back
to
the
1990s
as
a
top
aide
to
former
president
bill
clinton
he
stressed
the
message
that
clinton
was
hardnosed
about
policing
illegal
immigration
later
as
a
chicago
congressman
who
took
on
the
assignment
of
installing
more
democrats
in
the
house
emanuel
cautioned
that
immigration
was
the
third
rail
of
american
politics
dangerous
to
those
who
touch
it
now
as
obamas
top
aide
emanuel
has
argued
much
the
same
thing
in
private
meetings
he
has
warned
that
pressing
ahead
with
an
immigration
bill
could
jeopardize
the
chances
of
moderate
and
conservative
democratic
candidates
in
the
runup
to
the
midterms
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
a
practiced
nosecounter
emanuel
has
also
questioned
whether
there
are
enough
republican
votes
to
help
pass
a
bill
that
among
other
things
would
provide
a
path
to
legal
status
for
the
11
million
immigrants
living
here
illegally
democratic
lawmakers
and
advocates
who
have
clashed
with
emanuel
over
the
years
fear
that
immigration
is
destined
to
be
a
secondtier
priority
so
long
as
he
is
in
his
current
role
its
going
to
be
much
easier
for
this
issue
to
move
after
rahm
emanuel
leaves
the
white
house
said
simon
rosenberg
president
of
the
new
democratic
network
a
think
tank
rahm
has
a
long
history
of
a
lack
of
sympathy
for
the
importance
of
the
immigration
issue
a
white
house
spokesman
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
with
time
running
out
the
chances
of
an
immigration
overhaul
this
year
are
receding
no
bill
has
yet
been
introduced
in
the
senate
come
june
the
chamber
will
be
enmeshed
in
the
confirmation
of
supreme
court
nominee
elena
kagan
certainly
obama
has
shown
he
is
in
no
rush
at
a
mexican
heritage
event
earlier
this
month
obama
said
he
merely
wanted
to
begin
work
on
the
issue
this
year
not
complete
a
bill
in
that
time
frame
yet
as
a
candidate
in
2008
obama
promised
to
address
immigration
in
his
first
year
in
office
emanuel
is
part
of
a
cluster
of
democratic
political
operatives
and
pollsters
who
have
seen
immigration
as
treacherous
terrain
us
sen
robert
menendez
dnj
said
that
when
emanuel
chaired
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
in
the
2006
election
cycle
he
believed
the
question
of
immigration
is
a
political
liability
to
a
series
of
members
and
i
dont
know
anything
that
has
changed
his
mind
on
that
in
washington
emanuel
once
lived
in
the
basement
of
the
house
of
stan
greenberg
a
former
clinton
pollster
greenberg
and
others
wrote
a
memo
in
2007
warning
that
many
democratic
voters
take
a
hardline
position
on
immigration
which
they
called
a
real
wedge
issue
around
the
same
time
emanuel
described
immigration
as
a
political
third
rail
proponents
of
reform
said
rahm
emanuel
threw
immigrants
under
the
bus
advocate
frank
sharry
said
at
the
time
by
that
point
a
bitter
rift
had
developed
between
emanuel
then
a
house
member
and
some
members
of
the
congressional
hispanic
caucus
or
chc
in
2005
some
in
the
caucus
withheld
their
democratic
dues
out
of
frustration
with
party
leaders
including
emanuel
they
objected
that
dues
money
was
going
to
vulnerable
democrats
who
for
reelection
purposes
were
taking
a
strict
stance
on
illegal
immigration
rep
joe
baca
dcalif
said
in
an
interview
every
member
of
the
chc
was
very
concerned
with
rahm
emanuel
i
know
rahm
had
a
duty
to
protect
the
marginal
members
but
that
was
also
going
against
some
of
our
principles
in
what
we
stood
for
in
trying
to
deal
with
comprehensive
immigration
immigration
was
part
of
emanuels
portfolio
when
he
worked
for
bill
clinton
in
the
1990s
part
of
emanuels
job
was
making
sure
that
clintons
enforcement
efforts
were
publicized
the
idea
was
to
portray
clinton
as
a
different
kind
of
democrat
who
made
lawandorder
a
focus
doris
meissner
a
former
head
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
said
she
spoke
to
emanuel
in
those
years
immigration
was
one
of
the
things
he
emanuel
monitored
and
he
had
a
very
strong
sense
that
enforcement
needed
to
be
visible
emanuels
history
makes
immigration
advocates
uneasy
deepak
bhargava
executive
director
of
the
center
for
community
change
said
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
the
president
doesnt
come
out
swinging
aggressively
on
immigration
rightly
or
wrongly
a
lot
of
fingers
will
be
pointed
at
rahm
