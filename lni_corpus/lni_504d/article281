sophomore
maria
cervantes
was
not
comfortable
discussing
illegal
immigration
she
didnt
think
she
understood
the
issue
well
enough
to
speak
about
it
thats
why
she
forced
herself
to
go
to
a
meeting
tuesday
night
cervantes
and
140
other
middle
school
and
high
school
students
and
teachers
from
newportmesa
unified
gathered
to
discuss
one
of
the
most
contentious
topics
in
their
community
and
across
the
country
the
forum
was
organized
by
neighbors
for
a
safe
community
a
group
of
about
50
area
residents
and
business
owners
that
formed
last
year
the
group
says
a
lot
of
emotion
and
not
much
rational
thinking
has
surrounded
the
illegal
immigration
issue
in
costa
mesa
taco
mesa
restaurant
cosponsored
the
event
and
provided
free
dinners
the
goal
was
to
encourage
civic
participation
by
high
school
students
help
educate
them
on
the
topic
and
provide
students
with
a
productive
arena
to
have
their
voices
heard
said
organizer
chris
blank
a
costa
mesa
resident
and
attorney
in
newport
beach
another
goal
was
to
encourage
students
to
register
to
vote
at
18
we
are
not
here
to
tell
students
what
they
should
or
should
not
do
about
immigration
we
are
here
to
give
them
the
opportunity
and
the
tools
to
decide
for
themselves
blank
said
the
city
became
involved
in
the
national
debate
this
year
after
mayor
allan
mansoor
proposed
legislation
to
have
costa
mesa
police
check
the
immigration
status
of
suspects
charged
with
felonies
it
would
make
costa
mesa
the
first
us
city
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
program
is
awaiting
federal
approval
in
recent
months
the
city
has
been
a
target
of
boycotts
and
rallies
by
immigrantrights
groups
and
those
supporting
stronger
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
organizers
of
tuesdays
event
have
opposed
the
costa
mesas
immigration
enforcement
plan
but
said
the
purpose
of
the
forum
was
not
to
influence
students
speakers
from
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
mexicanamerican
legal
defense
fund
talked
to
students
about
the
roles
and
responsibilities
of
the
federal
state
and
local
governments
when
it
comes
to
immigration
they
also
outlined
the
federal
immigration
measures
currently
before
congress
and
costa
mesas
immigration
enforcement
plan
students
then
sat
in
small
groups
and
answered
questions
like
how
have
you
personally
been
affected
by
the
immigration
debate
and
what
specific
things
can
high
school
students
do
to
influence
local
and
national
immigration
policy

freshman
sindy
ramirez
said
the
mayors
proposal
has
caused
a
lot
of
fear
and
concern
in
her
neighborhood
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
and
family
who
are
illegal
immigrants
they
all
work
really
hard
and
also
contribute
to
the
community
ramirez
said
i
dont
understand
what
the
big
deal
is
at
one
point
everybody
in
this
country
came
from
somewhere
else
mary
christensen
a
history
teacher
at
corona
del
mar
high
said
she
hoped
students
didnt
walk
away
from
the
meeting
thinking
they
it
was
ok
to
ignore
immigration
laws
i
couldnt
sit
here
as
an
educator
and
have
students
think
they
could
respect
certain
laws
and
not
others
just
because
they
might
not
like
them

belinda
escobosa
helzer
an
attorney
with
the
aclu
said
despite
the
differing
views
on
illegal
immigration
open
dialogue
was
the
best
tool
for
students
to
grasp
the
complexity
of
the
issue
i
wish
i
had
the
opportunity
you
guys
had
to
talk
about
this
difficult
issue
when
i
was
in
high
school
immigration
is
not
a
black
and
white
issue
like
many
politicians
will
have
you
believe
she
told
students
first
thing
students
can
do
is
ask
questions
and
thats
what
you
guys
are
doing
tonight
