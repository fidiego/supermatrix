immigration
policy
is
tough
for
any
president
just
ask
george
w
bush
who
tried
and
failed
to
get
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
included
a
guestworker
program
which
opponents
in
his
own
party
said
would
lead
to
amnesty
for
illegal
aliens
president
obama
finds
himself
in
the
same
kind
of
hornets
nest
on
immigration
and
again
its
many
in
his
own
party
as
well
as
republicans
who
are
unhappy
with
his
stand
obama
wants
comprehensive
reform
including
a
process
allowing
illegal
aliens
in
this
country
to
gain
residency
by
paying
back
taxes
undergoing
background
checks
and
waiting
their
place
in
line
behind
others
seeking
to
come
to
the
united
states
meanwhile
obamas
justice
department
is
suing
to
block
arizonas
tough
antiillegal
immigrant
law
which
is
scheduled
to
go
into
effect
next
week
the
political
fallout
is
not
encouraging
for
obama
according
to
recent
reports
the
white
houses
infatuation
with
immigration
reform
is
a
loselose
proposal
for
democrats
this
election
year
a
senior
democratic
aide
told
time
talk
of
immigration
angers
independents
at
the
same
time
angering
hispanics
because
there
is
more
talk
and
no
action
just
in
time
for
an
election
western
democrats
uneasy
democratic
governors
particularly
those
in
the
west
are
very
uneasy
about
the
administrations
thrust
on
immigration
especially
in
light
of
the
nations
troubled
economy
this
is
an
issue
that
divides
us
politically
and
im
hopeful
that
their
strategy
doesnt
do
that
in
a
way
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
candidates
to
get
elected
democratic
governor
bill
ritter
jr
of
colorado
whos
not
seeking
reelection
told
the
new
york
times
universally
the
governors
are
saying
weve
got
to
talk
about
jobs
gov
phil
bredesen
d
of
tennessee
told
the
times
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
immigration
going
on
meanwhile
republicans
officials
around
the
country
are
organizing
in
support
of
arizona
against
the
justice
department
lawsuit
last
week
the
attorneys
general
of
eight
states
all
republicans
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
federal
court
supporting
arizonas
tough
new
immigration
law
it
is
appalling
to
see
president
obama
use
taxpayer
dollars
to
stop
a
states
efforts
to
protect
its
own
borders
said
michigan
attorney
general
mike
cox
in
a
statement
my
mother
was
a
legal
immigrant
who
faithfully
carried
her
green
card
with
her
for
years
before
gaining
citizenship
it
certainly
is
not
too
much
to
ask
legal
immigrants
to
do
the
same
today
as
obama
and
others
decry
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
as
reason
to
assert
federal
authority
over
immigration
most
states
appear
to
be
going
it
alone
at
an
accelerating
pace
states
passing
more
immigration
laws
between
2006
and
2009
the
number
of
state
bills
and
new
laws
related
to
immigration
more
than
doubled
according
to
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
state
legislators
in
45
states
had
introduced
1180
bills
and
resolutions
relating
to
immigrants
and
refugees
ncsl
reported
in
may
most
americans
support
stiffer
laws
against
illegal
immigration
polls
show
gallup
reported
this
month
that
americans
initial
reactions
to
the
us
justice
department
lawsuit
against
arizonas
new
illegal
immigration
law
are
more
negative
than
positive
by
a
50
percent
to
33
percent
margin
this
means
the
obama
administration
is
sailing
against
the
tide
of
public
opinion
in
its
efforts
to
block
the
law
reports
gallup
as
the
debate
continues
so
does
the
stream
of
immigrants
entering
the
us
illegally
from
mexico
the
center
for
immigration
recently
posted
its
second
hiddencamera
video
of
illegal
border
crossings
some
involving
guns
and
drugs
the
inescapable
conclusion
is
that
hidden
cameras
reveal
a
reality
that
illegalalien
activity
is
escalating
