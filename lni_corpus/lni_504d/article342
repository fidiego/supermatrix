even
as
the
number
of
immigrants
seeking
permanent
residency
in
the
united
states
grows
the
backlog
and
waiting
times
for
applicants
have
declined
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
said
today
at
present
someone
applying
for
a
green
card
granting
permanent
residency
must
wait
an
average
of
12
to
15
months
down
from
33
months
in
1999
officials
said
the
wait
varies
greatly
by
region
with
some
cities
like
houston
and
new
york
faring
worse
than
the
national
average
the
backlog
of
applicants
in
the
fiscal
year
2001
dipped
to
980000
people
just
below
the
peak
of
more
than
one
million
people
a
year
earlier
the
backlog
had
grown
steadily
from
121000
people
in
1994
causing
delays
for
students
refugees
spouses
of
permanent
residents
temporary
workers
sponsored
by
employers
and
other
applicants
immigration
officials
ascribe
the
declining
backlog
and
waiting
times
to
several
factors
the
immigration
service
has
hired
1200
more
adjudicators
in
the
last
three
years
for
a
total
of
6559
the
budget
for
processing
citizenship
and
other
service
claims
increased
to
650
million
this
year
from
440
million
in
the
fiscal
year
1999
and
officials
have
bought
new
computers
were
beginning
to
turn
the
corner
an
immigration
official
said
were
catching
up
the
bush
administration
and
its
new
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
james
ziglar
have
set
a
goal
to
process
all
claims
for
permanent
residency
within
six
months
immigration
officials
said
the
goal
was
to
meet
that
national
average
by
this
october
and
for
all
regional
offices
to
meet
it
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
2003
there
are
large
pockets
of
improvement
said
michael
maggio
an
immigration
lawyer
here
who
said
he
had
noticed
faster
service
for
clients
in
washington
and
baltimore
but
other
immigration
lawyers
and
immigrant
advocates
were
skeptical
about
the
agencys
rosier
numbers
and
forecasts
of
improved
service
it
sounds
wonderful
but
i
dont
buy
it
said
joanne
c
adlerstein
head
of
the
immigration
law
practice
at
proskauer
rose
in
newark
i
have
not
seen
any
improved
efficiency
ms
adlerstein
said
she
told
many
of
her
clients
that
they
would
probably
get
speedier
service
if
they
returned
to
their
home
countries
and
applied
for
immigrant
visas
from
there
people
wait
in
limbo
forever
for
years
so
what
theyre
saying
is
promising
said
sara
t
campos
a
staff
lawyer
for
the
national
immigration
law
center
in
oakland
calif
but
itll
take
awhile
for
it
to
filter
down
the
backlog
in
adjusting
immigrants
legal
status
stems
from
the
mid1990s
when
the
immigration
service
facing
mounting
delays
in
processing
citizenship
applications
shifted
resources
to
address
that
problem
that
starved
other
parts
of
the
immigration
bureaucracy
which
were
unable
to
keep
pace
with
a
growing
number
of
applicants
seeking
to
change
their
legal
status
changes
in
the
law
also
fueled
big
increases
in
applicants
congress
last
year
briefly
reinstated
a
process
that
allowed
many
illegal
immigrants
to
apply
for
legal
residency
without
first
having
to
return
to
their
country
of
origin
as
many
as
400000
immigrants
met
the
original
filing
deadline
april
30
2001
after
paying
a
1000
fee
to
avoid
having
to
return
to
their
home
country
the
total
number
of
new
applicants
for
permanent
residency
in
the
fiscal
year
2001
jumped
sharply
to
754000
from
456000
in
the
fiscal
year
1999
immigration
officials
said
the
increased
personnel
and
better
computers
allowed
them
to
approve
695000
filings
last
year
compared
with
264000
in
1999
even
before
the
attacks
on
sept
11
applicants
underwent
background
checks
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
and
the
central
intelligence
agency
since
the
attacks
arab
and
muslim
immigrants
who
have
applied
for
citizenship
and
other
services
have
faced
increased
scrutiny
immigration
lawyers
said
lawyers
for
arab
and
muslim
clients
said
that
the
number
of
applications
accepted
by
the
immigration
service
had
not
declined
since
the
attacks
and
that
the
processing
times
were
consistent
with
those
of
other
applicants
but
the
lawyers
said
their
clients
faced
more
questions
than
nonarabs
there
has
been
a
greater
scrutiny
of
naturalization
applications
as
well
as
other
applications
when
it
comes
to
arabs
and
muslims
said
ashraf
nubani
an
immigration
lawyer
in
springfield
va
mr
nubani
said
60
percent
of
his
clients
were
arab
and
muslim
immigrants
of
legal
resident
status
this
may
be
an
unspoken
type
of
thing
he
said
the
ins
may
have
sept
11
in
the
back
of
their
minds
of
particular
interest
to
immigration
officials
mr
nubani
said
were
the
previous
addresses
employment
records
and
travel
histories
of
his
clients
prior
to
sept
11
i
would
not
have
gotten
the
scrutiny
on
these
applications
that
i
have
gotten
since
