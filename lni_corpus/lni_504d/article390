words
as
the
congressional
debate
over
immigration
heats
up
powerful
elements
of
the
american
business
community
are
entering
the
fray
to
oppose
major
proposed
cuts
in
legal
immigration
that
many
companies
fear
would
inhibit
their
ability
to
compete
in
the
global
economy
dozens
of
executives
from
leading
hightech
firms
yesterday
descended
on
capitol
hill
to
argue
for
separating
the
issues
of
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
proposed
legislation
that
is
moving
through
the
house
and
taking
shape
in
the
senate
the
lobbying
effort
reflects
concerns
among
us
companies
that
their
ability
to
hire
highly
skilled
foreign
talent
as
legal
immigrants
will
become
ensnared
in
a
political
backlash
against
illegal
immigration
legal
immigration
strengthens
and
energizes
america
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
which
counts
13500
corporate
members
nationwide
said
in
a
statement
americas
hightech
employees
and
international
personnel
should
not
be
considered
in
the
same
bill
as
undocumented
entrants
and
criminal
law
violators
the
main
target
of
the
lobbying
effort
is
a
house
bill
sponsored
by
rep
lamar
s
smith
rtex
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
it
would
cut
legal
immigration
by
30
percent
reduce
refugee
admissions
by
more
than
50
percent
and
crack
down
on
illegal
immigrants
through
a
variety
of
means
including
border
fences
and
more
border
patrol
agents
the
bill
also
calls
for
creation
of
a
computer
registry
to
verify
that
prospective
employees
are
legally
eligible
to
work
in
the
united
states
in
the
senate
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
is
introducing
a
bill
that
would
slash
legal
immigration
even
more
sharply
as
part
of
legislation
that
like
the
house
version
links
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
the
same
bill
in
addition
the
bipartisan
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
congresswoman
barbara
jordan
dtex
yesterday
released
a
report
that
offers
detailed
recommendations
for
cuts
in
legal
immigration
while
supporting
the
basic
framework
of
immigration
policy
although
the
proposed
cuts
in
admissions
of
highly
skilled
foreigners
would
affect
a
relatively
small
portion
of
annual
immigration
they
have
caught
the
attention
of
such
firms
as
microsoft
motorola
and
texas
instruments
which
were
among
nearly
60
hightech
firms
whose
executives
voiced
their
objections
on
capitol
hill
yesterday
up
to
now
the
most
outspoken
opposition
to
cuts
in
legal
immigration
has
come
from
hispanic
organizations
religious
groups
and
other
traditional
immigration
advocates
which
have
much
less
clout
than
the
business
community
with
the
republicancontrolled
congress
of
the
legal
immigration
limit
of
nearly
800000
for
fiscal
1995
skillsbased
admissions
are
set
at
140000
the
smith
bill
would
directly
and
indirectly
remove
more
than
32000
of
these
admissions
while
the
simpson
bill
would
cut
them
to
75000
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
recommends
a
level
of
100000
our
ability
to
get
the
best
talent
in
the
world
is
critical
to
us
said
kenneth
m
alvares
a
vice
president
of
sun
microsystems
a
fastgrowing
silicon
valley
computer
chip
company
restricting
that
ability
is
going
to
kill
us
he
said
we
will
not
be
able
to
compete
the
firm
which
employs
16000
people
has
been
unable
to
fill
more
than
1000
highly
technical
positions
and
feels
it
must
recruit
foreigners
if
cuts
in
skilled
admissions
are
enacted
alvares
said
his
company
might
be
forced
to
do
its
design
work
abroad
we
have
thousands
of
companies
that
care
about
this
said
phyllis
eisen
a
senior
policy
director
at
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
if
they
cant
get
the
people
they
want
they
will
move
overseas
such
immigration
cutbacks
thus
could
result
in
a
loss
of
jobs
in
the
united
states
said
charles
billingsley
a
spokesman
for
the
information
technology
association
of
america
i
dont
think
thats
what
the
legislators
have
in
mind
proponents
of
the
simpson
bill
argue
that
reducing
the
influx
of
immigrants
is
what
the
american
public
wants
in
order
to
address
the
need
for
engineers
and
scientists
say
congressional
sources
close
to
the
simpson
bill
the
legislation
would
require
employers
of
highly
skilled
immigrants
to
pay
a
fee
equal
to
30
percent
of
the
employees
firstyear
salary
into
a
fund
to
help
finance
training
for
americans
a
potentially
farreaching
provision
of
the
house
and
senate
bills
is
the
provision
for
a
centralized
computer
verification
system
which
employers
would
use
to
check
that
a
prospective
new
hire
was
legally
in
the
country
and
eligible
to
work
company
executives
expressed
concern
that
inaccurate
or
incomplete
responses
from
the
new
system
could
result
in
large
numbers
of
false
denials
of
employment
to
qualified
applicants
and
lead
to
costly
lawsuits
with
65
million
new
hires
a
year
in
the
united
states
an
error
rate
of
only
5
percent
would
cause
the
computer
to
wrongly
reject
more
than
3
million
people
and
tests
of
federal
data
bases
have
shown
error
rates
closer
to
30
percent

of
the
proposal
