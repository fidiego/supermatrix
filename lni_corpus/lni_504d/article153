the
obama
administration
is
moving
to
release
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
detained
at
facilities
across
the
country
if
the
immigrants
have
a
potential
path
to
legal
residency
the
move
could
affect
as
many
as
17000
immigrants
who
entered
the
country
illegally
or
overstayed
their
visas
according
to
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
officials
it
comes
amid
a
push
by
ice
to
focus
on
illegal
immigrants
who
have
committed
crimes
rather
than
seek
to
deport
all
illegal
immigrants
officials
say
that
the
shift
is
needed
to
reduce
massive
clogs
in
the
nations
immigration
courts
where
detainees
wait
for
months
or
years
before
their
cases
are
decided
and
to
use
deportation
as
a
tool
for
public
safety
ice
is
dedicating
unprecedented
resources
to
the
removal
of
criminal
aliens
said
richard
rocha
deputy
press
secretary
at
the
immigration
enforcement
agency
the
focus
now
is
clearly
on
criminal
aliens
we
want
to
ensure
convicted
criminal
aliens
are
not
only
removed
from
the
community
but
from
the
country
as
well
rocha
said
that
the
deportation
of
criminals
accounts
for
about
half
of
all
removals
an
alltime
high
if
the
immigrants
released
under
the
new
policy
have
their
applications
for
legalization
turned
down
ice
will
resume
removal
proceedings
while
immigration
advocates
applauded
the
move
and
said
it
reflected
a
more
humane
approach
to
illegal
immigrants
in
detention
republican
lawmakers
and
groups
that
favor
stricter
limits
on
immigration
denounced
it
as
a
form
of
backdoor
amnesty
the
number
of
immigrants
being
detained
in
the
united
states
has
doubled
in
the
last
decade
to
369000
annually
there
are
now
about
248000
cases
awaiting
review
in
backlogged
immigration
courts
according
to
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
at
syracuse
university
which
tracks
immigration
statistics
the
increases
have
triggered
huge
logistical
problems
and
exposed
successive
administrations
to
charges
that
those
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
a
violation
of
civil
statutes
are
being
exposed
to
unnecessarily
harsh
conditions
simultaneously
ice
officials
maintain
clogged
immigration
courts
divert
officials
from
identifying
tracking
down
and
deporting
illegal
immigrants
who
have
committed
violent
crimes
and
other
offenses
in
a
memo
dated
aug
20
ice
director
john
morton
wrote
that
as
many
as
17000
illegal
immigrants
have
pending
applications
for
legal
status

services
ices

within
the
department
of

security
as
those
applications
are
being
reviewed
immigrants
in
detention
who
do
not
have
criminal
backgrounds
might
be
eligible
for
release
morton
said
local
ice
officials
have
discretion
in
releasing
detainees
he
added
and
would
take
into
consideration
a
number
of
factors

national
security
and
public
safety
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
supports
tighter
controls
on
immigration
warned
that
the
move
would
demoralize
agents
working
for
ice
and
also
send
the
wrong
message
about
illegal
immigration
krikorian
acknowledged
that
the
government
has
to
set
immigration
enforcement
priorities
but
said
the
shortfall
in
resources
stems
partly
from
the
obama
administrations
not
seeking
sufficient
means
to
expedite
the
review
of
cases
and
the
deportation
of
detainees
simply
letting
them
go
sends
a
harmful
message
to
immigration
agents
and
to
illegal
immigrants
he
said
agents
feel
their
work
is
not
valued
the
message
sent
to
the
illegals
is
that
even
if
you
are
put
into
deportation
proceedings
we
will
