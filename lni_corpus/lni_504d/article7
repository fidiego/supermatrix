many
people
associate
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
with
states
that
border
mexico
such
as
texas
or
arizona
however
whether
it
is
in
the
united
states
senate
or
right
here
in
bergen
county
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
is
hotter
than
the
grand
canyon
and
just
as
much
of
a
difficult
hole
to
dig
out
of
last
year
bergen
county
republican
sheriff
candidate
harry
shortway
included
among
his
campaign
pledges
that
he
would
enter
into
an
agreement
with
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
to
authorize
county
officers
to
perform
immigration
law
enforcement
functions

just
this

several
activists
expressed
their
concern
to
governor
corzines
blue
ribbon
panel
on
immigration
policy
regarding
what
they
see
as
a
harsh
government
policy
to
seek
out
and
remove
illegal
immigrants
using
raids
in
new
jersey
and
the
detention
of
immigrants
in
county
jails
the
activists
do
not
see
the
immigrants
as
criminals
worthy
of
such
a
detention
us
attorney
christopher
christie
said
last
april
that
immigrants
are
not
committing
a
crime
by
entering
this
country
illegally
and
that
staying
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
civil
violation
but
there
are
also
those
who
are
not
as
sympathetic
to
the
undocumented
immigrants
living
in
north
jersey
currently
in
nearby
plainfield
the
immigration
reform
law
institute
the
legal
arm
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
is
representing
legal
residents
and
a
former
employee
in
a
lawsuit
against
connolly
properties
a
property
management
company
with
several
rental
complexes
in
northern
new
jersey
the
institute
alleges
that
connolly
properties
rents
to
illegal
immigrants
the
lawsuit
is
part
of
a
strategy
the
irli
is
attempting
in
various
parts
of
the
nation
hoping
illegal
immigrants
will
leave
the
country
by
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
find
employment
and
housing
in
the
united
states
i
think
our
strategy
has
been
working
said
garrett
roe
an
institute
staff
attorney
working
on
the
case
with
the
law
firm
of
deasey
mahoney
valentini
many
illegal
aliens
are
leaving
the
cities
and
states
where
antiillegal
immigration
laws
are
being
passed
obviously
the
ideal
situation
would
be
that
the
federal
government
enforce
the
law
so
on
the
one
hand
we
have
those
who
feel
that
the
government
is
cracking
down
too
hard
on
illegal
immigrants
treating
them
as
common
criminals
to
be
detained
at
jails
with
societys
worst
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
groups
like
the
irli
who
feel
that
the
government
is
failing
in
its
duty
to
enforce
illegal
immigration
laws
no
exit
therein
lies
the
difficulty
of
this
issue
it
truly
is
a
hole
from
which
no
possible
exit
will
make
both
sides
happy
and
there
is
also
the
notion
that
little
can
really
be
done
about
it
anyway
since
it
would
be
impossible
to
remove
the
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
already
living
in
this
country
many
of
them
if
they
start
enforcing
the
law
would
leave
on
their
own
concluded
roe
its
true
that
stronger
enforcement
of
the
illegal
immigration
laws
may
in
fact
reduce
illegal
immigration
but
at
what
cost
many
legal
residents
in
areas
such
as
north
jersey
have
strong
ties
to
their
undocumented
neighbors
furthermore
most
of
the
illegal
immigrants
are
otherwise
good
people
simply
looking
to
provide
for
their
family
if
the
cost
of
enforcing
the
immigration
law
includes
criminalizing
them
as
we
would
a
thief
or
a
violent
offender
then
that
cost
may
be
a
little
too
harsh
indeed
we
need
to
find
a
better
way
out
of
this
hole
