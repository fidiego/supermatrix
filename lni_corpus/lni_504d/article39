opponents
of
immigration
reform
are
once
again
speculating
about
the
death
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
this
year
and
at
first
glance
the
house
of
representatives
calendar
is
too
full
with
other
issues
chiefly
now
the
budget
battle
and
government
shutdown
as
well
as
the
looming
debt
ceiling
fight
while
congress
certainly
has
other
important
issues
to
consider
this
year
the
notion
that
the
house
cannot
advance
immigration
legislation
because
of
lack
of
votes
or
lack
of
time
is
flawed
in
fact
comprehensive
immigration
reform
has
been
gaining
momentum
among
republicans
who
are
listening
to
their
constituents
demands
and
tackling
immigration
reform
with
practical
common
ground
solutions
has
the
potential
to
improve
americas
long
and
shortterm
fiscal
health
as
well
on october
5th
supporters
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
will
rally
in
more
than
100
cities
and
the
capitol
to
demand
speedy
action
house
republicans
would
be
wise
to
listen
to
what
overwhelming
majorities
of
us
citizens
as
well
as
small
businesses
faith
communities
and
the
technology
and
agricultural
sectors
are
clamoring
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
in
2013
house
democrats
released
their
own
version
of
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
yesterday
to
remind
their
gop
colleagues
of
this
issues
urgency
but
they
need
republican
support
to
make
real
progress
meanwhile
house
republicans
are
reportedly
working
on
a
series
of
smallerscale
proposals
after
their
party
leadership
refused
to
vote
on
the
comprehensive
immigration
bill
that
the
senate
passed
with
strong
bipartisan
support
earlier
this
year
the
senate
legislation
included
the
provision
for
an
earned
path
to
citizenship
for
eleven
million
undocumented
immigrants
contingent
on
a
heavy
immigration
enforcement
buildup
the
spring
immigration
debate
in
the
senate
that
led
to
this
bipartisan
bill
was
largely
the
result
of
legislators
wakeup
call
from
the
2012
elections
when
latino
and
immigrant
voters
overwhelmingly
supported
democrats
and
helped
deliver
president
obamas
reelection
the
momentum
remains
on
the
side
of
latinos
immigrants
and
other
supporters
of
reform
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
favor
comprehensive
immigration
reform
rather
than
piecemeal
changes
or
those
that
focus
on
enforcementonly
approaches
or
work
visas
for
particular
industries
over
the
summer
advocates
of
reform organized
approximately
1200
events
including
vigils
and
protests
in
more
than
40
states
attended
nearly
150
town
halls
conducted
more
than
350
congressional
visits
collected
600000
signatures
for
a
petition
for
house
speaker
john
boehner
and
contacted
members
of
congress
nearly
100000
times
according
to
the
alliance
for
citizenships
database now
on
oct
5
supporters
will
again
rally
nationwide
to
demand
comprehensive
immigration
reform
these
grassroots
efforts
have
paid
off
despite
many
republicans
concern
about
alienating
their
base
by
supporting
comprehensive
immigration
reform
at
least
26
house
republicans have
publicly
supported
a
path
to
citizenship
including
new
yorks
rep
peter
king
mr
king
saw
that
80
percent
of
his
long
island
constituents
support
reform
including
70
percent
of
republicans
a
figure
that
echoes
national
survey
results
he
heard
the
myriad
phone
calls
to
his
office
listened
to
voters
at
the
dozens
of
public
events
they
organized
and
opted
to
take
a
clear
public
stance
republicans
like
king
who
have
earned
our
praise
have
recognized
what
became
abundantly
clear
in
november
2012
and
what
remains
so
today
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
one
of
those
rare
marriages
of
good
policy
and
good
politics
it
should
constitute
common
ground
for
republicans
and
democrats
as
many
senators
have
already
shown
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
good
policy
because
it
offers
a
commonsense
solution
to
our
broken
immigration
system
by
offering
an
earned
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
immigrants
while
updating
our
visa
system
and
border
security
system
while
many
proimmigrant
groups
like
ours
feel
the
senate
bill
went
too
far
in
further
militarizing
our
borders
we
accepted
that
politics
is
the
art
of
the
possible
and
compromise
was
necessary
we
hope
and
expect
that
those
with
views
different
from
ours
will
recognize
the
same
we
further
know
what
myriad
studies
have
shown
comprehensive
immigration
reform
would
not
only
keep
millions
of
families
together
but
also
reinvigorate
our
economy
and
help
strengthen
national
priorities
like
social
security
such
reform
is
ultimately
good
politics
for
republicans
because
without
it
the
antiimmigrant
albatross
will
remain
firmly
fixed
around
their
necks
failure
by
the
gopcontrolled
house
to
pass
a
comprehensive
bill
would
reaffirm
what
most
latino
and
immigrant
voters
were
thinking
when
they
voted
for
democrats
last
november
the
gop
does
not
take
their
needs
seriously and
the
latino
and
immigrant
electorate
will
only
continue
to
grow
but
opponents
of
reform
continue
to
stall
presenting
the
likely
fall
house
calendar
in
september
for
his
republican
colleagues
house
majority
leader
eric
cantor
prioritized
other
issues
before
immigration
reform
saying
only
that the
house
may
begin
considering some
immigration
reform
legislation
given
the
other
items
on
the
calendar rep
bob
goodlatte
r
of
virginia
who
chairs
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
said
his
committee
will
take
up
various
pieces
of
immigrationrelated
legislation
in
october
but
without
including
a
path
to
citizenship
for
eleven
million
undocumented
immigrants
and
without
providing
a
clear
timeline
for
action
this
is
simply
not
good
enough
the
notion
that
lawkmakers
cannot
debate
issues
like
the
federal
budget
while
advancing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
legislation
is
an
insult
to
our
congress
and
an
insult
to
voters
and
the
notion
that
immigration
reform
should
take
a
back
seat
to
a
manufactured
debtceiling
crisis
is
even
more
preposterous
its
time
for
the
house
of
representatives
to
follow
the
will
of
the
american
people
and
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform

fall
