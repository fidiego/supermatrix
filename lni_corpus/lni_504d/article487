javier
loera
who
can
neither
hear
nor
speak
was
held
by
federal
immigration
authorities
in
maximum
security
at
the
regions
detention
centre
for
more
than
two
months
before
his
release
friday
his
is
a
tale
of
a
system
that
presumes
guilt
first
and
easily
denies
freedom
loera
crossed
from
the
united
states
into
saskatchewan
by
bicycle
last
year
then
sought
out
immigration
officials
in
regina
there
he
was
detained
for
a
deportation
inquiry
he
was
ordered
deported
even
though
he
had
no
lawyer
and
no
one
knew
his
native
country
he
was
freed
and
told
to
stay
in
regina
until
his
removal
loera
in
his
early
30s
did
not
sign
any
documents
agreeing
to
the
conditions
of
his
release
its
not
clear
if
he
even
understood
them
because
he
got
back
on
his
bicycle
he
rode
across
the
country
and
into
ontario
stopping
at
provincial
police
stations
for
a
free
meal
and
a
night
in
the
cell
blocks
when
he
reached
ottawa
in
october
he
went
to
city
police
who
unsure
of
his
identity
or
origins
contacted
immigration
canada
since
then
loera
has
been
in
jail
and
has
faced
at
least
three
detention
review
hearings
without
legal
counsel
on
his
first
review
a
deaf
inmate
at
the
centre
acted
as
his
interpreter
it
wasnt
until
a
qualified
interpreter
was
eventually
called
that
ottawa
lawyer
riad
tallim
heard
about
the
case
he
met
loera
for
the
first
time
at
ottawacarletons
regional
detention
centre
dec
5
he
was
devastated
he
was
such
a
broken
man
he
was
slouched
over
shoulders
concave
you
could
see
it
on
his
face
says
tallim
who
said
immigration
officials
had
made
no
effort
to
get
loera
legal
help
after
a
threehour
detention
review
dec
21
loeras
first
with
a
lawyer
present
ottawa
immigration
adjudicator
gr
mcbrien
ordered
him
freed
it
had
become
clear
that
loera
believed
to
be
from
chile
had
been
trying
all
along
to
get
home
he
had
been
peddling
like
mad
to
find
the
coast
hoping
to
catch
a
boat
for
south
america
local
immigration
officials
hadnt
bought
his
story
tallim
is
convinced
that
if
he
had
not
heard
about
the
case
which
he
handled
free
of
charge
loeras
detention
would
have
continued
indefinitely
in
fact
although
loera
was
ordered
freed
dec
23
he
remained
in
jail
until
jan
6
tallim
was
told
immigration
was
shortstaffed
over
the
christmas
holidays
and
had
no
one
to
sign
loera
out
were
talking
about
someones
freedom
says
tallim
but
immigration
is
an
entity
unto
itself
they
have
onerous
powers
and
they
can
wield
those
with
seemingly
no
responsibility
if
immigration
canadas
system
of
justice
can
disregard
the
rights
of
someone
like
loera
it
raises
questions
about
the
justice
meted
out
to
other
immigrants
those
with
criminal
convictions
in
their
past
who
have
recently
been
subject
to
an
unprecedented
immigration
crackdown
critics
say
that
by
enforcing
a
section
of
the
immigration
act
it
had
previously
let
lapse
the
federal
government
is
trampling
some
fundamental
civil
rights
under
immigrations
toughened
policy
many
people
face
frequent
lengthy
incarcerations
even
if
they
have
no
current
criminal
charges
or
recent
convictions
they
often
face
deportation
hearings
without
legal
representation
and
without
family
or
friends
present
the
immigration
and
refugee
board
has
scheduled
these
hearings
to
be
held
in
facilities
which
are
closed
to
the
public
although
the
act
says
they
must
be
open
lawyers
say
its
one
thing
to
deport
immigrants
with
past
convictions
some
of
whom
have
long
records
of
serious
crimes
but
quite
another
to
sacrifice
justice
in
the
process
some
senior
police
officials
who
would
be
happy
to
see
criminals
forced
to
leave
the
country
question
whether
the
current
process
is
fair
and
wonder
if
canada
is
being
responsible
by
deporting
people
who
may
have
spent
most
of
their
lives
in
this
country
and
one
diplomatic
mission
has
criticized
the
immigration
departments
methods
as
bordering
on
human
rights
abuses
the
number
of
people
being
jailed
has
also
risen
sharply
according
to
immigrations
central
detention
and
removals
office
in
ontario
1223
people
were
being
held
in
this
province
between
april
and
november
1994
a
20percent
increase
over
the
same
period
the
year
before
and
these
people
are
being
locked
up
at
immigrations
request
for
periods
of
time
that
are
averaging
50percent
longer
than
they
did
in
1993
doug
kellam
assistant
manager
of
detentions
and
removals
says
the
increases
reflect
immigrations
concentrated
efforts
to
deport
from
the
country
noncitizens
with
criminal
records
since
the
toronto
shootings
of
a
police
officer
and
of
a
young
woman
in
the
just
desserts
cafe
last
spring
the
federal
immigration
department
has
cracked
down
arresting
detaining
and
deporting
immigrants
with
criminal
pasts
both
const
todd
baylis
and
georgina
leimonis
were
shot
by
suspects
who
had
been
ordered
deported
but
had
not
been
removed
in
response
citizenship
and
immigration
minister
sergio
marchi
established
a
joint
immigrationrcmp
task
force
in
toronto
montreal
and
vancouver
to
round
up
and
remove
1888
people
with
criminal
convictions
who
remained
in
canada
despite
being
ordered
deported
but
the
crackdown
has
actually
cast
a
wider
net
to
include
people
who
have
past
criminal
records
but
no
outstanding
removal
orders
our
objective
here
is
to
deport
people
says
leonard
jodoin
director
of
national
enforcement
for
immigration
canada
thats
really
what
we
do
here
a
policy
memorandum
issued
by
immigration
headquarters
in
ottawa
this
summer
also
directed
staff
to
argue
at
immigration
hearings
to
keep
people
detained
rather
than
have
them
released
on
certain
conditions
as
well
local
offices
can
now
order
deportation
inquiries
a
decision
traditionally
made
by
regional
supervisors
police
say
this
has
led
to
a
very
very
different
response
on
the
part
of
federal
immigration
authorities
to
the
problem
of
immigrants
who
have
committed
crimes
in
the
past
we
had
our
problems
with
people
committing
crimes
says
supt
brian
skinner
head
of
ottawas
criminal
investigations
they
were
people
whose
resident
status
in
canada
was
at
least
questionable
and
for
a
long
time
our
perception
had
been
that
this
wasnt
a
situation
immigration
was
taking
very
seriously
that
has
changed
and
theres
no
disputing
that
many
of
those
now
facing
deportation
are
hardcore
cases
theyve
raped
robbed
moved
guns
and
sold
drugs
among
them
are
some
of
ottawas
most
notorious
criminals
locksley
francis
29
who
came
to
canada
at
age
seven
and
has
a
lengthy
criminal
record
for
assaults
and
prostitutionrelated
offences
faces
deportation
to
jamaica
for
a
1989
conviction
christopher
richard
and
simeon
dillon
three
brothers
who
have
been
in
canada
for
more
than
a
decade
also
face
deportation
to
jamaica
for
similar
records
in
a
few
months
of
detentions
and
hearings
immigration
is
accomplishing
what
the
courts
could
not
offering
a
permanent
solution
by
kicking
such
people
out
of
the
country
police
hope
immigrations
tough
stance
will
take
up
the
slack
of
lenient
court
sentences
says
david
olson
assistant
manager
of
ottawas
immigration
centre
theyre
saying
if
we
send
him
a
criminal
to
the
kingston
pen
for
five
years
hell
be
back
on
the
streets
but
hey
i
can
get
rid
of
him
for
good
if
i
call
immigration
but
even
local
police
who
admit
being
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
getting
rid
of
such
troublemakers
question
the
fairness
of
the
process
if
a
young
person
comes
to
canada
is
educated
in
canada
grows
up
in
canada
and
whether
or
not
they
ever
take
out
citizenship
and
then
later
in
life
becomes
a
criminal
i
think
its
stupid
to
adopt
the
position
that
theyve
got
to
be
deported
back
to
the
country
they
left
when
they
were
an
infant
says
skinner
ottawacarleton
police
chief
brian
ford
is
concerned
immigration
authorities
compensating
for
an
inadequate
response
in
the
past
may
now
be
going
overboard
because
fair
is
fair
on
human
rights
you
have
to
have
open
fair
hearings
says
ford
when
you
close
the
doors
you
are
open
to
abuses
the
broad
parameters
of
the
immigration
act
have
allowed
the
department
to
scoop
up
people
who
may
not
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
years
were
getting
into
a
dangerous
area
where
there
starts
to
be
a
visceral
reaction
to
deporting
individuals
who
may
have
been
rehabilitated
or
may
not
have
committed
serious
crimes
at
all
says
ottawa
lawyer
jonathan
chaplan
some
of
the
convictions
immigration
is
using
to
bring
people
before
deportation
proceedings
date
back
10
years
says
ottawa
lawyer
rene
st
fort
under
the
immigration
act
a
noncitizen
can
be
deported
if
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
for
which
he
served
six
months
or
for
which
a
sentence
of
five
years
or
more
could
have
been
imposed
the
lawyer
prosecuting
the
case
on
behalf
of
immigration
wins
an
order
to
deport
simply
by
proving
the
permanent
resident
is
not
a
citizen
and
that
he
or
she
has
the
kind
of
criminal
conviction
the
act
describes
the
hearings
under
this
section
are
considered
so
partial
that
legal
aid
by
policy
will
not
provide
counsel
legal
aid
normally
provides
counsel
to
anyone
who
cant
afford
a
lawyer
theres
nothing
a
lawyer
can
do
explains
keith
wilkins
legal
aids
area
director
because
the
legislation
leaves
the
adjudicator
no
choice
ive
got
to
say
it
appears
to
work
like
a
conveyor
belt
with
little
discretion
conveying
a
person
out
the
door
out
of
the
country
without
the
procedural
or
humanitarian
niceties
legal
aid
therefore
does
not
cover
deportation
inquiries
and
will
cover
only
one
detention
review
such
reviews
are
to
be
held
within
the
first
48
hours
of
incarceration
then
within
seven
days
then
every
30
days
afterwards
the
act
gives
immigration
canada
many
powers
investigating
arresting
and
detaining
the
immigration
and
refugee
board
a
body
independent
of
the
department
decides
who
is
detained
and
deported
and
conducts
appeals
neither
of
these
bodies
is
obliged
to
provide
lawyers
to
people
facing
hearings
although
they
have
the
discretion
to
do
so
the
gap
that
leaves
some
detainees
without
legal
help
stuns
skinner
it
flies
in
the
face
of
almost
every
element
of
the
canadian
judicial
system
he
says
its
a
denial
of
fundamental
rights
the
charter
guarantees
everyone
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
charter
of
rights
and
freedoms
applies
to
everyone
in
the
country
citizen
or
not
the
immigration
and
refugee
board
in
apparent
contravention
of
its
own
act
conducts
deportation
hearings
privately
in
detention
centres
lawyer
tallim
says
this
points
to
the
systems
presumption
of
guilt
where
immigrants
face
hearings
behind
barred
doors
dressed
in
prison
coveralls
looking
like
criminals
and
alone
when
in
fact
their
families
are
often
outside
waiting
in
the
lobby
of
the
jail
and
the
board
is
holding
more
people
in
jail
than
ever
before
supt
david
gorman
in
charge
of
ottawacarletons
detention
centre
says
he
was
told
by
immigration
officials
at
a
conference
in
november
to
expect
an
increase
in
immigrationrelated
detentions
because
of
the
toronto
shootings
one
month
later
touring
through
the
innes
road
facility
he
discovered
these
detentions
had
jumped
to
32
from
20
at
this
time
last
year
immigration
board
requests
to
hold
hearings
at
the
detention
centre
now
arrive
weekly
quite
often
we
dont
receive
a
great
deal
of
information
on
these
cases
to
find
out
where
these
people
might
more
appropriately
be
held
says
gorman
he
is
reviewing
why
immigration
detainees
are
kept
in
maximum
security
at
torontos
metro
west
detention
centre
the
primary
facility
for
immigration
detainees
in
ontario
the
number
of
inmates
held
on
immigration
warrants
most
with
no
criminal
charges
against
them
has
jumped
since
the
summer
to
a
daily
average
of
between
90
and
100
compared
with
a
daily
average
of
40
in
the
months
before
the
shootings
the
detentions
have
contributed
to
overcrowding
in
the
jail
says
deputy
supt
connie
mahaffy
many
toronto
immigration
detainees
have
had
to
be
bused
to
ottawacarleton
and
while
most
inmates
on
criminal
charges
remain
at
the
centre
for
an
average
of
20
days
mahaffy
says
those
held
through
immigration
remain
incarcerated
an
average
of
90
days
gorman
says
such
people
also
spend
two
to
three
times
longer
in
jail
than
other
inmates
kellam
says
the
average
time
spent
in
jail
of
an
immigration
detainee
in
199394
was
26
days
for
199495
the
average
so
far
is
about
40
days
our
length
of
detentions
is
50percent
higher
than
it
was
one
year
ago
kellam
says
and
we
are
concerned
about
that
the
higher
numbers
of
detainees
have
increased
pressure
on
immigration
creating
a
vicious
circle
kellam
describes
how
adjudicators
have
been
forced
to
spend
so
much
time
reviewing
peoples
detentions
that
actual
hearings
are
being
delayed
extending
the
amount
of
time
people
are
spending
in
jail
kellam
says
the
department
is
examining
all
cases
in
a
onemonth
period
to
see
who
is
being
held
why
and
what
can
be
done
to
avoid
delays
immigration
adjudicators
and
criminal
court
judges
are
to
detain
people
if
they
are
deemed
to
be
a
threat
to
the
public
or
if
there
is
fear
they
will
not
appear
for
their
next
hearing
but
ottawa
lawyer
chaplan
says
he
regularly
sees
cases
where
a
judge
has
deemed
a
person
fit
to
release
on
bail
only
to
be
told
by
an
immigration
adjudicator
that
the
person
is
to
be
detained
but
if
these
people
arent
a
danger
to
the
public
then
its
costing
us
a
lot
of
money
to
house
them
he
says
in
ontario
it
costs
about
128
a
day
to
house
an
inmate
with
a
current
high
of
90
inmates
a
day
at
the
metro
west
detention
centre
held
through
immigration
each
spending
an
average
of
90
days
in
jail
the
bill
to
taxpayers
is
1036800
immigration
spent
about
4
million
keeping
people
jailed
in
ontario
in
199394
in
the
first
eight
months
of
this
fiscal
year
immigrations
provincial
budget
was
already
spent
kellam
predicts
it
will
cost
more
than
7
million
before
the
fiscal
year
ends
in
march
in
one
case
ottawa
lawyer
st
fort
says
he
offered
some
425000
in
collateral
to
have
a
person
released
but
the
adjudicator
declined
he
said
he
wasnt
sure
what
would
be
a
fair
figure
says
st
fort
who
is
appealing
the
decision
to
a
federal
court
adjudicators
may
be
detaining
people
because
of
the
recent
intense
public
scrutiny
they
have
to
think
can
i
live
with
this
if
this
person
gets
out
and
does
harm
says
judy
paulsen
manager
at
ottawas
immigration
centre
but
tallim
says
immigration
adjudicators
must
rise
above
those
concerns
if
people
are
influenced
by
public
opinion
how
can
they
be
considered
unbiased
jodoin
of
immigration
enforcement
makes
no
apologies
for
the
stricter
test
adjudicators
apply
because
the
punishment
imposed
by
criminal
courts
can
be
trivial
compared
to
deportation
which
is
in
effect
a
life
sentence
if
you
go
to
a
court
to
a
judge
and
you
get
a
conviction
of
two
years
then
youre
back
out
on
the
street
what
have
you
been
deprived
of
jodoin
says
officials
at
the
jamaican
high
commission
are
angry
about
the
lengthy
detentions
of
some
awaiting
deportation
acting
deputy
high
commissioner
andrea
crutchley
says
she
is
concerned
by
the
cases
of
people
held
in
maximum
security
who
have
no
recent
criminal
convictions
or
current
criminal
charges
weve
called
immigration
officers
to
talk
to
them
about
people
being
treated
unfairly
to
try
to
appeal
to
them
on
certain
humanitarian
grounds
in
certain
cases
she
says
sometimes
these
people
are
not
being
given
a
fair
chance
they
are
being
treated
like
they
are
not
humans
lawyers
accustomed
to
criminal
court
standards
are
appalled
that
since
only
two
adjudicators
cover
eastern
ontario
decisions
on
detentions
are
usually
reviewed
by
the
same
adjudicator
who
made
the
original
ruling
the
most
important
decisions
are
those
regarding
a
persons
liberty
says
ottawa
lawyer
lawrence
greenspon
in
the
courts
you
would
never
go
before
the
same
judge
on
a
detention
review
who
ordered
you
detained
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
an
appearance
of
bias
you
cant
have
that
in
the
criminal
courts
and
you
shouldnt
have
it
in
the
immigration
system
immigration
board
communications
director
david
austin
says
theres
little
thats
likely
to
change
between
one
detention
review
and
the
next
so
theres
no
problem
in
the
existing
circumstances
in
the
small
chapel
at
the
innes
road
detention
centre
where
immigration
hearings
are
held
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply
hearsay
is
admissable
and
criminal
court
acquittals
are
suspect
here
anything
goes
says
lawyer
st
fort
ive
heard
police
giving
testimony
saying
that
well
word
on
the
street
is
to
support
their
evidence
i
say
i
didnt
hear
that
and
he
says
looks
to
me
like
were
not
on
the
same
street
this
should
not
be
admissable
transcripts
of
immigration
hearings
obtained
by
the
citizen
show
examples
of
this
sort
of
hearsay
in
a
detention
review
hearing
against
the
dillon
brothers
an
rcmp
officer
testified
the
family
was
actually
an
organized
crime
group
dealing
in
crackcocaine
and
prostitution
he
had
no
evidence
of
the
allegations
but
said
he
was
using
information
he
had
gathered
through
informants
i
am
gathering
information
from
source
informants
that
they
are
involved
in
the
dealing
of
drugs
i
am
not
here
to
prove
that
they
are
i
am
just
here
to
say
i
am
gathering
information
from
different
sources
he
told
the
hearing
police
agree
immigration
hearings
accept
and
give
weight
to
evidence
that
criminal
courts
discount
but
its
a
practice
they
say
is
worthwhile
for
too
long
these
proceedings
had
only
input
from
the
other
side
police
say
now
local
police
and
rcmp
note
a
growing
trend
on
the
part
of
immigration
to
have
them
testify
at
these
hearings
the
lawyer
who
prosecutes
the
case
for
immigration
reads
statements
of
police
summaries
as
fact
and
lawyers
argue
they
have
no
way
of
finding
out
the
basis
of
allegations
chaplan
says
prosecuting
lawyers
cannot
be
crossexamined
yet
adjudicators
unlike
judges
give
their
information
significant
weight
the
transcripts
show
that
adjudicators
do
not
view
their
quasijudicial
system
as
being
anything
like
the
criminal
courts
in
the
detention
review
of
the
dillon
brothers
in
november
lawyer
st
fort
objected
to
immigrations
lawyer
giving
details
of
an
alleged
crime
in
which
there
was
no
conviction
adjudicator
annamaria
micillo
said
of
course
convictions
puts
much
heavier
weight
on
someone
a
criminal
activity
but
as
i
said
before
it
doesnt
mean
because
a
person
has
not
been
convicted
that
the
person
didnt
do
the
offence
we
have
heard
from
a
police
officer
who
had
experience
in
the
court
witnesses
are
dropping
charges
because
they
are
scared
or
they
dont
want
to
bother
to
go
to
court
or
anything
but
witnesses
also
drop
cases
because
theyve
lied
tallim
argues
and
this
view
disregards
that
possibility
this
is
not
some
flybynight
hearing
this
is
a
quasijudicial
process
about
freedom
and
shes
saying
she
doesnt
care
if
a
judge
acquitted
him
shes
saying
i
know
better
but
immigration
lawyer
mike
bell
who
has
one
of
the
busiest
practices
in
the
city
says
theres
no
intrinsic
evil
in
immigrations
tougher
attitude
complaints
about
the
process
bell
says
may
come
from
fainthearted
liberals
who
have
to
remember
immigration
has
been
lied
to
there
are
people
who
have
thrown
every
trick
in
the
book
to
get
here
and
then
cry
foul
when
it
tries
to
remove
them
but
critics
ask
what
rules
of
fairness
are
being
sacrificed
for
expediency
theres
an
antiimmigrant
sentiment
out
there
and
some
of
these
guys
are
not
the
most
appealing
guys
in
the
world
but
they
have
rights
and
they
are
just
being
trampled
upon
says
tallim
they
are
being
abused
