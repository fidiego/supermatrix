the
house
voted
overwhelmingly
today
to
abolish
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
divide
its
functions
between
two
new
bureaus
one
for
immigration
services
like
the
handling
of
citizenship
applications
the
other
for
enforcement
the
lopsided
vote
405
to
9
reflected
lawmakers
frustration
over
the
agencys
missteps
before
and
after
sept
11
indeed
the
bills
sponsors
said
its
provisions
were
only
the
beginning
of
a
long
process
to
overhaul
the
way
the
nation
protects
its
borders
enforces
its
immigration
laws
and
provides
services
to
millions
of
immigrants
the
two
bureaus
that
the
bill
calls
for
would
report
to
a
new
associate
attorney
general
for
immigration
affairs
at
the
justice
department
the
immigration
services
parent
the
role
of
that
new
official
appears
certain
to
be
a
contentious
issue
as
critics
noted
today
the
bill
would
give
the
official
broad
authority
over
immigration
policy
but
no
direct
budgetary
or
personnel
authority
the
house
vote
followed
four
hours
of
floor
remarks
in
which
legislators
voiced
pentup
frustration
with
an
agency
notorious
for
long
delays
surly
service
and
antiquated
computers
while
always
exasperating
the
bungling
suddenly
constituted
a
national
security
threat
after
sept
11
many
lawmakers
said
this
bill
is
not
a
panacea
said
the
house
judiciary
chairman
representative
f
james
sensenbrenner
jr
republican
of
wisconsin
whose
committee
drafted
the
legislation
it
will
take
a
long
time
for
us
to
put
our
immigration
affairs
back
in
order
but
this
is
an
essential
first
step
a
parallel
senate
bill
sponsored
by
senators
edward
m
kennedy
democrat
of
massachusetts
and
sam
brownback
republican
of
kansas
is
expected
to
be
introduced
next
week
the
senate
judiciary
committee
is
to
hold
a
hearing
on
it
next
thursday
sensing
that
the
momentum
for
a
legislative
solution
to
the
immigration
services
woes
had
overtaken
the
agencys
own
fixit
effort
the
white
house
unexpectedly
abandoned
its
official
neutrality
and
private
opposition
to
the
house
bill
late
wednesday
and
endorsed
it
today
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
said
the
administration
still
objected
to
some
of
the
bills
details
mainly
the
new
associate
attorney
generals
relative
lack
of
authority
but
mr
ashcroft
said
the
measures
broad
outlines
to
create
greater
effectiveness
and
efficiency
in
immigration
matters
closely
tracked
the
goals
that
george
w
bush
promised
while
campaigning
two
years
ago
and
later
as
president
it
is
time
to
separate
fully
our
services
to
legal
immigrants
who
helped
build
america
from
our
enforcement
against
illegal
aliens
who
violate
the
law
mr
ashcroft
told
reporters
on
capitol
hill
before
the
vote
the
idea
of
reorganizing
the
immigration
service
one
of
the
governments
fastestgrowing
agencies
with
37000
employees
and
a
62
billion
annual
budget
has
been
a
legislative
perennial
since
the
late
1970s
the
agency
has
staggering
paperwork
backlogs
and
sharply
differing
mandates
it
is
responsible
for
policing
thousands
of
miles
of
border
with
canada
and
mexico
and
for
immigration
enforcement
within
the
country
while
also
charged
with
providing
benefits
to
millions
of
the
nations
newest
residents
but
efforts
to
restructure
the
agency
have
always
failed
a
victim
of
inertia
or
lack
of
consensus
the
attacks
on
sept
11
and
the
focus
on
security
afterward
changed
all
that
the
19
hijackers
on
sept
11
were
all
foreignborn
men
living
in
the
united
states
on
temporary
visas
and
at
least
two
were
in
violation
of
their
visa
conditions
then
in
march
an
immigration
service
contractor
sent
visa
extensions
for
mohamed
atta
and
marwan
alshehhi
two
of
the
dead
hijackers
to
the
florida
flight
school
where
they
had
received
instruction
that
was
the
last
straw
even
for
the
agencys
remaining
backers
on
capitol
hill
we
saw
in
the
911
incident
some
of
the
problems
in
the
ins
that
many
of
us
had
seen
before
representative
richard
a
gephardt
of
missouri
the
house
democratic
leader
said
before
the
vote
today
it
became
clear
i
think
to
everybody
in
the
country
and
in
the
congress
that
we
needed
reform
in
a
rare
display
of
bipartisanship
republicans
and
democrats
on
the
judiciary
committee
one
of
the
most
polarized
in
congress
reached
compromise
on
a
bill
earlier
this
month
the
bill
would
create
a
bureau
of
immigration
services
and
adjudications
responsible
for
handling
matters
like
visa
petitions
and
citizenship
and
asylum
applications
and
a
bureau
of
immigration
enforcement
which
would
oversee
the
border
patrol
immigrant
detention
centers
and
immigration
inspectors
of
the
few
lawmakers
who
voted
against
the
measure
today
several
said
the
changes
did
not
go
far
enough
for
instance
the
administering
of
immigration
benefits
would
continue
to
be
split
among
the
justice
labor
and
state
departments
as
under
current
law
unfortunately
the
bill
brought
to
us
today
simply
rearranges
the
boxes
on
the
existing
organization
chart
of
the
ins
said
representative
jim
kolbe
republican
of
arizona
while
immigration
advocates
and
other
specialists
said
the
legislation
was
an
important
first
step
they
voiced
concern
that
the
house
bill
would
not
adequately
coordinate
those
service
and
enforcement
functions
that
are
inextricably
linked
immigration
inspectors
at
airports
for
instance
are
the
first
line
of
defense
against
terrorists
but
they
are
also
the
first
officials
encountered
by
a
foreigner
seeking
asylum
in
addition
the
administration
and
senate
democrats
complained
that
the
new
associate
attorney
general
would
have
less
authority
than
the
current
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
there
are
significant
problems
with
the
house
bill
senator
kennedy
said
in
a
statement
today
and
i
am
concerned
that
it
does
not
provide
the
necessary
leadership
and
authority
to
make
immigration
reform
a
reality
it
is
also
unclear
how
the
reorganization
envisioned
by
the
bill
fits
into
a
proposal
under
consideration
by
mr
bush
to
create
a
new
border
security
agency
another
step
that
would
require
congressional
approval
under
that
plan
proposed
by
tom
ridge
the
director
of
homeland
security
the
border
patrol
which
is
now
a
part
of
the
immigration
service
would
be
merged
with
the
customs
service
now
a
part
of
the
treasury
department
and
the
new
combined
agency
would
fall
under
the
justice
department
mr
ashcroft
said
today
that
the
immigration
service
would
continue
its
administrative
overhaul
until
congress
pushed
through
its
own
plan
immigration
advocates
generally
supportive
of
the
legislative
effort
said
they
would
be
watching
carefully
as
it
evolved
we
need
an
agency
restructured
to
meet
the
goals
of
a
safer
country
but
also
one
that
welcomes
immigrants
said
angela
kelley
a
deputy
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
thats
got
to
be
the
overarching
goal
