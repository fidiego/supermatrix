attend
a
spirited
but
civil
debate
at
brown
university
providence
it
is
one
of
the
most
contentious
debates
in
us
society
what
level
of
immigration
should
the
government
allow
that
axiom
was
proved
again
last
night
at
a
session
of
the
providence
journalbrown
university
public
affairs
conference
that
focused
on
how
the
country
can
best
balance
nationalsecurity
concerns
with
humane
immigration
policies
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
seeks
to
limit
immigration
to
the
united
states
and
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
which
supports
making
it
easier
for
undocumented
immigrants
to
become
legal
citizens
squared
off
before
an
audience
of
about
150
at
browns
salomon
center
in
a
spirited
but
civil
debate
krikorian
argued
that
the
united
states
must
limit
immigration
and
crack
down
on
those
in
the
country
illegally
and
the
businesses
that
hire
them
current
levels
of
illegal
immigration
threaten
national
security
by
allowing
terrorists
access
to
the
country
and
hurt
bluecollar
workers
by
depressing
wages
the
most
important
weapons
are
not
the
suitcase
bombs
or
anthrax
spores
said
krikorian
its
the
terrorists
themselves
immigration
policy
is
going
to
be
job
one
in
preventing
terrorism
said
krikorian
but
sharry
countered
that
policies
that
clamp
down
on
immigration
using
the
cloak
of
national
security
are
unreasonable
and
will
do
more
to
punish
people
pursuing
legitimate
business
and
cultural
trade
than
stop
terrorists
improved
intelligence
not
the
presence
of
more
border
police
sharry
said
is
the
best
way
to
stop
such
terrorists
as
the
alqaida
operatives
who
executed
the
sept
11
2001
terrorist
attacks
in
new
york
and
washington
if
you
dont
know
who
the
bad
guys
are
how
are
you
going
to
keep
them
out
said
sharry
krikorian
argued
that
the
us
government
isnt
serious
about
limiting
immigration
the
government
bureaucracy
for
procesing
immigrants
is
understaffed
and
clogged
with
a
huge
backlog
weve
done
nothing
to
enforce
immigration
laws
in
the
last
decade
except
increase
border
patrols
in
2003
krikorian
said
only
15
companies
across
the
united
states
were
cited
for
hiring
undocumented
aliens
there
is
no
effort
to
turn
off
the
magnet
of
jobs
but
sharry
said
the
government
has
tried
beefing
up
border
patrols
to
no
avail
so
long
as
the
united
states
has
jobs
and
immigrant
communities
sharry
argued
that
help
and
shelter
newcomers
immigrants
will
flow
across
the
countrys
borders
as
has
been
the
case
for
all
of
the
nations
history
i
dont
think
risking
your
life
to
come
to
the
united
states
to
work
should
be
a
crime
for
which
you
should
spend
time
in
jail
said
sharry
government
policies
should
reward
those
who
work
and
obey
the
law
by
allowing
them
to
live
here
legally
and
launching
them
on
a
track
to
become
full
citizens
sharry
said
krikorian
said
legal
immigration
to
the
united
states
currently
about
11
million
people
a
year
is
too
high
and
ought
to
be
cut
to
350000
or
so
high
levels
of
immigration
benefit
the
owners
of
capital
but
hurt
most
workers
by
pushing
down
wage
levels
immigration
policy
krikorian
said
is
an
issue
where
public
opinon
surveys
show
that
there
is
a
wide
divergence
in
the
views
of
the
business
academic
and
government
elite
who
favor
relaxed
immigration
laws
and
average
americans
who
do
not
the
people
who
are
hurt
by
immigration
do
not
have
lobbyists

a

favor
of

jim
rizoli

asked
why
some

have
so
many
immigrants
rizoli
said
the
brazilian
community
in
framingham
has
committed
economic
terrorism
there
sharry
said
that
what
rizoli
sees
as
economic
terrorists
are
hardworking
brazilians
to
those
who
support
relaxing
immigration
restirctions
it
has
happened
all
throughout

history
said
sharry
it
is
the
dynamic
identity
of
this
country
to
be
permanently
evolving
the
fact
is
we
