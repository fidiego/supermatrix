the
aclu
of
virginia
yesterday
urged
law
enforcement
agencies
to
ignore
attorney
general
ken
cuccinellis
opinion
on
their
power
to
inquire
about
immigration
status
while
opponents
of
illegal
immigration
pushed
for
more
severe
action
del
robert

marshall
rprince
william
who
sought
the
opinion
that
cuccinelli
issued
last
friday
sent
a
letter
yesterday
to
all
virginia
sheriffs
offices
to
encourage
them
to
do
all
that
you
can
using
the
powers
described
in
the
opinion
to
root
out
gangs
meanwhile
corey
a
stewart
chairman
of
the
prince
william
board
of
county
supervisors
and
an
opponent
of
illegal
immigration
said
yesterday
that
he
is
asking
congress
to
subpoena
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
known
as
ice
he
wants
congress
to
seek
information
about
criminal
illegal
immigrants
that
the
agency
no
longer
is
taking
into
physical
custody
the
developments
extended
the
contentious
debate
over
illegal
immigration
that
has
seized
the
public
discourse
after
cuccinellis
opinion
that
law
enforcement
in
virginia
can
ask
about
the
immigration
status
of
any
person
they
stop
or
arrest
if
they
have
reason
to
suspect
that
the
person
violated
a
criminal
immigration
law
gov
bob
mcdonnell
who
agrees
with
cuccinellis
opinion
took
to
cable
television
yesterday
to
talk
about
his
push
for
federal
approval
for
virginia
state
police
to
be
crosstrained
as
ice
agents
so
that
we
can
do
civil
immigration
enforcement
not
just
criminal
even
wednesday
night
as
the
governor
held
the
first
of
eight
town
hall
meetings
to
pitch
his
plan
for
privatizing
the
states
liquor
stores
two
out
of
the
first
three
questions
asked
by
attendees
were
about
illegal
immigration
stewarts
inquiry
comes
after
a
car
crash
in
prince
william
that
killed
a
nun
and
critically
injured
two
others
carlos
a
martinelly
montano
a
native
of
bolivia
and
an
illegal
immigrant
is
charged
in
the
crash
with
thirdoffense
driving
under
the
influence
involuntary
manslaughter
and
driving
on
a
revoked
license
yesterday
also
was
filled
with
mixed
messages
to
local
law
enforcement
from
the
aclu
of
virginia
and
from
marshall
the
aclu
of
virginia
urged
law
enforcement
to
disregard
cuccinellis
opinion
which
is
advisory
and
does
not
carry
the
force
of
law
the
opinion
according
to
rebecca
k
glenberg
legal
director
for
aclu
of
virginia
does
not
give
guidelines
as
to
when
its
justified
to
ask
questions
about
immigration
status
because
most
police
officers
have
not
been
trained
to
enforce
immigration
law
allowing
them
to
question
individuals
about
immigration
status
is
an
invitation
for
racial
profiling
and
potential
equal
protection
clause
violations
she
wrote
it
will
also
have
an
adverse
effect
on
public
safety
as
immigrants
will
be
less
likely
to
feel
safe
cooperating
with
law
enforcement
in
reporting
and
responding
to
questions
about
crimes
marshall
said
he
cannot
understand
why
the
aclu
would
encourage
ignoring
the
opinion
of
the
highest
ranking
lawenforcement
official
in
the
state
the
aclus
position
essentially
allows
alien
terrorists
and
gang
members
to
be
untouchable
in
this
country
he
said
we
cannot
allow
this
to
continue
cuccinelli
in
an
interview
wednesday
with
cnn
noted
that
the
new
arizona
immigration
law
parts
of
which
were
blocked
temporarily
by
a
federal
judge
required
lawenforcement
officers
to
inquire
about
immigration
status
he
noted
that
his
opinion
says
virginias
lawenforcement
officers
may
make
such
inquiries
he
said
he
expects
that
local
governments
around
the
state
will
devise
their
own
policies
for
how
their
police
and
sheriffs
should
proceed
