washington
the
nations
largest
association
of
police
chiefs
is
distributing
an
unusual
primer
on
immigration
enforcement
to
thousands
of
law
enforcement
agencies
saying
the
absence
of
a
national
immigration
policy
has
left
local
communities
with
an
overwhelming
burden
the
publication
by
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
iacp
discusses
immigration
laws
and
issues
including
daylaborer
hiring
sites
and
local
collaboration
with
federal
immigration
officials
it
stops
short
of
urging
local
authorities
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
but
says
agencies
can
no
longer
ignore
the
local
troubles
posed
by
the
explosive
growth
of
undocumented
immigrants
because
there
has
been
very
little
federal
assistance
on
this
issue
its
been
pushed
down
to
us
iacp
president
joseph
carter
said
our
frustration
is
that
this
has
now
become
an
issue
for
our
membership
immigration
enforcement
primarily
the
domain
of
the
federal
government
has
been
a
particularly
sensitive
issue
for
local
communities
local
police
leaders
face
a
growing
set
of
immigrationrelated
duties
in
the
face
of
scarce
and
narrowing
resources
the
45page
document
states
it
is
critically
important
for
local
agencies
to
avoid
being
caught
in
the
middle
of
endless
battles
over
immigration
policy
the
report
states
that
local
police
are
confronted
with
human
smuggling
operations
crime
victims
who
are
reluctant
to
cooperate
with
police
out
of
fear
they
will
be
deported
the
rejuvenation
of
hate
groups
targeting
new
immigrant
communities
community
disputes
involving
the
location
of
daylaborer
hiring
sites
or
complaints
related
to
overcrowded
housing
carter
said
the
document
circulated
tuesday
was
the
associations
response
to
numerous
requests
for
guidance
from
its
membership
which
numbers
about
20000
police
officials
what
we
have
provided
is
a
framework
to
help
guide
chiefs
how
they
deal
with
it
is
an
issue
for
their
political
leadership
we
cant
dictate
how
a
community
should
respond
so
far
the
collective
response
of
local
communities
has
produced
a
quilt
of
local
immigration
policies
some
cities
including
minneapolis
have
designated
their
communities
as
sanctuary
cities
where
police
are
directed
to
leave
immigration
enforcement
to
federal
authorities
jeremy
hanson
spokesman
for
minneapolis
mayor
rt
rybak
said
the
municipal
directive
extends
to
all
municipal
employees
including
those
who
manage
such
things
as
business
license
applications
its
a
clear
separation
based
on
the
value
that
it
is
essential
that
our
police
department
have
the
trust
of
the
community
hanson
said
in
phoenix
the
maricopa
county
sheriffs
department
has
sought
the
guidance
of
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
for
apprehending
immigration
law
offenders
more
than
a
dozen
other
police
agencies
have
sought
similar
assistance
despite
opposition
expressed
last
year
by
a
coalition
of
more
than
50
urban
police
chiefs
who
argued
that
immigration
enforcement
would
drain
limited
resources
needed
for
local
publicsafety
efforts
immigration
presents
a
confusing
picture
for
the
police
with
various
elements
of
the
community
taking
adversarial
positions
the
iacp
report
said
carter
hopes
the
iacps
primer
will
move
law
enforcement
to
a
more
consistent
approach
lacking
guidance
from
a
court
decision
or
the
federal
government
were
just
trying
to
find
the
best
way
to
move
ahead
