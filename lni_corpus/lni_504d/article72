washington
president
obamas
nonconfrontational
tone
on
an
immigration
overhaul
in
his
state
of
the
union
address
on
tuesday
night
probably
did
more
to
advance
the
issue
lawmakers
said
than
if
had
he
offered
a
fierce
rallying
cry
as
he
did
about
gun
restrictions
as
senators
gathered
wednesday
for
the
first
hearing
on
the
proposed
sweeping
changes
in
immigration
law
they
said
the
presidents
decision
to
give
members
of
both
parties
room
to
maneuver
on
the
delicate
politics
of
immigration
was
a
strategic
choice
that
could
pay
off
as
negotiations
continued
hes
walking
a
tightrope
here
trying
to
allow
congress
on
a
bipartisan
basis
to
come
up
with
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
in
the
senate
said
senator
richard
j
durbin
of
illinois
the
no
2
senate
democrat
he
encouraged
us
told
us
he
doesnt
want
this
to
drag
on
forever
and
if
we
cant
get
it
done
hell
play
more
forceful
role
mr
durbin
a
member
of
a
bipartisan
group
of
eight
senators
working
on
an
immigration
bill
added
the
reason
hes
on
this
tightrope
is
the
republicans
dont
want
to
make
it
appear
that
they
are
bending
to
the
president
on
this
issue
influential
republicans
praised
mr
obama
as
well
representative
paul
d
ryan
of
wisconsin
the
partys
vicepresidential
nominee
last
year
said
the
presidents
tone
on
immigration
was
measured
and
constructive
i
thought
on
immigration
he
used
the
right
words
and
the
right
tone
which
tells
me
he
actually
doesnt
want
to
politicize
this
which
is
conducive
to
getting
something
done
mr
ryan
said
given
their
losses
in
the
congressional
elections
in
november
republicans
in
both
the
house
and
senate
have
demonstrated
a
new
openness
to
immigration
changes
that
could
lead
to
legal
residency
for
millions
who
have
entered
the
country
illegally
at
the
same
time
polls
have
shown
that
the
presidents
involvement
in
the
debate
decreases
republican
support
white
house
officials
said
the
president
was
just
as
aggressive
on
immigration
as
he
was
on
firearms
though
his
appeal
for
changes
in
gun
laws
was
one
of
the
emotional
peaks
of
the
night
cecilia
mu√±oz
director
of
the
white
house
domestic
policy
council
said
immigration
was
an
issue
on
which
we
expect
an
outcome
and
we
expect
it
soon
the
president
who
most
recently
laid
out
his
own
immigration
principles
in
a
january
speech
in
las
vegas
told
congress
on
tuesday
night
that
the
time
has
come
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
it
was
a
refrain
he
repeated
several
times
to
applause
mr
obama
proceeded
to
highlight
what
he
believed
are
the
three
goals
of
any
immigration
deal
ensuring
that
the
borders
are
secure
creating
a
meaningful
path
to
citizenship
and
overhauling
the
system
to
deal
with
legal
immigration
but
when
talking
about
immigration
he
seemed
to
lack
the
emotional
resonance
not
to
mention
the
forceful
call
to
action
that
he
exhibited
when
discussing
gun
control
where
he
exhorted
the
country
to
remember
that
all
victims
of
gun
violence
deserve
a
vote
which
may
have
been
exactly
the
point
senator
charles
e
schumer
democrat
of
new
york
began
his
remarks
at
wednesdays
hearing
by
thanking
the
president
for
his
state
of
the
union
comments
on
immigration
his
remarks
last
night
on
immigration
were
just
right
mr
schumer
said
he
importuned
us
to
act
he
stated
how
important
it
was
to
get
this
done
for
the
future
of
america
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
make
it
a
wedge
issue
he
made
it
clear
that
we
had
to
act
in
a
bipartisan
way
and
gave
us
in
our
little
group
the
space
to
come
up
with
a
bipartisan
proposal
which
we
know
is
really
our
only
hope
senator
jeff
flake
republican
of
arizona
and
a
member
of
the
bipartisan
group
said
he
had
no
complaints
actually
i
thought
it
was
good
for
the
process
if
he
were
to
be
seen
as
leading
the
effort
it
likely
wouldnt
be
that
helpful
mr
flake
said
but
to
say
that
hell
sign
the
bill
we
put
on
his
desk
thats
helpful
the
hearing
focused
largely
on
border
security
and
enforcement
with
an
entire
panel
devoted
to
just
one
witness
secretary
janet
napolitano
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
ms
napolitano
said
that
border
security
was
often
used
as
an
excuse
to
prevent
meaningful
changes
but
in
a
glimpse
of
the
debate
to
come
ms
napolitano
met
resistance
from
key
republicans
including
senator
charles
e
grassley
republican
of
iowa
the
committees
ranking
member
and
senator
john
cornyn
republican
of
texas
over
enforcement
i
do
not
believe
that
the
border
is
secure
mr
cornyn
said
and
i
still
believe
we
have
a
long
long
way
to
go
the
four
democratic
senators
in
the
bipartisan
group
senators
michael
bennet
of
colorado
and
robert
menendez
of
new
jersey
as
well
as
mr
durbin
and
mr
schumer
were
to
meet
with
mr
obama
at
the
white
house
on
wednesday
evening
to
discuss
the
groups
progress
they
hope
to
introduce
their
legislation
in
march
