the
united
states
admitted
nearly
916000
legal
immigrants
last
year
a
sharp
increase
that
appears
likely
to
add
fresh
fuel
to
a
national
debate
over
the
appropriate
level
of
immigration
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
which
released
the
figure
yesterday
said
it
represents
a
27
percent
jump
from
fiscal
1995
and
resulted
from
increases
in
the
number
of
visas
granted
to
relatives
of
us
citizens
and
employersponsored
immigrants
plus
a
carryover
of
unused
visas
from
1995
that
increased

availability
of

immigrant
visas

1996
the
higher
admissions

citizens
immediate
relatives
which
rose
36
percent
and
have
no
numerical
caps
under
the
immigration
law
passed
last
year
were
driven
in
part
by
increased
processing
of
applications
by
illegal
immigrants
seeking
to
legalize
their
status
the
ins
said
the
increase
also
reflected

proimmigration
groups
immediately
sought
to
play
down
the
increase
in
legal
immigrants
arguing
that
it
represents
a
temporary
blip
that
would
give
way
to
a
decline
in
legal
immigration
levels
after
a
year
or
two
groups
that
favor
reducing
immigration
argued
that
the
number
is
alarmingly
high
and
urged
congress
to
take
another
look
at
legal
immigration
in
a
news
conference
coinciding
with
the
release
of
the
numbers
immigration
advocacy
groups
sought
to
head
off
any
move
by
restrictionists
to
argue
for
cuts
in
legal
immigration
legal
immigration
to
the
us
is
a
highly
regulated
and
tightly
controlled
system
that
is
in
the
national
interest
said
jeanne
a
butterfield
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
the
new
ins
numbers
represent
an
expected
onetime
bulge
that
is
largely
the
echo
of
the
1986
amnesty
program
she
referred
to
a
law
that
allowed
26
million
illegal
aliens
to
become
legal
residents
many
have
since
acquired
us
citizenship
and
petitioned
for
relatives
to
join
them
as
legal
immigrants
the
new
numbers
are
hardly
cause
for
alarm
said
stephen
moore
of
the
cato
institute
rather
he
said
they
are
very
good
news
although
as
an
economist
he
would
like
to
see
more
highly
skilled
people
among
them
restrictionists
meanwhile
expressed
concern
about
the
influx
of
large
numbers
of
people
with
less
than
a
high
school
education
37
percent
of
all
immigrants
from
1990
to
1996
according
to
a
new
census
bureau
report
over
the
next
five
years
america
will
admit
2
million
immigrants
who
lack
a
high
school
education
said
rep
lamar
s
smith
rtex
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
and
a
sponsor
of
last
years
bill
they
will
compete
directly
with
2
million
citizens
who
must
leave
welfare
and
find
jobs
he
said
it
makes
no
sense
to
force
unskilled
us
citizens
many
of
them
minorities
to
compete
with
new
immigrants
