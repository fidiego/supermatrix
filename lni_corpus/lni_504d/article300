come
to
america
to
work
for
a
better
life
the

described
real
immigration
reform
as
work
with
a
path
towards
citizenship
jaime
martinez
an
illegal
immigrant
from
mexico
who
attended
the
rally
said
the
proposals
are
persecuting
people
who
seek
better
lives
for
themselves
and
their
families
they
want
to
deny
us
education
but
they
dont
want
criminals
or
drug
dealers
on
the
streets
said
the
25yearold
poultry
industry
worker
its
not
right
some
bills
filed
have
sought
to
deny
public
education
to
illegal
immigrants
though
lawmakers
have
said
they
have
no
plans
to
pursue
those
frank
mulcahy
executive
director
of
the
georgia
catholic
conference
criticized
legislative
efforts
in
georgia
as
punitive
and
unchristian
how
many
of
you
would
like
to
take
this
legislation
and
show
it
to
him
on
judgment
day
mulcahy
asked
the
crowd
as
a
nation
we
do
have
a
right
to
protect
our
borders
but
we
must
recognize
every
person
is
an
individual
every
person
is
a
child
of
god
every
person
has
human
dignity
which
must
be
respected

of
no
amnesty

kings
group
held
aloft
signs
and
american
flags
king
estimated
his
rally
drew
about
74
people
we
are
here
because
