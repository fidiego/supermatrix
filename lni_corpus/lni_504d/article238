the

been
ordered
deported
by
an

who
support
strict
immigration

say
any

welcome
but
they
want
to
see
higher
arrest
numbers
given
a
half
million
illegals
in
new
jersey
2000
is
not
a
huge
number
whether
theyve
doubled
it
or
not

of
westwood
a
member
of
united
patriots
of
america
if
youre
talking
about
a
percentage
thats
20
percent
of
the
whole
population
of
illegals
then
thats
something
to
be
proud
of
but
this
is
less
than
1
percent
