immigration
law
once
shunned
as
a
backwater
of
the
legal
profession
is
being
transformed
into
a
respected
field
mainly
because
of
the
growing
impact
of
immigrants
on
us
businesses
and
changing
federal
immigration
policies
signs
of
this
newfound
respectability
can
be
seen
in
the
courtship
of
immigration
specialists
by
prominent
law
firms
in
washington
and
elsewhere
the
number
of
major
law
schools
now
offering
immigration
law
courses
and
the
dramatic
increase
in
lawyers
chosing
to
become
immigration
practitioners
from
foreign
policy
questions
to
civil
rights
concerns
immigration
law
is
drawing
a
new
breed
of
idealistic
young
lawyers
who
are
challenging
the
government
on
such
issues
as
the
treatment
of
haitian
boat
people
and
the
right
of
salvadorans
to
petition
for
political
asylum
in
the
past
the
common
perception
was
that
immigration
lawyers
worked
out
of
storefronts
and
were
sleazeballs
said
attorney
michael
maggio
who
practices
immigration
law
with
his
wife
candace
kattar
and
two
other
lawyers
in
dupont
circle
but
that
is
changing
now
because
immigration
touches
so
many
people
and
other
lawyers
are
turning
to
immigration
lawyers
for
advice
he
said
david
crosland
a
dc
lawyer
who
heads
the
general
practice
committee
on
immigration
law
of
the
american
bar
association
agrees
that
the
negative
stereotype
of
immigration
lawyers
is
becoming
a
thing
of
the
past
ten
years
ago
the
reputation
of
immigration
lawyers
was
less
savory
said
crosland
former
acting
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
now
i
see
that
changing
and
more
lawyers
are
getting
into
the
area
part
of
the
reason
for
the
nowfavorable
image
lies
in
the
increasing
connection
of
business
and
immigration
as
us
employers
seek
to
bring
in
skilled
foreign
workers
and
as
multinational
companies
try
to
set
up
businesses
here
many
immigration
lawyers
have
expanded
their
practice
beyond
helping
undocumented
maids
and
cooks
obtain
socalled
green
cards
to
assisting
large
corporations
bring
in
foreign
managers
engineers
and
computer
technicians
immigration
law
has
become
an
important
consideration
in
effectively
doing
business
in
the
us
both
for
companies
here
and
for
those
abroad
that
want
to
do
business
here
said
stanley
mailman
a
new
york
lawyer
who
has
practiced
immigration
law
for
33
years
the
1986
immigration
law
which
established
a
oneyear
amnesty
program
for
illegal
aliens
is
contributing
to
the
changing
attitude
toward
immigration
lawyers
under
the
law
employers
are
assessed
fines
for
hiring
illegal
workers
or
failing
to
keep
proper
work
records
on
all
employees
many
employers
are
turning
to
immigration
lawyers
for
help
the
practice
is
becoming
increasingly
employeroriented
and
increasingly
complicated
said
maggio
who
counts
among
his
clients
several
hotels
and
small
businesses
in
the
dc
area
and
hightech
companies
in
south
carolina
and
ohio
the
impact
of
employer
sanctions
refugee
policies
and
the
bringing
in
of
skilled
foreign
workers
were
at
the
top
of
the
agenda
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
recently
during
the
42yearold
professional
organizations
annual
meeting
in
san
diego
about
900
people
the
largest
turnout
in
the
history
of
the
association
attended
the
gathering
which
drew
top
ins
state
department
and
department
of
labor
officials
the
ins
presence
at
the
conference
was
viewed
as
an
indication
that
the
agency
has
modified
its
oncenegative
attitude
toward
immigration
lawyers
charlie
gordon
82
worked
for
ins
for
35
years
as
an
examiner
and
later
as
general
counsel
until
he
retired
in
1974
and
went
into
private
practice
as
an
immigration
lawyer
in
the
past
ins
officials
thought
the
lawyers
were
interlopers
that
when
the
lawyers
came
in
with
a
case
they
were
to
be
suspected
he
said
although
ins
and
lawyers
still
are
adversaries
gordon
said
their
relationship
today
is
much
more
cordial
now
ins
officials
meet
regularly
with
immigration
lawyers
association
members
to
share
information
and
sometimes
to
seek
approval
for
its
proposals
on
immigration
reform
gordon
said
the
association
started
in
1946
by
a
small
group
of
new
york
lawyers
who
previously
had
worked
for
ins
this
year
claims
about
2900
members
it
has
developed
over
the
past
four
or
five
years
from
a
provincial
northeastern
organization
to
a
national
organization
with
a
broad
range
of
practitioners
said
ira
kurzban
a
miami
lawyer
and
outgoing
president
of
the
association
in
addition
to
staying
abreast
of
developments
in
immigration
law
the
group
lobbies
for
changes
in
immigration
and
has
a
program
of
offering
free
legal
service
to
immigrants
and
refugees
association
executive
director
warren
leiden
said
that
about
300
law
schools
now
offer
courses
in
immigration
law
compared
with
just
a
few
10
years
ago
increasingly
permanent
faculty
members
at
the
major
law
schools
are
teaching
immigration
law
past
practice
was
to
let
adjunct
professors
teach
the
course
law
school
officials
said
peter
schauk
a
professor
at
yale
university
law
school
said
enrollment
in
his
immigration
law
course
has
grown
from
about
17
students
to
51
in
the
past
two
years
theres
a
growing
sense
that
immigration
law
can
be
lucrative
especially
because
increasingly
major
law
firms
are
offering
immigration
law
specialty
to
their
clients
schauk
said
at
the
university
of
virginia
law
school
professor
david
martin
has
taught
an
immigration
course
since
1982
and
next
year
he
plans
to
teach
a
seminar
on
refugee
law
he
said
some
of
his
students
have
gone
on
to
practice
immigration
law
at
corporate
firms
or
public
interest
firms
that
do
pro
bono
work
the
real
sign
that
immigration
is
catching
on
as
an
important
subject
is
that
a
lot
of
law
schools
that
are
not
in
major
immigration
areas
like
virginia
are
offering
an
immigration
law
course
said
martin
who
is
chairman
of
the
immigration
law
section
of
the
american
association
of
law
schools
larger
traditional
law
firms
are
establishing
immigration
departments
a
departure
from
the
past
practice
of
farming
out
immigration
cases
to
immigration
experts
or
turning
them
over
to
less
experienced
associates
in
the
firm
because
the
focus
of
immigration
law
in
the
past
has
been
on
individual
foreignborn
clients
who
were
seeking
a
legal
means
of
remaining
in
this
country
many
immigration
lawyers
are
sole
practitioners
or
work
with
a
few
other
lawyers
their
offices
for
the
most
part
are
small
and
homey
with
pictures
of
smiling
immigrants
or
folk
art
on
the
walls
but
some
of
the
largest
law
firms
are
moving
to
include
immigration
law
departments
as
they
seek
a
competitive
advantage
over
rival
firms
lawyers
said
other
firms
have
felt
compelled
to
hire
immigration
experts
as
their
corporate
clients
have
begun
to
demand
advice
on
complex
immigration
matters
i
dont
know
of
a
seasoned
immigration
lawyer
who
is
in
his
own
practice
who
hasnt
had
a
conversation
with
a
major
law
firm
in
the
last
12
months
about
coming
in
leiden
said
theres
a
lot
of
courtship
going
on
five
years
ago
lynda
zengerle
did
not
like
to
concede
that
she
practiced
immigration
law
i
had
heard
too
many
horror
stories
about
people
paying
a
lot
of
money
and
getting
ripped
off
and
felt
it
was
a
practice
i
couldnt
be
proud
of
she
said
but
that
has
changed
for
zengerle
who
two
weeks
ago
became
a
partner
at
the
downtown
law
firm
of
arent
fox
kintner
plotkin
kahn
where
she
has
been
head
of
the
immigration
department
for
three
years
its
a
sign
of
the
firms
commitment
to
immigration
law
zengerle
said
of
her
promotion
for
more
than
10
years
attorney
paul
schmidt
was
an
ins
employee
serving
for
a
while
as
deputy
general
counsel
and
then
for
about
a
year
as
acting
general
counsel
a
year
ago
however
he
left
the
goverment
and
joined
the
downtown
law
firm
jones
day
reavis
pogue
the
second
largest
law
firm
in
the
country
before
schmidt
joined
the
firm
one
lawyer
was
doing
immigration
work
part
time
now
it
has
a
fullfledged
immigration
section
with
five
attorneys
the
firm
started
to
see
the
interplay
between
international
law
tax
law
labor
law
and
immigration
law
schmidt
said
i
think
the
time
is
coming
when
every
major
law
firm
is
going
to
have
to
have
this
capacity
he
added
h
ronald
klasko
the
new
president
of
the
immigration
lawyers
association
recently
moved
from
a
mediumsize
philadelphia
firm
of
85
lawyers
to
the
international
law
firm
of
dechert
price
rhoads
with
200
lawyers
in
its
philadelphia
office
with
him
went
two
associates
two
paralegals
and
an
administrative
secretary
ive
been
in
the
field
for
10
years
and
the
way
the
profession
has
changed
has
been
mindboggling
he
said
but
klasko
still
worries
that
the
negative
image
many
people
have
of
immigration
lawyers
has
not
necessarily
caught
up
with
the
reality
and
he
hopes
that
the
association
can
launch
a
public
relations
program
in
the
next
year
to
help
change
the
stereotype
