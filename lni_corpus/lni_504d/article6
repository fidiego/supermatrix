if
immigration
is
a
hot
topic
the
practice
of
immigration
law
is
sizzling
tougher
immigration
policies
following
the
2001
terrorist
attacks
have
increased
demand
for
legal
advice
on
a
variety
of
immigration
matters
and
have
stirred
interest
among
lawyers
or
wouldbe
lawyers
in
working
with
those
hoping
to
make
america
their
home
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
based
in
washington
has
seen
its
membership
skyrocket
in
the
new
millennium
nearly
half
its
11000
members
joined
in
just
the
last
five
years
according
to
jennifer
lynch
ailas
membership
director
there
are
lots
of
attorneys
trying
to
get
on
the
immigration
bandwagon
lynch
said
either
lawyers
are
thinking
of
expanding
their
practice
to
include
immigration
or
lawyers
and
law
students
are
interested
in
focusing
on
immigration
and
new
jersey
a
state
that
consistently
ranks
near
the
top
nationwide
in
the
number
roughly
18
million
of
foreignborn
residents
is
a
natural
hotbed
of
immigration
activity
the
state
is
also
home
to
an
estimated
500000
undocumented
immigrants
in
hackensack
immigration
attorney
melvin
solomon
doesnt
need
statistics
for
proof
of
the
heightened
interest
in
his
field
which
with
everchanging
regulations
is
one
of
the
most
complex
in
law
i
see
more
and
more
new
faces
doing
immigration
law
than
ever
before
solomon
said
immigration
courts
are
getting
busier
there
are
more
illegal
immigrants
there
are
more
deportations
rules
have
gotten
stricter
for
hiring
foreign
workers
breaking
immigration
laws
carries
more
serious
consequences
these
days
often
immigrants
found
that
possessing
bogus
identification
documents
ignoring
a
judges
order
to
leave
the
us
or
driving
while
intoxicated
carried
little
serious
consequence
now
such
offenses
can
lead
to
arrest
jail
and
deportation
people
realize
now
that
even
things
that
may
not
seem
like
real
criminal
offenses
can
get
you
deported
thus
driving
up
the
demand
for
legal
counsel
solomon
said
those
in
the
field
say
their
specialty
attracts
many
idealists
compared
to
other
areas
of
law
such
as
tax
law
its
not
as
financially
rewarding
said
crystal
williams
ailas
deputy
director
of
programs
but
it
can
be
a
very
emotionally
rewarding
field
you
work
on
behalf
of
people
you
really
like
and
want
to
see
come
out
on
top
your
clients
are
people
who
are
trying
to
better
their
lives
or
are
running
from
inhumane
conditions
fast
facts
one
of
the
most
increasingly
appealing
areas
of
law
to
practice
is
immigration
due
to
the
growing
number
of
foreign
born
people
living
in
the
united
states
and
stricter
immigration
policies
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
has
seen
its
membership
ranks
swell
significantly
in
the
last
five
years
of
its
11089
members
nearly
47
percent
or
5187
joined
in
the
last
five
years
about
212
percent
or
2353
of
its
members
joined
more
than
10
years
ago
the
rest
joined
more
than
25
years
ago
lawyers
say
the
complexity
of
immigration
law
perhaps
is
rivaled
only
by
tax
law
