Â»
the
united
states
could
see
an
official
aboutface
in
the
coming
months
in
how
it
confronts
illegal
immigration
supreme
court
justices
weighing
arguments
over
arizonas
tough
immigration
law
seemed
to
find
little
problem
wednesday
with
provisions
that
require
police
to
check
the
legal
status
of
people
they
stop
for
other
reasons
over
the
last
several
years
states
frustrated
with
the
countrys
porous
borders
have
rejected
the
longheld
notion
that
washington
is
responsible
for
confronting
illegal
immigration
they
passed
laws
to
enable
local
police
to
address
the
problem
if
the
court
upholds
those
parts
of
arizonas
law
the
ruling
would
codify
that
type
of
local
enforcement
and
open
the
door
to
such
tactics
in
states
with
similar
laws
such
as
alabama
georgia
indiana
south
carolina
and
utah
i
think
youll
see
more
involvement
by
local
police
in
immigration
enforcement
an
involvement
that
hadnt
previously
been
seen
said
kevin
johnson
law
school
dean
at
the
university
of
californiadavis
and
an
immigration
law
expert
a
federal
judge
put
parts
of
the
arizona
law
on
hold
shortly
before
they
were
to
take
effect
in
july
2010
other
states
followed
with
similar
legislation
and
combined
with
other
state
immigration
laws
and
an
ailing
economy
played
a
part
in
tens
of
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
moving
elsewhere
if
you
want
to
turn
around
this
invasion
then
you
should
do
attrition
through
enforcement
said
former
state
sen
russell
pearce
architect
of
the
2010
law
and
the
driving
force
behind
other
arizona
immigration
laws
arizona
has
argued
it
pays
a
disproportionate
price
for
illegal
immigration
because
of
its
370mile
border
with
mexico
and
its
role
as
the
busiest
illegal
entry
point
into
the
country
the
obama
administration
said
the
law
conflicts
with
a
more
nuanced
federal
immigration
policy
that
seeks
to
balance
national
security
law
enforcement
foreign
policy
human
rights
and
the
rights
of
lawabiding
citizens
and
immigrants
during
arguments
over
the
law
liberal
and
conservative
justices
reacted
skeptically
to
the
administrations
argument
that
the
state
exceeded
its
authority
when
it
made
the
records
check
and
another
provision
allowing
suspected
illegal
immigrants
to
be
arrested
without
a
warrant
civil
rights
groups
say
arizonas
and
the
other
states
measures
encourage
racial
profiling
and
ethnic
stereotyping
immigrant
rights
advocates
who
believed
the
courts
would
reject
attempts
by
states
to
grab
more
law
enforcement
power
were
not
expecting
the
justices
response
they
said
a
supreme
court
validation
of
the
law
would
frighten
immigrants
further
and
cause
latinos
who
are
in
the
country
legally
to
be
asked
about
their
status
the
crisis
here
in
arizona
would
only
multiply
said
carlos
garcia
organizer
of
an
immigration
march
that
drew
several
hundred
people
in
downtown
phoenix
on
wednesday
authorities
said
at
least
nine
people
were
arrested
for
blocking
a
street
and
refusing
to
move
it
would
mean
that
anyone
as
they
are
leaving
their
home
whether
they
are
going
to
work
to
church
wherever
they
are
going
could
be
asked
for
their
documents
he
said
the
courts
comments
surprised
state
officials
and
had
thus
far
lost
all
major
court
battles
over
the
law
arizona
attorney
general
tom
horne
whose
office
has
helped
defend
the
law
predicted
the
court
will
uphold
the
law
because
many
of
its
provisions
mirror
existing
federal
laws
he
said
a
year
from
now
the
state
will
see
even
less
illegal
immigration
you
wont
see
anything
that
noticeable
as
far
as
law
enforcement
goes
horne
said
but
you
will
see
less
people
sneaking
across
the
border
it
was
unclear
what
the
court
would
do
with
other
aspects
of
the
law
that
have
been
put
on
hold
by
lower
federal
courts
the
other
blocked
provisions
make
it
a
state
crime
for
immigrants
not
to
have
immigration
registration
papers
and
for
illegal
immigrants
to
seek
work
or
hold
a
job
peter
spiro
a
tempe
university
law
professor
who
specializes
in
immigration
law
predicted
the
court
would
uphold
the
police
check
of
immigration
status
in
arizonas
law
but
said
he
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
court
threw
out
a
provision
making
it
a
crime
to
be
without
immigration
documents
such
a
ruling
would
let
police
question
people
about
their
immigration
status
if
they
have
good
reason
to
do
so
but
police
would
have
to
call
federal
authorities
to
see
if
they
would
want
to
pick
up
anyone
found
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
if
federal
agents
decline
officers
would
have
to
release
the
person
unless
they
were
suspected
of
committing
crimes
spiro
said
if
that
happened
the
law
would
be
mostly
symbolic
but
would
still
carry
some
significance
for
immigrants
spiro
said
it
would
make
it
clear
that
arizona
is
unfriendly
to
undocumented
aliens
spiro
said
a
decision
in
the
case
is
expected
in
late
june
