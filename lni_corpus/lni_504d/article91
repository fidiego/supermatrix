courts
ruling
monday
on

2010
immigration
law
upheld
a
controversial
portion
of
the
law
that
allows
local
police
to
ask
for
documents
proving
immigration
status
though
local
immigration
attorneys
said
this
provision
still
faces
a
battle
in
the
civil
rights
realm
and
even
though
texas
has
not
enacted
similar
legislation
some
attorneys
said
a
similar
show
me
your
papers
form
of
immigration
enforcement
on
the
local
level
occurs
here
in
the
rio
grande
valley
the
justices
reviewed
four
main
provisions
of
arizonas
much
contested
law
and
struck
down
three
as
they
said
federal
law
trumps
state
power
to
enact
immigration
laws
in
a
decision
that
split
the
justices
on
the
three
rejected
provisions
the
court
said
states
cannot
force
immigrants
to
carry
federal
registration
documents
cannot
make
it
a
state
crime
for
immigrants
to
accept
work
without
authorization
and
cannot
arrest
people
because
they
believe
them
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
but
a
unanimous
decision
allows
states
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
by
requiring
officers
to
check
immigration
status
of
those
detained
they
suspect
are
in
the
country
illegally
jaime

an
immigration
attorney
based
in
brownsville
said
the
justices
cautioned
states
that
this
portion
of
the
law
can
still
be
contested
with
other
constitutional
arguments
which
he
said
he
takes
as
a
sign
that
the
provision
could
later
be
struck
down
in
court
if
youre
going
to
enforce
it
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
do
it
they
dont
want
states
to
racially
profile
diez
said
but
how
do
you
do
it
without
profiling
unless
you
check
everybody
its
not
realistic
sara
sluszka
an
attorney
at
the
casa
de
proyecto
libertad
said
the
immigrants
rights
group
welcomes
the
decisions
to
strike
down
three
of
the
four
main
provisions
but
is
concerned
that
the
upheld
provision
is
impossible
to
enforce
without
racial
profiling
it
could
still
be
challenged
she
said
of
the
law
often
called
the
show
me
your
papers
provision
it
really
opens
up
a
lot
of
possibilities
for
racial
profiling
she
said
even
though
texas
has
not
followed
in
arizonas
footsteps
in
enacting
similar
legislation
both
sluszka
and
diez
said
they
frequently
see
racial
profiling
in
enforcing
immigration
violations
in
the
rio
grande
valley
through
cooperation
between
state
and
federal
authorities
for
example
diez
said
he
has
represented
hispanic
clients
who
speak
little
english
who
local
police
have
right
away
referred
to
border
patrol
when
detained
if
they
do
not
have
a
drivers
license
or
similar
identification
at
hand
in
that
sense
he
said
the
spirit
of
enforcing
show
me
your
papers
laws
occurs
here
though
it
is
enforced
through
a
localtofederal
referral
system
we
cant
stereotype
who
is
american
and
who
is
not
american
diez
said
sluszka
said
proyecto
libertad
frequently
receives
complaints
from
latino
customers
who
say
police
referred
them
to
federal
immigration
officials
if
they
could
not
provide
identification
during
a
traffic
stop
but
brownsville
interim
police
chief
orlando
rodriguez
said
the
department
is
not
in
the
business
of
enforcing
immigration
law
we
have
to
do
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
community
rodriguez
said
detectives
frequently
encounter
victims
and
witnesses
of
varying
citizenship
and
immigration
status
rodriguez
said
and
in
order
to
gain
the
trust
of
those
people
they
cannot
haphazardly
try
to
enforce
immigration
violations
police
need
their
cooperation
he
said
though
he
did
say
the
agency
closely
works
with
federal
immigration
authority
the
relationship
is
more
often
used
as
a
tool
to
fight
crime
in
the
sense
of
applying
immigration
laws
to
someone
who
has
committed
a
crime
locally
occasionally
if
we
do
stop
someone
involved
in
criminal
activity
we
can
make
referrals
rodriguez
said
but
it
is
not
our
policy
to
be
enforcing
immigration
laws
diez
said
he
hopes
the
ruling
will
lead
to
more
comprehensive
immigration
reform
nationally
instead
of
states
trying
to
enact
their
own
versions
of
immigration
law
this
cost
everybody
a
lot
of
money
and
we
are
still
in
the
same
place
we
were
two
years
ago
