25immigration
reform
is
becoming
a
reality
in
this
country
a
muchheralded
bipartisan
push
in
the
us
senate
could
produce
a
comprehensive
path
to
full
citizenship
for
millions
of
immigrants
who
are
living
in
america
illegally
the
catholic
church
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
progressive
immigration
reform
efforts
for
decades
undocumented
workers
many
of
whom
are
catholic
have
had
a
tireless
ally
in
their
church
perhaps
more
than
any
other
religion
in
the
united
states
we
are
a
faith
of
immigrants
new
york
cardinal
timothy
dolan
said
last
month
the
president
of
the
us
conference
of
catholic
bishops
usccb
was
emphatic
about
immigration
reform
being
an
essential
element
of
catholic
doctrine
this
isnt
some
wild
leftwing
cause
here
this
is
classic
catholic
teaching
he
said
as
we
speak
persons
are
being
deported
and
an
untold
number
of
families
are
being
divided
joining
cardinal
dolan
was
archbishop
jose
gomez
of
los
angeles
who
echoed
the
need
for
reform
that
affirms
the
rule
of
law
and
basic
human
rights
the
goal
of
the
legislation
is
to
solve
the
problem
in
a
humane
manner
then
all
undocumented
persons
should
be
able
to
participate
archbishop
gomez
said
a
cornerstone
of
the
nations
immigration
system
he
insisted
must
be
to
preserve
family
unity
with
laudable
solidarity
to
promote
social
justice
church
leaders
have
kept
the
pressure
on
lawmakers
to
do
the
right
thing
it
is
catholicism
at
its
best
forcefully
advocating
for
the
most
vulnerable
in
a
moving
sermon
to
more
than
1500
congregants
bishop
dennis
sullivan
of
camden
nj
said
the
church
was
championing
immigration
reform
in
congress
with
a
moral
urgency
we
have
not
had
in
the
last
decade
he
stressed
that
god
teaches
us
to
welcome
the
strangers
to
care
for
the
least
among
us
the
message
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
church
teaches
about
defending
the
rights
of
the
poor
the
marginalized
the
undocumented
families
it
speaks
to
bringing
the
oppressed
out
of
the
shadows
helping
them
possess
the
full
rights
and
responsibilities
of
citizenship
no
one
no
family
no
population
should
be
left
behind
except
gay
and
lesbian
immigrants
bless
their
misguided
souls
leave
them
behind
equal
immigration
treatment
is
humane
policy
for
everyone
but
samesex
couples
i
had
to
reread
a
letter
from
toledo
bishop
leonard
blair
tucked
into
a
recent
parish
bulletin
he
wrote
about
immigration
reform
as
an
issue
of
great
importance
for
our
country
and
for
the
church
at
first
i
presumed
he
intended
to
galvanize
diocesan
support
for
the
immigration
law
coming
together
on
capitol
hill
most
catholics
support
their
bishops
call
for
the
creation
of
an
immigration
system
that
respects
basic
human
rights
and
dignity
while
ensuring
the
integrity
of
our
borders
he
said
under
the
senate
immigration
bill
he
added
more
than
11
million
undocumented
persons
could
gain
legal
status
in
our
country
and
possibly
citizenship
the
bishop
instructed
local
parishes
to
publish
educational
material
from
the
bishops
conference
to
explain
why
the
church
is
concerned
about
immigration
from
a
religious
moral
and
social
perspective
so
far
so
good
then
came
the
caveat
as
the
legislative
process
moves
forward
issues
may
emerge
which
could
hinder
usccb
support
of
an
immigration
reform
bill
chief
among
them
would
be
the
addition
of
provisions
which
would
treat
samesex
couples
as
if
married
in
the
conferral
of
immigration
benefits
bishop
blair
wrote
the
letter
said
the
bishops
conference
is
working
to
ensure
that
these
provisions
are
not
included
in
any
final
legislation
sen
patrick
leahy
d
vt
who
sponsored
amendments
that
would
incorporate
samesex
couples
into
immigration
reform
countered
in
a
statement
for
immigration
reform
to
be
truly
comprehensive
it
must
include
protections
for
all
families
we
must
end
the
discrimination
that
gay
and
lesbian
families
face
in
our
immigration
law
not
if
the
bishops
can
help
it
their
objection
to
extending
protections
to
some
immigrants
threatens
passage
of
reform
for
all
bishop
blair
ended
his
letter
by
asking
parishioners
to
pray
for
a
just
resolution
of
this
issue
but
theres
nothing
just
about
working
to
exclude
some
of
our
brothers
and
sisters
who
are
presentday
immigrants
from
protection
pray
for
an
end
to
prejudice
