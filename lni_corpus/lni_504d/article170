its
easy
to
understand
why
mexican
president
felipe
calderon
spoke
out
against
arizonas
new
immigration
law
if
as
usual
you
follow
the
money
illegals
in
america
send
roughly
one
billion
untaxed
dollars
a
month
back
to
mexico
without
this
money
mexico
would
collapse
oh
wait
a
minute
mexico
has
already
collapsed
which
is
why
mexico
is
worse
off
than
detroit
and
why
mexicans
want
to
get
the
hell
out
of
mexico
what
is
ironic
is
that
mexico
enforces
the
same
basic
immigration
law
on
its
southern
border
with
guatemala
as
arizonas
new
immigration
law
which
few
in
the
obama
administration
have
actually
read
but
are
vehemently
opposed
to
this
is
despite
the
fact
that
arizonas
immigration
law
is
actually
not
as
stringent
as
the
federal
governments
immigration
law
which
no
one
in
the
obama
administration
wants
to
enforce
now
theres
some
fundamental
transformation
for
you
fundamentally
stupid
the
reason
the
obama
administration
does
not
want
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
is
that
they
want
to
make
democratic
slaves
voters
of
these
illegal
immigrants
by
granting
them
amnesty
when
mr
calderon
addressed
congress
and
condemned
arizonas
immigration
law
the
democrats
stood
and
applauded
watching
that
ugly
spectacle
was
a
sad
and
embarrassing
moment
for
america
unlike
the
obama
administration
and
the
democrats
in
congress
the
majority
of
americans
support
arizonas
new
law
and
believe
illegal
immigration
is
a
problem
that
will
not
be
solved
by
granting
millions
of
illegals
undeserved
legal
status
just
like
health
care
reform
the
obama
administration
is
once
again
grossly
out
of
step
with
logic
and
the
american
people
on
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
reasonable
people
can
debate
what
to
do
about
immigration
but
what
is
an
undeniable
truth
is
that
illegal
immigration
is
wreaking
financial
havoc
on
the
american
health
care
system
already
bloated
and
wasteful
social
welfare
programs
and
criminal
justice
systems
in
border
states
and
as
always
american
taxpayers
are
getting
stuck
with
this
very
expensive
bill
sticking
american
taxpayers
with
the
bill
for
illegal
immigration
because
fedzilla
does
not
want
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
is
condemnable
and
arrogant
dont
forget
this
when
you
enter
the
voting
booth
this
november
and
forever
more
if
we
can
put
a
man
on
the
moon
we
can
surely
stop
the
invasion
of
illegal
immigrants
pouring
across
our
porous
border
what
our
federal
government
lacks
is
the
political
will
to
stop
the
invasion
make
no
mistake
we
have
been
invaded
by
1015
million
illegals
and
we
have
virtually
done
nothing
to
stop
it
and
we
are
supposedly
a
nation
that
believes
in
the
rule
of
law
yeah
and
i
play
lead
banjo
in
a
hee
haw
documentary
just
because
there
are
people
such
as
myself
who
believe
we
should
enforce
our
immigration
regulations
and
support
arizonas
immigration
law
does
not
make
us
racists
or
jingoists
as
some
racists
and
jingoists
try
to
portray
us
to
be
attempting
to
smear
someone
as
a
racist
when
he
is
not
is
real
and
vicious
racism
on
parade
for
everyone
to
witness
i
have
no
problem
whatsoever
with
the
mexican
peoplemy
phenomenal
bass
player
marco
mendoza
is
mexican
like
marco
and
everyone
who
craves
the
american
dream
if
i
lived
in
mexico
i
would
do
whatever
i
could
to
escape
that
third
world
hellhole
to
provide
a
better
life
for
my
family
but
im
not
a
mexican
im
an
american
what
i
take
umbrage
with
is
those
who
believe
we
should
open
our
borders
and
allow
virtually
anyone
to
enter
america
if
you
want
more
illegals
in
america
just
provide
the
ones
already
here
with
legal
status
wrong
approach
not
only
does
illegal
immigration
impact
our
social
services
tremendously
but
i
also
believe
and
statistics
prove
that
our
porous
southern
border
is
an
open
invitation
for
any
terrorist
punk
to
walk
into
america
carrying
a
chemical
biological
or
other
type
of
weapon
of
mass
destruction
who
doesnt
know
this
fedzilla
has
one
primary
responsibility
to
the
american
people
protect
our
borders
and
keep
our
people
safe
so
far
so
bad
it
is
time
for
we
the
people
to
raise
a
new
level
of
hell
demanding
our
government
perform
its
duties
and
take
whatever
means
necessary
to
stop
the
invasion
fences
national
guard
and
orders
to
halt
the
lawbreakers
now
would
be
a
good
time
