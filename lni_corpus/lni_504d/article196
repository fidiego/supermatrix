will

be
on

all
inmates
booked
into
orange
county
jails
will
now
have
their
immigration
status
checked
part
of
a
national
effort
to
identify
and
deport
people
who
are
in
the

convicted
of

at

am

law
enforcement
officials
at
jails
from
santa
ana
to
laguna
beach
began
running
inmates
fingerprints
through
department
of
homeland
security
databases
the
program
called
secure
communities
determines
whether
inmates
have
had
any
contact
with
the
immigration
system
it
flags
immigration
officials
who
can
put
a
hold
on
those
who
are
believed
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
those
inmates
are
detained
for
48
hours
to
give
immigration
officials
a
chance
to
pick
them
up
its
a
tool
that
allows
us
to
do
our
jobs
more
effectively
said
david
venturella
executive
director
of
the
secure
communities
initiative
within
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
its
just
one
piece
of
an
overall
comprehensive
strategy
to
help
local
law
enforcement
allowing
us
to
better
identify
alien
criminals
and
remove
them
from
the
united
states
its
a
monumental
improvement
in
the
way
we
do
business
orange
county
joins
119
other
counties
in
the
nation
already
using
the
system
which
has
sparked
criticism
and
praise
from
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
officials
hope
to
launch
the
program
in
all
counties
by
2013
the
program
is
provided
at
no
cost
to
local
agencies
immigration
officers
already
work
at
the
costa
mesa
city
jail
at
the
county
jail
deputies
already
screen
inmates
immigration
status
under
a
partnership
with
the
federal
government
at
both
jails
inmates
who
say
they
are
foreignborn
receive
additional
screening
to
check
legal
status
the
new
program
is
more
accurate
because
all
inmates
not
just
those
who
say
they
are
foreignborn
will
be
screened
for
immigration
status
venturella
said
this
is
more
automatic
orange
county
sheriffs
cmdr
dave
wilson
said
currently
people
come
in
off
the
street
and
folks
interview
if
they
dont
selfproclaim
residency
or
legal
status
outside
of
the
united
states
we
dont
have
a
real
way
of
confirming
unless
they
trip
up
or
something
like
that
while
deputies
who
received
immigration
crosstraining
could
tap
into
federal
databases
before
the
programs
launch
wilson
said
it
didnt
work
as
quickly
as
it
does
now
and
some
inmates
may
have
slipped
through
the
cracks
the
new
system
still
misses
people
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
but
never
had
contact
with
the
immigration
system
thats
where
the
crosstrained
screeners
could
step
in
and
ask
more
questions
to
determine
an
inmates
true
legal
status
wilson
said
how
it
works
instead
of
allowing
only
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
check
the
fbi
database
for
criminal
history
during
a
fingerprint
scan
the
program
is
also
linked
to
federal
immigration
databases
to
screen
a
persons
immigration
record
the
fbi
and
federal
immigration
check
happens
simultaneously
when
there
is
a
fingerprint
match
the
system
automatically
flags
immigration
officials
in
most
cases
inmates
will
finish
serving
their
sentences
before
they
are
transferred
to
immigration
custody
for
possible
deportation
still
federal
officials
said
they
dont
have
enough
resources
to
pick
up
everyone
in
the
system
as
an
illegal
immigrant
we
have
a
limited
amount
of
resources
venturella
said
our
objective
would
be
to
identify
and
remove
all
criminal
aliens
from
the
united
states
like
any
governmental
agency
or
business
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
dollars
coming
in
he
said
the
agency
is
focusing
on
the
worst
criminal
offenders
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
this
means
those
who
are
arrested
on
suspicion
of
committing
violent
crimes
such
as
murder
rape
and
kidnapping
immigration
officials
may
get
some
nonviolent
offenders
to
leave
the
us
voluntarily
while
others
may
end
up
back
in
the
community
from
october
2009
until
the
end
of
february
immigration
officials
arrested
or
issued
detainers
against
21556
people
nationwide
who
were
identified
as
being
in
the
country
illegally
and
charged
or
convicted
of
crimes
of
those
4523
were
arrested
on
suspicion
of
or
convicted
of
violent
crimes
about
14741
have
already
been
removed
from
the
country
some
have
been
identified
but
not
yet
removed
they
are
completing
their
sentences
critics
on
both
sides
immigration
officials
said
the
new
screening
avoids
concerns
about
racial
profiling
because
everyones
fingerprints
are
checked
however
the
program
doesnt
stop
law
enforcement
officials
from
making
arrests
based
on
racial
profiling
said
joan
friedland
immigration
policy
director
for
the
national
immigration
law
center
an
immigrant
advocacy
group
in
addition
she
said
she
was
concerned
about
immigration
agents
deporting
people
who
dont
have
serious
criminal
convictions
other
critics
said
they
worry
immigration
officials
are
too
preoccupied
with
identifying
criminals
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
and
arent
placing
enough
emphasis
on
deporting
them
in
an
efficient
manner
its
not
enough
to
just
find
people
you
have
to
wonder
what
good
it
does
to
identify
all
these
people
if
they
are
not
going
to
be
removing
everyone
who
should
be
removed
were
not
getting
real
bang
for
our
buck
yet
said
jessica
vaughan
director
of
policy
studies
at
the
center
for
immigration
studies
venturella
acknowledges
that
for
now
the
program
has
enough
funding
to
process
only
the
most
serious
offenders
