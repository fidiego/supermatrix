illegal
immigration
bill
draconian
or
common
sense
a
bill
passed
by
the
arizona
state
legislature
takes
aim
at
illegal
immigration
by
directing
police
to
look
into
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
whom
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
is
in
the
country
unlawfully

arizona
lawmakers
on
wednesday
approved
some
of
the
toughest
immigration
legislation
in
the
us
heightening
debate
on
how
far
is
too
far
to
go
to
curb
illegal
immigration
and
prompting
renewed
calls
for
federal
immigration
reform
arizona
senate
bill
1070
which
passed
the
state
house
of
representatives
tuesday
and
is
expected
to
be
signed
by
republican
gov
jan
brewer
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
lack
proper
immigration
paperwork
in
arizona
and
directs
police
to
determine
immigration
status
if
they
are
suspicious
of
criminal
activity
currently
officers
can
inquire
about
a
persons
immigration
status
only
if
that
person
is
a
suspect
in
another
crime
immigration
reform
groups
see
the
approach
as
a
logical
expansion
of
state
authority
when
they
say
the
federal
government
is
not
doing
its
job
immigrant
rights
groups
call
it
far
too
severe
saying
it
would
freeze
any
trust
that
exists
between
immigrant
communities
and
local
police
departments
and
could
domino
negatively
to
other
states
in
pictures
the
usmexico
border
arizonas
decision
to
advance
such
a
draconian
and
highly
questionable
piece
of
legislation
reveals
the
moral
crisis
our
nation
is
facing
as
we
confront
options
on
how
to
best
deal
with
illegal
immigration
and
the
millions
of
families
who
live
and
work
in
our
midst
said
angelica
salas
of
the
coalition
for
humane
immigrant
rights
of
los
angeles
chirla
in
a
statement
she
warns
that
if
passed
into
law
the
bill
would
open
the
state
to
a
raft
of
racial
profiling
and
wrongful
arrest
lawsuits
but
the
legislation
is
warranted
say
others
while
illegal
immigration
has
trailed
off
recently
high
profile
cases
such
as
the
killing
of
rancher
robert
krentz
have
raised
public
awareness
and
according
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
state
has
seen
a
42
percent
increase
in
the
number
of
illegal
immigrants
living
there
between
2000
and
2009
the
bills
author
state
sen
russell
pearce
responds
simply
that
the
measure
is
going
to
take
the
handcuffs
off
of
law
enforcement
and
put
them
on
the
bad
guys
with
compassion
but
without
apology
arizonas
sb
1070
is
a
nononsense
commonsense
example
of
a
state
acting
where
the
federal
government
is
failing
says
dustin
carnevale
spokesman
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
this
legislation
is
a
reaction
to
the
inaction
of
washington
with
regard
to
border
security
and
immigration
enforcement
mr
carnevale
says
that
sb
1070
is
simply
the
next
logical
step
in
arizonas
attempts
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
and
protect
its
citizens
he
points
to
a
2006
arizona
law
that
would
penalize
companies
with
a
pattern
of
hiring
illegal
aliens
and
a
measure
last
year
that
made
it
a
crime
for
a
state
worker
to
give
improper
benefits
to
an
illegal
alien
its
no
surprise
that
a
state
that
has
been
hit
the
hardest
with
17
billion
annually
on
illegal
immigration
and
the
recent
tragic
murder
of
rancher
robert
krentz
would
produce
such
stringent
legislation
says
carnevale
but
other
groups
have
already
picketed
outside
the
gov
brewers
office
in
phoenix
urging
her
to
veto
the
bill
and
they
promise
legal
challenges
and
more
the
national
day
laborer
organizing
network
ndlon
for
instance
planned
a
demonstration
outside
the
federal
building
in
downtown
los
angeles
thursday
with
legal
analysts
to
spotlight
why
the
bill
is
unconstitutional
and
they
say
there
will
be
giant
marches
in
the
street
across
the
country
as
there
were
over
the
federal
sensenbrennersponsored
immigration
bill
in
2006
and
2007
this
is
racial
profiling
of
the
most
hurtful
kind
and
is
way
beyond
the
pale
says
pablo
alvarado
director
of
ndlon
this
has
been
the
strategy
of
the
antiimmigration
forces
from
the
beginning
to
make
life
so
miserable
for
immigrants
that
they
will
selfdeport
i
promise
there
will
be
plenty
of
lawsuits
over
this
and
we
wont
stop
until
this
is
declared
unconstitutional
everyone
has
to
know
we
are
not
going
to
take
this
we
will
fight
ms
salass
organization
has
been
coordinating
immigrant
rights
groups
nationally
to
push
for
comprehensive
federal
immigration
reform
arizonas
kneejerk
reaction
should
be
a
wakeup
call
to
washington
she
says
that
a
hodgepodge
of
immigration
enforcement
laws
is
likely
to
result
in
more
chaos
throughout
the
nation
not
the
longterm
solution
