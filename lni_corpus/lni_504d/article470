the
white
house
is
preparing
to
reject
a
federal
advisory
commissions
recommendation
to
abolish
the
troubled
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
assign
its
duties
to
other
government
agencies
officials
said
today
instead
the
clinton
administration
proposes
reorganizing
the
agency
to
clarify
its
dual
some
say
conflicting
roles
of
battling
illegal
immigration
and
giving
benefits
to
legal
immigrants
toward
that
end
it
has
hired
a
major
consulting
firm
boozallen
hamilton
to
help
work
out
the
details
of
the
redesign
a
white
house
official
who
participated
in
the
review
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
right
now
were
not
ready
to
embrace
the
commissions
proposal
to
disband
the
ins
but
many
of
its
points
are
valid
and
reform
is
necessary
white
house
officials
insist
that
president
clinton
and
his
top
aides
have
not
made
any
final
decisions
and
that
mr
clinton
will
outline
his
plan
in
the
fiscal
1999
budget
he
proposes
to
congress
early
next
month
but
other
government
and
congressional
officials
say
they
have
been
notified
that
a
white
house
review
has
decided
in
principle
against
splitting
up
the
agency
as
the
united
states
commission
on
immigration
reform
recommended
in
september
even
before
the
administrations
plan
was
formally
announced
republicans
on
capitol
hill
who
have
been
exploring
the
idea
of
disbanding
the
agency
expressed
skepticism
that
a
reorganization
plan
would
solve
the
problems
the
proposal
to
split
the
agency
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
vetted
further
said
senator
judd
gregg
the
new
hampshire
republican
who
heads
the
senate
appropriations
subcommittee
that
controls
the
immigration
services
spending
it
is
a
major
move
and
i
dont
subscribe
to
it
carte
blanche
but
it
may
be
the
best
way
to
go
but
i
dont
think
this
requires
another
outside
consultant
to
review
the
management
structure
at
issue
is
the
advisory
panels
conclusion
that
the
immigration
service
suffers
from
such
mission
overload
that
it
can
no
longer
manage
its
many
priorities
effectively
the
panel
recommended
that
the
justice
department
the
immigration
services
parent
agency
retain
responsibility
for
controlling
the
border
and
removing
illegal
immigrants
the
state
department
which
now
deals
with
visas
at
american
embassies
overseas
would
handle
immigration
services
and
benefits
like
citizenship
requests
the
labor
department
would
assume
a
greater
role
in
overseeing
the
hiring
of
foreign
workers
breaking
up
the
immigration
service
is
an
idea
that
has
bounced
around
washington
for
at
least
a
decade
but
the
proposal
has
gained
greater
currency
lately
as
congress
and
many
of
the
nations
governors
are
growing
increasingly
exasperated
with
the
immigration
services
inability
to
cope
with
soaring
requests
for
citizenship
to
weed
out
criminal
aliens
living
in
the
united
states
and
to
crack
down
on
the
steady
stream
of
illegal
immigrants
entering
the
country
republicans
greeted
the
administrations
plan
for
a
reorganization
and
outside
review
with
skepticism
and
said
they
would
continue
to
consider
more
drastic
changes
senator
spencer
abraham
the
michigan
republican
who
heads
the
senate
immigration
subcommittee
said
last
august
we
should
consider
splitting
the
ins
up
into
one
law
enforcement
agency
and
one
legal
immigration
agency
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
both
a
spokesman
for
mr
abraham
joe
mcmonigle
said
today
that
the
senator
stood
by
his
remarks
and
would
hold
hearings
early
this
year
on
reorganizing
the
agency
the
house
appropriations
committee
last
summer
directed
attorney
general
janet
reno
to
review
the
commissions
report
and
along
with
other
federal
agencies
develop
a
restructuring
plan
by
april
1
that
would
allow
the
immigration
service
to
perform
its
duties
more
efficiently
in
response
the
white
houses
domestic
policy
council
interviewed
a
wide
variety
of
officials
in
government
congress
and
independent
groups
about
the
advisory
panels
conclusions
for
the
most
part
there
was
support
for
reform
but
not
for
the
commissions
recommendation
to
disband
the
agency
said
the
white
house
official
who
was
involved
in
the
review
ms
reno
and
doris
m
meissner
the
commissioner
of
immigration
and
naturalization
vociferously
opposed
any
proposal
to
abolish
the
agency
and
urged
the
white
house
to
let
them
solve
the
agencys
problems
mrs
meissner
argued
that
the
agency
had
recently
achieved
significant
victories
in
tightening
the
nations
asylum
system
and
the
border
with
mexico
south
of
san
diego
and
deserved
a
chance
to
clean
its
own
house
at
the
same
time
other
agencies
that
would
assume
duties
from
the
immigration
service
were
cool
to
the
idea
the
state
department
for
example
argued
that
it
was
already
absorbing
the
arms
control
and
disarmament
agency
and
the
united
states
information
agency
mrs
meissner
said
white
house
officials
notified
her
in
late
december
that
the
immigration
agency
would
remain
intact
the
immigration
service
then
hired
boozallen
to
a
twomonth
contract
for
374498
that
requires
the
consultants
to
give
their
recommendations
by
march
1
by
laying
out
a
detailed
reorganization
before
congresss
april
1
deadline
administration
officials
say
they
hope
to
head
off
any
effort
by
republicans
to
use
the
agencys
troubles
as
a
political
issue
in
the
1998
elections
