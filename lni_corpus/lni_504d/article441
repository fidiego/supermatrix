texas
gov
rick
perry
is
turning
texas
into
an
outcast
by
elevating
immigration
issues
to
an
emergency
level
and
by
insisting
that
local
law
enforcement
officials
be
allowed
to
enforce
immigration
laws
el
pasos
four
highestranking
elected
officials
said
friday
if
perry
and
the
state
legislature
pass
such
laws
some
of
which
have
already
been
filed
el
pasos
status
as
the
safest
city
will
be
jeopardized
said
us
rep
silvestre
reyes
dtexas
it
will
turn
border
communities
into
havens
for
criminals
who
will
prey
on
undocumented
immigrants
and
exploit
their
fears
and
silence
reyes
said
we
think
this
is
bad
policy
reyes
was
one
of
four
citywide
elected
leaders
who
gathered
friday
in
el
paso
to
blast
perrys
immigration
agenda
the
others
were
newly
elected
state
sen
jos
rodrguez
del
paso
newly
elected
county
judge
veronica
escobar
and
mayor
john
cook
all
four
said
the
governors
immigration
agenda
will
hurt
el
paso
and
texas
the
governor
disputes
their
allegations
his
spokeswoman
said
the
el
paso
leaders
are
misrepresenting
what
the
governor
is
trying
to
do
lucy
nashed
a
spokeswoman
for
perry
said
the
governor
has
no
interest
in
turning
local
law
enforcement
officers
into
immigration
officers
even
though
the
federal
government
is
failing
to
put
enough
agents
in
texas
he
just
wants
local
law
enforcement
to
have
the
discretion
to
ask
about
immigration
status
while
they
are
performing
their
regular
duties
she
said
the
governors
overall
goal
she
said
is
simply
to
strengthen
homeland
and
border
security
that
is
why
the
governor
placed
immigration
on
the
legislatures
emergency
agenda
she
said
the
emergency
status
designation
means
the
legislature
can
pass
immigration
laws
during
the
first
30
days
of
the
legislative
session
rodrguez
who
was
elected
senator
in
november
said
texas
has
more
pressing
needs
than
immigration
with
texas
facing
a
27
billion
deficit
and
projected
cuts
to
health
and
human
services
and
education
thats
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
rodrguez
said
it
was
very
illadvised
to
make
this
an
emergency
item
rodrguez
said
immigration
is
not
an
emergency
because
federal
agents
in
el
paso
are
doing
an
effective
job
of
stopping
illegal
immigration
according
to
us
customs
and
border
protection
statistics
12251
undocumented
immigrants
were
arrested
last
year
in
the
el
paso
region
that
is
a
significant
drop
from
1992
when
248642
undocumented
immigrants
were
arrested
in
el
paso
customs
and
border
protection
commissioner
alan
bersin
recently
toured
the
border
to
show
that
the
agencys
efforts
in
texas
and
california
have
stopped
the
illegal
immigration
and
drug
smuggling
that
was
occurring
in
1990s
and
in
the
early
2000s
bersin
who
met
with
local
officials
said
the
focus
is
now
on
arizona
where
illegal
immigration
has
increased
escobar
said
perrys
desire
to
have
local
law
enforcement
ask
immigration
questions
is
another
unfunded
mandate
that
will
cost
local
taxpayers
we
will
have
to
spend
local
taxpayer
money
to
train
our
police
officers
and
deputies
on
immigration
laws
she
said
and
we
will
have
to
spend
local
tax
money
on
keeping
those
people
they
arrest
in
our
jails
more
than
40
immigrationrelated
bills
have
been
filed
this
legislative
session
some
of
the
bills
already
filed
would
make
it
illegal
for
immigrants
to
sue
us
citizens
others
state
that
only
children
born
of
us
parents
can
be
us
citizens
a
couple
of
the
bills
would
allow
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
make
people
prove
they
are
us
citizens
