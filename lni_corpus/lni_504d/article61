the
national
mood
on
immigration
has
changed
dramatically
since
arizona
approved
a
firstofitskind
immigration
law
igniting
a
furor
over
border
security
and
the
countrys
treatment
of
immigrants
a
mere
three
years
later
president
barack
obama
and
republicans
and
democrats
in
congress
are
lobbying
for
the
nations
first
immigration
overhaul
in
nearly
three
decades
and
public
opinion
is
on
their
side
the
remarkable
and
almost
shocking
shift
has
renewed
debate
in
arizona
and
other
states
opposed
to
mass
immigration
about
whether
its
time
to
double
down
or
back
off
arizonas
law
drew
international
complaints
of
unlawful
police
scrutiny
and
inspired
a
handful
of
copycat
policies
across
the
country
the
centerpiece
of
the
measure
requires
police
to
question
suspects
about
their
immigration
status
a
provision
that
would
be
vastly
undermined
if
millions
of
immigrants
are
able
to
obtain
legal
status
arizona
was
is
and
will
always
be
concerned
primarily
about
border
security
said
state
rep
john
kavanagh
one
of
the
republican
architects
behind
the
bill
no
matter
how
much
they
wish
they
are
not
going
to
get
the
american
people
to
turn
their
back
on
border
security
and
the
rule
of
law
kris
kobach
kansas
secretary
of
state
and
the
author
of
arizonas
immigration
law
also
remains
an
avid
defender
of
selfdeportation
policies
as
the
best
defense
against
illegal
immigration
arizona
has
proved
if
you
ratchet
up
the
penalties
people
comply
kobach
said
monday
during
a
senate
hearing
on
immigration
the
proposed
immigration
overhaul
would
allow
tens
of
thousands
of
new
high
and
low
skilled
workers
into
the
country
and
extend
legal
rights
for
some
11
million
immigrants
already
here
it
also
seeks
to
strengthen
border
security
and
includes
stiff
penalties
for
illegal
immigration
signs
that
arizonas
legacy
of
tough
enforcement
lives
on
but
the
rhetoric
against
illegal
immigration
has
become
much
more
polite
since
2010
when
the
fervor
was
at
a
climax
and
arizona
passed
senate
bill
1070
then
a
national
campaign
to
end
birthright
citizenship
warned
of
asian
and
hispanic
mothers
darting
across
borders
to
empty
their
wombs
on
us
soil
candidates
ran
for
the
us
house
with
tv
spots
featuring
menacing
mexicans
there
was
talk
of
kidnappings
gangs
drug
cartels
and
desert
beheadings
these
days
both
of
arizonas
republican
us
senators
are
among
those
leading
the
immigration
overhaul
effort
the
arizona
state
lawmaker
who
created
the
landmark
immigration
law
was
forced
out
by
voters
and
the
proposal
advancing
in
congress
would
grant
legal
status
to
most
immigrants
illegally
in
the
country
we
are
looking
at
a
major
shift
in
public
opinion
said
tony
payan
of
the
james
a
baker
iii
institute
for
public
policy
at
rice
university
in
texas
it
took
us
all
by
storm
republicans
and
democrats
alike
say
the
turning
point
was
the
november
elections
when
hispanic
and
asian
voters
overwhelmingly
swept
obama
into
a
second
term
after
years
of
antiimmigrant
rhetoric
from
the
gop
and
just
months
after
the
obama
administration
announced
an
unprecedented
policy
allowing
young
immigrants
to
seek
legal
status
while
republican
president
george
w
bush
won
more
than
40
percent
of
the
latino
vote
in
2004
romney
received
27
percent
hispanic
support
less
than
any
presidential
candidate
in
16
years
if
we
pass
this
bill
i
dont
think
we
gain
a
single
hispanic
vote
immediately
said
arizona
sen
john
mccain
when
unveiling
the
national
immigration
legislation
last
week
what
it
does
is
it
puts
us
on
a
level
playing
field
to
compete
for
those
votes
america
has
a
long
history
of
suspicion
toward
immigrants
said
mark
hugo
lopez
associate
director
for
the
pew
hispanic
center
in
washington
dc
nearly
two
decades
ago
most
americans
considered
immigrants
a
burden
on
the
country
in
march
only
41
percent
of
americans
said
they
still
felt
that
way
lopez
said
young
liberal
voters
are
shaping
public
opinion
but
so
are
hispanics
who
comprised
163
of
the
population
in
2010
up
from
125
percent
in
2000
in
all
more
than
40
million
hispanic
will
be
eligible
to
vote
in
2030
according
to
pew
data
a
steady
decline
in
illegal
immigration
since
2006
and
a
gradual
economic
recovery
that
put
the
national
unemployment
rate
at
a
fouryear
low
in
march
have
also
influenced
changes
in
the
immigration
debate
people
are
really
tired
of
the
issue
and
they
want
it
to
go
away
said
audrey
singer
a
senior
fellow
specializing
in
immigration
policy
at
the
brookings
institution
in
washington
dc
the
recognition
that
it
is
better
to
know
who
is
living
in
our
country
and
to
bring
them
out
of
the
shadows
so
that
all
workers
benefit
seems
to
resonate
with
people
in
recent
months
state
lawmakers
across
the
country
have
debated
extending
rights
to
immigrants
living
in
the
country
illegally
including
greater
access
to
higher
education
and
drivers
licenses
democratic
state
sen
steve
gallardo
has
worked
for
years
to
overturn
arizonas
immigration
law
but
he
has
largely
been
ignored
by
the
republicanled
legislature
the
conversation
in
washington
is
a
sign
that
the
state
law
has
a
dim
future
gallardo
said
this
is
what
america
wants
he
said
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
but
public
sentiment
on
immigration
could
easily
turn
again
with
a
change
in
the
economy
or
an
overreach
by
congress
said
ira
mehlman
a
spokesman
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
opposes
the
proposed
national
overhaul
