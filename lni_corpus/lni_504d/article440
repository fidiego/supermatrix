length
566
words
were
tackling
the
meaty
topic
of
immigration
in
a
new
way
on
elpasotimescom
we
have
enlisted
local
attorney
kathleen
walker
easily
one
of
the
sharpest
minds
on
issues
related
to
federal
immigration
law
to
pen
a
blog
called
immigration
in
focus
through
the
blog
we
hope
to
help
readers
gain
a
greater
comprehension
of
existing
federal
law
and
to
help
them
navigate
the
efforts
of
texas
and
other
states
across
the
country
as
they
attempt
to
tackle
immigrationrelated
legislation
some
600
people
joined
us
online
for
a
chat
with
walker
this
past
week
as
we
introduced
her
and
the
immigration
in
focus
blog
on
elpasotimescom
these
formats
online
chats
with
experts
and
blogs
dedicated
to
topics
relevant
to
the
el
pasoju√°rez
border
are
becoming
an
important
ingredient
to
the
mix
of
content
found
on
el
pasos
leading
website
whats
great
about
the
chats
and
our
blogs
is
that
they
are
interactive
and
geared
to
taking
your
questions
and
getting
your
input
if
youve
not
looked
at
either
the
chats
or
our
lineup
of
bloggers
they
are
easily
found
at
elpasotimescomlive
for
the
chats
and
elpasotimescomblogs
for
the
immigration
in
focus
blog
or
any
of
the
other
blogs
we
produce
we
will
participate
with
thousands
of
people
throughout
the
year
by
hosting
chats
and
our
blogs
collectively
will
reach
a
million
pageviews
in
traffic
this
year
walkers
addition
to
our
lineup
of
bloggers
is
a
nobrainer
she
began
practicing
immigration
law
in
el
paso
in
1985
after
graduating
from
the
university
of
texas
school
of
law
she
says
her
main
areas
of
practice
are
business
and
familybased
immigration
consular
processing
admissibility
issues
naturalization
worksite
enforcement
and
investor
options
the
blog
she
says
will
focus
on
immigrationpolicy
issues
and
shedding
some
light
on
how
the
current
law
actually
works
especially
in
relation
to
proposed
legislation
i
think
most
of
us
in
the
us
do
not
have
any
direct
interaction
with
how
the
us
immigration
system
works
she
told
our
online
audience
that
basic
lack
of
interaction
makes
it
harder
to
appreciate
how
state
as
well
as
federal
legislative
proposals
may
impact
the
state
or
local
economy
a
communitys
safety
and
just
daytoday
living
for
example
many
do
not
realize
that
just
the
basic
action
of
marrying
a
us
citizen
conveys
no
immigration
status
the
current
mess
i
see
most
is
states
attempting
to
regulate
in
the
federal
area
of
immigration
there
are
130
various
bills
in
the
texas
legislature
that
in
some
fashion
circle
immigration
walker
says
they
generally
address
areas
related
to
mandating
the
use
of
everify
for
employers
requiring
local
law
enforcement
to
fully
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
identification
requirements
tied
to
immigration
status
eg
for
school
enrollment
birthright
citizenship
challenges
restriction
of
court
access
or
remedies
english
as
the
official
language
investigation
of
immigration
status
as
a
part
of
a
lawenforcement
action
voter
id
transporting
undocumented
workers
trespassing
lets
say
they
are
still
coming
and
now
you
know
why
we
decided
an
expert
like
walker
and
a
blog
called
immigration
in
focus
would
go
a
long
way
in
helping
us
all
comprehend
this
meaty
topic
