reform
placed
on

in
the

groups
supporting
and
opposing

in

policy
are
intensifying
their
efforts
to
bring
about
change
once
a
new
administration
and
congress
come
to
washington
activists
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
divide
agree
that
the
selection
of
senator
john
mccain
as
the
republican
presidential
nominee
sidelined
the
immigration
debate
although
republicans
and
democrats
have
fiercely
argued
the
issue
mccains
views
on
immigration
are
closer
to
those
of
his
rival
senator
barack
obama
than
to
the
republican
party
line
given
this
odd
political
alignment
neither
side
seems
to
have
an
interest
in
moving
immigration
issues
to
the
top
of
the
debate
an
immigration
raid
that
took
place
may

at
the
postville
iowa
kosher
meatprocessing
plant
agriprocessors
in
which
nearly
400
employees
were
arrested
drew
attention
to
the
plight
of
undocumented
workers
and
helped
galvanize
supporters
of
immigration
reform
who
advocate
opening
america
to
more
legal
immigrants
and
to
finding
ways
to
legalize
undocumented
workers
who
are
already
here
at
a
september

immigration
summit
in
columbus
ohio
members
of
20
different
faiths
from
throughout
the
region
discussed
ways
that
communities
can
mobilize
to
push
forward
immigration
reform
by
strengthening
ties
with
immigrant
workers
and
by
training
leaders
of
faith
groups
in
advocacy
the
hebrew
immigrant
aid
societys
president
and
ceo
gideon
aronoff
who
attended
the
interfaith
gathering
said
that
the
appeal
to
grassroots
support
developed
after
congress
failed
to
pass
immigration
reform
proreform
groups
were
strong
but
not
organized
well
enough
our
greatest
lesson
was
that
we
need
to
expand
and
deepen
our
outreach
aronoff
said
hias
would
like
to
begin
to
move
beyond
washington
advocacy
to
grassroots
operations
after
the
postville
raid
hias
received
requests
from
local
communities
across
the
nation
to
arrange
meetings
and
discussions
on
immigration
agriprocessors
was
a
clarion
call
for
the
jewish
community
aronoff
said
an
issue
that
we
are
used
to
thinking
about
in
the
philosophical
level
suddenly
actually
hit
us
where
we
eat
the
significance
of
immigration
issues
was
echoed
by
many
jewish
groups
that
were
active
in
the
failed
2008
attempt
to
persuade
congress
to
adopt
immigration
reform
legislation
now
these
groups
feel
reinvigorated
the
union
for
reform
judaism
adopted
a
resolution
september
15
expressing
dismay
at
the
way
undocumented
workers
were
treated
during
the
postville
raid
rabbi
marla
feldman
director
of
the
commission
on
social
action
of
reform
judaism
said
that
the
postville
events
underscored
the
need
for
a
change
of
policy
the
current
immigration
system
creates
an
underground
network
of
immigrants
and
prevents
them
from
defending
themselves
against
abuse
and
from
stepping
out
of
the
shadows
feldman
said
also
flexing
their
muscles
are
some
conservative
radio
talkshow
hosts
who
oppose
liberal
immigration
policies
and
have
joined
an
organization
called
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
when
fair
lobbied
on
capitol

on
september
11
and
12
radio
professionals
gathered
in
one
long
hall
and
broadcast
their
shows
from
there
the
most
wellknown
member
of
fair
is
cnns
lou
dobbs
anchor
and
managing
editor
of
lou
dobbs
tonight
dobbs
sometimes
devotes
much
of
his
show
to
fighting
free
immigration
and
opposing
the
idea
of
blanket
amnesty
for
undocumented
workers
we
wanted
to
let
congress
know
that
immigration
is
still
an
important
issue
for
many
citizens
across
the
nation
said
fairs
national
media
director
ira
mehlman
fairs
work
was
criticized
by
the
antidefamation
league
which
has
been
tracking
the
work
of
antiimmigration
organizations
the
adl
argues
that
despite
fairs
statements
that
it
wants
to
solve
problems
of
illegal
immigration
fair
is
using
stereotypes
of
immigrants
to
fight
open
immigration
they
basically
oppose
the
entry
of
latinos
to
this
country
said
marilyn
mayo
codirector
of
the
adls
center
on
extremism
she
says
that
while
fair
is
not
among
the
extreme
antiimmigration
groups
its
ties
with
lawmakers
are
worrisome
we
are
concerned
that
the
rhetoric
of
groups
like
fair
will
seep
into
the
mainstream
discussion
mayo
added
mehlman
said
that
jewish
groups
such
as
the
adl
are
disconnected
from
what
ordinary
jewish
people
are
feeling
american
jews
see
these
issues
on
a
daily
basis
its
their
tax
dollars
that
have
to
pay
for
the
illegal
immigrants
and
their
health
insurance
premiums
that
increase
in
order
to
cover
the
uninsured
mehlman
said
on
september
17
in
new
york
aronoff
joined
several
other
religious
leaders
immigration
activists
and
trade
union
officials
for
a

marking
the
end
of
the
