conservative
republican
legislators
said
monday
they
would
try
again
next
year
we
need
to

moving
forward
not
just
sitting
back
said
state
rep
dan
flynn
rvan
at
a
meeting
of
the
texas
house
state
affairs
committee
several
republican
lawmakers
said
they
would
revive
state
immigration
enforcement
proposals
that
died
in
2007
but
immigration
lawyers
with
experience
in
el
pasoarea
lawsuits
said
enforcing
federal
immigration
laws
at
the
state
and
local
level
could
make
communities
more
dangerous
and
result
in
more
lawsuits
against
police
it
decreases
the
ability
of
police
to
fight
crime
and
protect
local
residents
said
david
urias
attorney
with
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
maldef
last
year
texas
lawmakers
filed
dozens
of
immigrationrelated
bills
among
other
things
the
proposals
would
have
required
local
officers
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
imposed
fees
on
money
wired
to
mexico
and
latin
america
and
eliminated
a
law
that
allows
undocumented
immigrants
to
pay
instate
tuition
rates
at
texas
universities
state
rep
leo
berman
rtyler
proposed
one
of
the
most
restrictive
anti
immigration
bills
it
would
have
eliminated
most
citizenship
rights
for
usborn
children
of
undocumented
immigrants
illegal
aliens
he
said
are
burdening
texas
public
schools
hospitals
and
prisons
berman
and
other
lawmakers
were
upset
that
lawmakers
did
not
pass
the
bills
last
year
berman
said
he
would
file
antiimmigration
bills
again
when
legislators
convene
in
2009
including
proposals
to
challenge
birthright
citizenship
to
punish
employers
who
hire
undocumented
workers
and
to
require
state
and
local
officers
to
enforce
immigration
laws
the
federal
government
can
never
resolve
this
problem
berman
said
we
here
in
texas
blew
our
opportunity
to
address
this
issue
and
protect
our
citizens
said
state
rep
debbie
riddle
rtomball
we
didnt
do
our
job
but
several
local
police
chiefs
including
former
el
paso
chief
richard
wiles
told
lawmakers
last
year
that
requiring
departments
to
take
on
federal
immigration
enforcement
would
be
unfair
expensive
and
counterproductive
maldef
attorney
urias
worked
on
a
recently
settled
lawsuit
against
the
otero
county
sheriff
involving
officers
who
allegedly
attempted
to
enforce
immigration
laws
when
local
officers
become
immigration
agents
he
said
immigrants
both
legal
and
illegal
hesitate
to
report
crimes
for
fear
that
their
friends
family
or
neighbors
could
be
deported
that
urias
said
makes
the
community
more
dangerous
for
everyone
because
officers
cannot
track
down
violent
criminals
effective
law
enforcement
in
any
community
requires
the
trust
and
cooperation
of
that
community
he
said
kathleen
walker
an
el
paso
immigration
lawyer
and
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
told
the
committee
they
should
tread
cautiously
when
approaching
complex
immigration
law
after
the
el
paso
county
sheriffs
office
settled
a
civil
rights
lawsuit
over
its
use
of
checkpoints
that
some
believed
were
used
to
ask
for
immigration
documents
walker
provided
training
to
deputies
were
talking
constitutional
principles
today
and
the
preservation
of
those
principles
she
said
we
have
to
be
cautious
how
we
treat
foreign
nationals
in
this
country
