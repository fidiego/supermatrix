the
rumblings
in
respect
of
the
immigration
issue
are
getting
so
loud
and
so
frequent
that
its
going
to
be
difficult
for
the
politicians
to
defer
action
for
much
longer
last
week
rep
steve
king
a
republican
of
iowa
who
is
a
member
of
the
judiciary
committees
subcommittee
on
immigration
stopped
by
our
office
to
among
other
things
call
for
what
he
described
as
a
selfish
immigration
policy
he
said
a
survey
of
his
constituents
found
97
of
them
wanted
to
eliminate
all
illegal
immigration
and
reduce
legal
immigration
mr
king
said
that
rep
thomas
tancredo
chairman
of
the
congressional
immigrationreform
caucus
has
been
in
iowa
laying
the
groundwork
for
a
potential
2008
presidential
run
focused
on
immigration
mr
tancredo
has
offered
legislation
that
calls
for
deploying
the
army
and
the
air
force
to
keep
immigrants
from
crossing
the
border
into
america
illegally
another
recent
visitor
to
the
new
york
sun
the
new
consul
general
of
ireland
in
new
york
timothy
oconnor
mentioned
that
the
irish
government
is
supportive
of
the
mccainkennedy
bill
that
would
help
immigrants
already
in
america
illegally
but
its
not
just
visitors
to
our
editorial
rooms
that
are
abuzz
over
the
immigration
the
columnist
cal
thomas
wrote
last
week
that
president
bush
should
use
the
paris
riots
as
an
occasion
for
an
immigration
crackdown
in
america
mr
thomas
approvingly
quoted
a
longtime
conservative
activist
paul
weyrich
as
saying
as
conservatives
we
need
to
make
it
clear
that
we
will
not
vote
for
any
candidate
who
refuses
to
close
our
borders
to
illegal
immigration
and
cut
back
on
legal
immigration
at
least
until
we
can
acculturate
the
immigrants
we
already
have
saturday
the
manhattan
institutes
tamar
jacoby
weighed
in
with
an
article
in
the
wall
street
journal
warning
against
an
effort
brewing
by
congressional
republicans
to
end
the
american
practice
of
granting
citizenship
automatically
to
those
born
in
this
country
even
if
their
parents
are
here
illegally
the
american
prospect
a
leftwing
magazine
mean
while
is
out
with
a
dispatch
in
its
november
issue
headlined
the
new
nativism
the
alarming
overlap
between
white
nationalists
and
mainstream
antiimmigrant
forces
los
angeles
times
yesterday
reported
that
business
groups
are
worried
by
the
bush
administrations
increasingly
tough
talk
on
illegal
immigration
which
goes
as
far
as
calling
december
border
security
month
all
of
this
can
be
healthy
if
it
gives
the
estimated
11
million
illegal
immigrants
in
america
a
way
out
of
the
shadows
having
immigration
laws
that
are
widely
disregarded
erodes
the
rule
of
law
and
poses
a
security
threat
but
if
congress
or
the
administration
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
without
also
sharply
increasing
the
levels
of
legal
immigration
theyd
be
making
a
mistake
it
wouldnt
just
be
political
suicide
in
a
nation
of
immigrants
in
which
republicans
are
on
the
verge
of
making
historic
inroads
with
hispanic
voters
it
would
be
betrayal
of
americas
purpose
and
history
as
a
refuge
for
those
around
the
world
seeking
political
religious
and
economic
freedom
it
would
be
a
protectionist
mistake
for
an
economy
that
is
in
need
of
more
labor
to
help
create
growth
illegal
immigration
after
all
is
a
sign
that
the
levels
of
legal
immigration
are
set
too
low
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
labor
market
we
share
the
national
security
concerns
that
are
being
voiced
by
opponents
of
completely
open
borders
were
for
open
borders
in
theory
but
recognize
the
problems
that
arise
in
the
kind
of
war
we
are
fighting
against
a
foe
that
has
already
abused
our
immigration
laws
to
deploy
a
fifth
column
on
our
campuses
and
in
our
towns
and
cities
but
america
has
nothing
to
fear
from
legal
immigration
even
at
significantly
higher
levels
immigration
has
historically
been
a
source
of
american
strength
thats
a
point
that
even
the
most
xenophobic
policymakers
may
find
themselves
reminded
of
this
week
as
they
gather
to
feast
on
the
bounty
of
our
land
and
to
give
thanks
to
god
in
a
tradition
that
was
started
by
the
religious
pilgrims
who
took
the
first
steps
toward
the
creation
of
the
idea
of
america
