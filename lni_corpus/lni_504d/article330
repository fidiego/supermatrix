when
immigrants
in
this
farming
community
need
help
securing
green
cards
work
permits
or
citizenship
they
go
to
a
woman
known
simply
as
gladys
gladys
jimenez
has
served
thousands
of
immigrants
since
she
opened
her
immigration
consulting
business
nine
years
ago
on
a
crowded
strip
alongside
taquerias
and
99cent
stores
but
hundreds
of
her
clients
now
face
possible
deportation
after
federal
immigration
officials
concluded
that
paperwork
filed
on
their
behalf
by
gladys
immigration
service
may
be
fraudulent
in
some
cases
applications
for
work
permits
apparently
claim
immigrants
lived
in
the
united
states
when
they
did
not
working
for
a
farm
thats
existence
cannot
be
verified
separately
the
monterey
county
district
attorneys
office
has
begun
an
inquiry
into
her
business
allegations
of
fraud
against
consultants
such
as
jimenez
are
common
in
california
where
breakneck
immigration
has
created
a
great
demand
for
help
in
navigating
a
bureaucracy
that
holds
the
keys
to
citizenship
by
law
consultants
can
do
no
more
than
help
clients
fill
out
paperwork
but
experts
say
spotty
enforcement
and
a
lack
of
regulation
leaves
the
door
open
for
unscrupulous
consultants
to
prey
on
undocumented
immigrants
charging
them
high
fees
for
fraudulent
services
that
can
lead
to
deportation
even
when
the
immigrants
have
a
legitimate
chance
to
obtain
legal
residency
the
state
provided
no
special
means
for
enforcement
when
in
1986
it
enacted
laws
intended
to
protect
people
from
predatory
consultants
and
a
mercury
news
investigation
found
that
few
county
district
attorneys
offices
investigate
consultants
or
regularly
prosecute
immigration
fraud
cases
moreover
federal
immigration
officials
in
california
who
suspect
fraud
generally
leave
it
to
the
state
to
enforce
its
laws
i
would
estimate
that
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
people
ripped
off
every
year
by
this
sort
of
fraudulent
activity
state
attorney
general
bill
lockyer
told
the
mercury
news
his
office
has
filed
several
civil
lawsuits
against
consultants
in
bay
area
counties
where
district
attorneys
do
not
regularly
investigate
violations
in
many
ways
jimenez
seems
better
than
most
in
the
business
she
meets
californias
basic
legal
requirements
regarding
immigration
consultants
she
has
registered
a
statemandated
50000
bond
posted
a
sign
in
her
office
stating
she
is
not
an
attorney
and
does
not
appear
to
advertise
as
a
notario
a
spanish
term
that
often
means
attorney
jimenez
denies
doing
anything
illegal
a
former
undocumented
immigrant
who
once
worked
as
a
restaurant
dishwasher
she
says
she
tries
to
help
people
who
come
to
the
united
states
as
she
did
seeking
a
better
life
its
a
desperate
feeling
she
said
of
being
undocumented
its
like
living
in
limbo
jimenez
started
her
business
after
borrowing
books
about
immigration
law
and
working
as
a
consultant
at
a
friends
incometax
office
her
clients
many
of
them
farmworkers
trickle
into
her
east
alisal
street
storefront
six
days
a
week
from
9
am
to
630
pm
often
carrying
documents
bundled
in
worn
plastic
grocery
bags
they
grab
ticket
numbers
and
sit
in
one
of
the
23
chairs
in
the
lobby
although
jimenez
employs
three
assistants
some
immigrants
will
wait
more
than
an
hour
to
speak
directly
with
her
in
salinas
where
almost
twothirds
of
the
151000
residents
are
latino
jimenez
is
wellknown
the
only
consultant
people
think
of
in
a
city
without
an
immigration
attorney
the
way
i
see
it
shes
someone
who
helps
the
community
said
anallamas
34
who
recently
traveled
more
than
an
hour
from
her
home
in
los
banos
to
meet
with
jimenez
but
over
the
past
year
some
of
those
helped
by
jimenez
have
received
letters
from
federal
immigration
officials
stating
that
documents
she
submitted
for
them
appear
to
have
been
falsified
jimenez
meanwhile
has
been
repeatedly
accused
by
attorneys
and
immigrants
of
providing
legal
advice
which
is
not
allowed
under
state
law
but
is
difficult
to
track
theyve
forwarded
complaints
to
authorities
and
wonder
why
shes
still
in
business
trying
to
keep
up
laws
enforcement
fail
to
curb
abuse
state
legislation
enacted
in
1986
lawenforcement
officials
agree
has
done
little
to
curb
the
abuse
by
unqualified
or
corrupt
consultants
the
centerpiece
of
those
laws
the
bond
requirement
was
designed
to
drive
off
flybynight
consultants
and
provide
fraud
victims
a
route
to
recourse
not
to
regulate
the
industry
lawmakers
have
taken
small
steps
to
update
californias
laws
as
immigration
fraud
increased
after
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
which
granted
some
27
million
undocumented
immigrants
amnesty
nationwide
the
amnesty
was
a
boon
to
new
consultants
seeking
to
help
the
larger
pool
of
immigrants
and
later
their
relatives
apply
for
legal
residency
in
increments
over
several
years
the
bond
amount
rose
from
10000
to
50000
but
the
state
has
no
record
of
how
often
if
ever
bond
companies
have
had
to
pay
out
a
bond
as
a
result
of
fraud
as
of
this
month
391
consultants
in
california
are
considered
in
good
standing
by
the
secretary
of
states
office
because
they
have
posted
bonds
according
to
state
documents
but
the
department
functions
merely
as
a
record
holder
with
no
authority
to
monitor
or
control
the
industry
a
mercury
news
review
of
those
documents
found
that
for
unexplained
reasons
the
state
has
no
record
of
bond
filings
before
1995
underscoring
the
scant
oversight
of
a
system
some
lawenforcement
officials
would
like
to
see
changed
moreover
the
review
found
that
only
60
consultants
have
posted
bonds
in
six
area
counties
santa
clara
san
mateo
san
francisco
alameda
santa
cruz
and
monterey
but
at
least
twice
that
number
advertise
in
the
yellow
pages
as
immigration
consultants
in
those
counties
far
more
build
their
businesses
by
placing
ads
in
ethnic
publications
and
like
jimenez
by
wordofmouth
referrals
among
immigrants
who
share
a
language
and
culture
such
referrals
were
the
root
of
one
highprofile
bay
area
case
where
up
to
275
korean
immigrants
caught
in
a
greencard
scam
now
face
possible
deportation
the
immigrants
applied
for
the
green
cards
more
than
a
decade
ago
with
the
help
of
four
immigration
consultants
they
met
through
a
cupertino
church
who
then
bribed
a
federal
immigration
official
in
return
for
the
documents
the
employee
and
consultants
none
of
whom
were
bonded
were
convicted
of
fraud
in
federal
court
bonded
or
not
consultants
are
rarely
on
the
radar
screens
of
district
attorneys
who
say
they
seldom
investigate
immigration
fraud
because
their
offices
are
underfunded
and
overworked
the
santa
clara
county
district
attorneys
office
is
unusual
for
having
prosecuted
15
cases
of
immigration
fraud
that
resulted
in
three
convictions
over
the
past
two
years
few
other
counties
keep
track
of
the
number
of
consultants
if
any
they
investigate
in
agricultural
kern
county
which
includes
bakersfield
prosecutors
havent
investigated
a
case
in
at
least
14
years
it
doesnt
mean
its
not
going
on
its
just
that
its
not
being
reported
said
kern
county
deputy
district
attorney
michael
yraceburn
in
the
case
of
jimenez
many
of
her
alleged
victims
are
reluctant
to
contact
authorities
because
they
are
living
in
the
united
states
illegally
even
those
who
say
they
can
prove
theyve
been
wronged
by
jimenez
will
instead
enlist
the
help
of
nonprofit
immigrantrights
organizations
to
straighten
out
their
legal
problems
just
today
i
had
three
people
here
who
had
problems
with
gladys
jorge
sifuentes
an
immigration
specialist
with
catholic
charities
in
salinas
said
recently
prosecutors
say
there
are
several
obstacles
in
addition
to
winning
the
trust
of
victims
to
fighting
fraud
by
immigration
consultants
some
forexample
grapple
with
cracking
down
on
unscrupulous
consultants
while
not
appearing
to
support
illegal
immigration
said
trevor
white
an
alameda
county
deputy
district
attorney
others
concede
investigating
consultants
is
low
on
the
priority
list
particularly
in
tough
economic
times
lets
put
the
cards
on
the
table
said
chuck
finney
a
consumerprotection
prosecutor
in
san
mateo
county
which
has
investigated
two
cases
of
immigration
fraud
in
the
past
two
years
theres
only
so
much
you
can
do
in
a
day
the
burgeoning
business
and
the
fraud
that
follows
has
increased
throughout
the
united
states
and
spread
to
areas
experiencing
an
unprecedented
influx
of
immigrants
ive
heard
from
people
in
new
york
in
maryland
north
carolina
all
over
the
past
year
or
so
said
nora
privitera
a
lawyer
with
immigrant
legal
resource
center
in
san
francisco
a
nonprofit
organization
that
sponsors
national
seminars
to
raise
awareness
about
shoddy
consultants
rural
areas
such
as
the
salinas
valley
are
particularly
ripe
for
such
fraud
immigration
attorneys
and
advocates
say
because
they
are
popular
destinations
for
newly
arrived
undocumented
immigrants
and
prosecutors
tend
to
be
less
informed
about
laws
regulating
consultants
searching
for
help
reputation
leads
worker
to
woman
among
the
many
immigrants
who
have
hired
jimenez
over
the
years
is
a
32yearold
farmworker
who
recently
learned
he
could
be
deported
because
of
her
assistance
the
man
who
left
his
hometown
in
michoacan
mexico
at
age
19
spoke
to
the
mercury
news
about
his
experience
on
the
condition
he
not
be
named
the
farmworker
qualifies
for
a
green
card
because
his
father
is
a
us
resident
but
because
he
turned
21
while
waiting
for
his
application
to
be
processed
he
was
bumped
down
the
us
state
departments
waiting
list
that
meant
he
would
have
to
wait
at
least
10
more
years
before
becoming
a
legal
resident
he
met
jimenez
in
1996
after
hearing
coworkers
rave
about
her
assistance
he
wanted
to
know
if
she
could
expedite
his
green
card
already
having
waited
four
years
i
told
her
that
i
had
received
my
acceptance
document
for
permanent
residency
and
wanted
to
know
what
she
could
do
for
me
while
i
waited
said
the
farmworker
who
now
lives
in
salinas
while
jimenez
couldnt
speed
up
the
process
he
said
that
for
350
she
proposed
another
solution
he
could
apply
for
a
work
permit
while
he
waited
for
his
green
card
to
process
the
application
jimenez
needed
evidence
that
he
was
in
the
country
since
1988
the
cutoff
year
for
the
socalled
family
unity
immigration
program
he
told
her
he
arrived
in
1990
dont
worry
he
said
he
remembers
jimenez
saying
he
said
she
then
urged
him
to
find
any
documentation
dating
to
1988
even
an
old
bus
transfer
he
could
find
nothing
earlier
than
his
pay
stubs
as
a
farmworker
dating
to
1990
but
he
said
that
for
another
100
jimenez
assured
him
a
work
permit
the
farmworker
who
has
a
sixthgrade
education
and
speaks
little
english
says
he
didnt
understand
the
details
of
the
form
he
was
signing
which
is
only
available
in
english
in
fact
he
was
not
eligible
for
the
permit
under
the
family
unity
program
and
couldnt
legally
work
while
waiting
for
his
green
card
which
he
says
he
didnt
realize
until
last
year
a
lawyer
for
jimenez
dana
mendelson
said
she
suspects
the
farmworker
had
to
have
known
what
he
was
signing
jimenez
says
she
has
never
skirted
laws
for
people
who
otherwise
do
not
qualify
for
benefits
asked
why
she
advertises
work
permits
which
are
relevant
only
to
a
small
group
of
qualified
immigrants
she
said
that
doesnt
mean
we
will
get
work
permits
with
that
sign
i
am
referring
to
the
renewal
of
work
permits
jimenez
said
recently
in
a
telephone
interview
from
her
native
peru
where
she
said
she
was
visiting
to
relieve
stress
we
can
help
fill
out
forms
for
a
work
permit
and
all
a
person
has
to
do
is
put
it
in
the
mail
within
six
months
of
submitting
his
application
the
farmworker
said
he
received
his
work
permit
from
the
nowdefunct
immigration
and
naturalization
service
jimenez
he
said
also
helped
him
secure
subsequent
renewals
papers
questioned
federal
office
finds
holes
in
applications
but
last
year
while
awaiting
a
fourth
renewal
he
received
a
letter
from
the
ins
california
service
center
in
laguna
niguel
stating
he
was
ineligible
to
work
the
letter
dated
sept
26
2002
said
he
failed
to
sufficiently
account
for
his
presence
in
the
united
states
in
1988
and
1989
he
wasnt
alone
after
a
review
of
several
hundred
applications
prepared
and
notarized
by
gladys
jimenez
the
service
has
found
an
unusually
high
number
of
documents
that
appear
to
be
duplicates
in
style
and
content
the
letter
read
therefore
the
service
questions
the
authenticity
and
veracity
of
the
documents
submitted
to
substantiate
your
employment
with
felix
farms
from
april
1988
to
july
15
1991
the
farmworker
was
outraged
he
had
never
worked
at
a
felix
farms
never
heard
of
it
i
panicked
he
said
because
i
knew
i
could
be
deported
an
immigration
attorney
he
consulted
vilma
guerrero
of
santa
cruz
suspects
jimenez
somehow
obtained
falsified
pay
stubs
she
and
other
attorneys
along
with
legal
experts
from
nonprofit
immigration
help
centers
who
are
representing
former
jimenez
clients
say
theyve
seen
dozens
of
similar
letters
most
of
the
time
she
takes
uneducated
people
who
are
very
vulnerable
said
sifuentes
the
immigration
specialist
with
catholic
charities
of
jimenez
a
mercury
news
search
of
business
records
in
salinas
and
unincorporated
monterey
county
where
the
vast
majority
of
agricultural
work
takes
place
found
no
existence
of
a
felix
farms
a
search
of
statewide
records
also
came
up
empty
an
address
for
felix
farms
wasnt
listed
in
the
farmworkers
letter
you
are
altering
my
information
for
immigration
purposes
and
this
could
jeopardize
my
case
the
farmworker
said
he
told
jimenez
he
demanded
that
she
contact
immigration
officials
to
explain
how
she
obtained
proof
of
his
residence
before
1990
he
then
contacted
sifuentes
who
warned
the
farmworker
that
he
could
be
in
danger
of
deportation
because
he
signed
for
the
work
permit
application
under
penalty
of
perjury
sifuentes
referred
the
farmworker
to
guerrero
several
attorneys
had
previously
complained
to
lawenforcement
officials
about
jimenez
and
other
consultants
but
got
nowhere
weve
tried
to
get
the
state
agencies
state
attorney
general
district
attorneys
offices
to
use
their
enforcement
power
to
clean
up
some
of
this
and
so
far
there
hasnt
been
much
movement
on
that
front
said
michael
meuter
a
supervising
attorney
with
the
california
legal
rural
assistance
office
in
salinas
lawyers
at
the
nonprofit
watsonville
law
center
have
helped
former
jimenez
clients
fill
out
consumer
complaint
forms
that
were
forwarded
to
the
monterey
county
district
attorneys
office
over
the
past
year
the
district
attorneys
office
declined
to
comment
about
jimenez
and
wouldnt
say
whether
she
was
under
criminal
investigation
frustrated
immigration
attorneys
and
other
immigration
service
providers
in
santa
cruz
and
monterey
counties
last
year
formed
a
task
force
in
part
to
educate
prosecutors
and
the
public
about
fraudulent
immigration
consultants
jimenez
remains
largely
the
focus
the
group
enlisted
rep
sam
farr
dsalinas
who
had
become
aware
of
jimenez
through
three
staff
members
who
handle
immigration
matters
farr
shares
the
frustration
of
those
who
wish
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
would
crack
down
on
consultants
its
probably
the
fault
of
all
these
government
agencies
for
not
doing
their
job
said
farr
whose
office
coordinates
the
central
coast
immigration
task
force
state
laws
have
to
be
changed
when
to
probe
different
jurisdictions
have
different
standards
farr
and
other
taskforce
members
are
astounded
that
the
bureau
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
and
its
predecessor
the
ins
noticed
a
questionable
pattern
in
jimenezs
work
but
apparently
instead
chose
to
target
her
clients
immigration
officials
say
theres
good
reason
and
it
has
to
do
with
federal
regulations
while
jimenez
meets
the
requirements
to
be
a
consultant
in
california
she
doesnt
belong
to
a
more
exclusive
network
of
immigration
service
providers
who
are
recognized
by
the
federal
agency
those
who
are
recognized
as
accredited
representatives
by
the
us
board
of
immigration
appeals
can
act
as
consultants
as
well
as
represent
clients
at
immigration

were

center
in

the

flagged
her
paperwork
neufeld

wouldnt
specify
how
jimenez
came
to
the

attention
but
a
former
aide
to
farr
yvette
agredano
who
was
trained
in
immigration
matters
by
ins
officials
in
the
late
1990s
said
the
agency
first
knew
about
questionable
applications
from
gladys
immigration
service
in
1998
agredano
said
ins
employees
told
her
they
had
redflagged
questionable
documents
from
jimenez
but
could
do
nothing
because
federal
laws
apparently
had
not
been
violated
a
mechanism
needs
to
be
established
to
secure
collaboration
among
the

fraud
through

neufeld
said
immigration
officials
in
his
southern
california
processing
center
can
investigate
a
case
if
they
suspect
fraud
they
also
generally
provide
the
information
to
a
local
immigration
office
or
an
appropriate
state
agency
for
further
action
even
if
the
consultant
is
unaccredited
i
couldnt
tell
you
what
we
did
specifically
in
that
case
he
said
of
jimenez
we
dont
comment
on
cases
that
may
or
may
not
be
under
investigation
he
referred
further
questions
to
the
san
jose
district
immigration
office
which
includes
salinas
bay
area
spokeswoman
sharon
rummery
declined
to
say
what
investigators
knew
about
jimenez
jimenez
says
she
draws
a
line
between
whats
legal
in
the
immigration
business
and
whats
not
when
cases
require
legal
advice
she
said
she
refers
clients
to
a
private
attorney
we
can
never
tell
a
client
if
they
will
qualify
for
something
jimenez
said
that
would
be
against
the
law
jimenez
said
she
received
a
letter
a
few
months
ago
from
the
monterey
county
district
attorneys
office
asking
her
to
disclose
details
about
how
she
operates
she
suspects
prosecutors
are
investigating
her
because
other
salinas
consultants
could
have
complained
envious
of
the
dozens
of
clients
that
seek
her
assistance
every
week
as
long
as
ones
conscience
is
clean
jimenez
said
one
has
to
keep
working
she
hopes
to
open
a
second
location
warning
signs
some
immigration
consultants
will
make
exaggerated
claims
to
lure
clients
who
are
desperate
for
help
