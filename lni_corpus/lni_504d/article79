illegal
immigration
and
enforcement
have
been
the
dominant
concerns
driving
immigration
policy
for
more
than
25
years
deep
public
skepticism
over
the
federal
governments
will
and
ability
to
enforce
the
nations
immigration
laws
has
come
with
them
as
a
result
enforcement
first
a
proposition
that
argued
for
effective
enforcement
as
a
precondition
to
broader
reforms
became
widely
embraced
in
a
report
released
monday
the
migration
policy
institute
documents
how
dramatically
facts
have
changed
from
those
longheld
perceptions
particularly
since
sept
11
2001
but
dating
to
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
irca
which
attempted
to
end
illegal
immigration
through
employer
sanctions
increased
border
enforcement
and
legalization
the
nation
has
made
unprecedented
steep
investments
in
the
capacity
of
federal
agencies
to
aggressively
enforce
immigration
laws
since
the
1986
legislation
was
enacted
nearly
187
billion
has
been
spent
on
immigration
enforcement
budgets
for
the
two
main
federal
enforcement
agencies
us
customs
and
border
protection
cbp
and
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
and
its
primary
enforcement
technology
initiative
the
us
visitor
and
immigrant
status
indicator
technology
usvisit
program
are
nearly
15
times
what
was
spent
to
operate
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
1986
today
the
federal
government
spends
more
on
its
immigration
enforcement
agencies
than
on
all
its
other
principal
criminal
law
enforcement
agencies
combined
spending
for
customs
and
border
protection
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
and
usvisit
reached
nearly
18
billion
in
fiscal
2012
contrast
that
with
the
144
billion
spent
for
the
fbi
drug
enforcement
administration
secret
service
us
marshals
service
and
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
such
spending
which
reflects
a
strong
proenforcement
consensus
in
congress
has
built
a
muscular
complex
crossagency
system
it
extends
beyond
us
borders
to
screen
visitors
against
multiple
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
databases
before
they
arrive
in
the
united
states
it
also
reaches
into
communities
across
the
country
through
information
sharing
interoperable
databases
and
partnerships
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
the
system
that
has
emerged
is
generating
record
levels
of
enforcement
results
l
customs
and
border
protection
and
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
refer
more
cases
for
federal
prosecution
than
all
the
justice
department
law
enforcement
agencies
combined
including
the
fbi
dea
and
atf
l
a
significantly
larger
number
of
individuals
are
detained
each
year
in
the
immigration
detention
system
just
under
430000
in
fiscal
2011
than
are
serving
sentences
in
federal
bureau
of
prisons
facilities
for
all
other
federal
crimes
l
more
than
4
million
noncitizens
primarily
unauthorized
immigrants
have
been
deported
from
the
united
states
since
1990
with
removals
rising
from
30039
in
fiscal
1990
to
a
record
409849
in
fiscal
2012
l
imperatives
for
border
control
have
led
to
record
highs
in
border
patrol
staffing
technology
and
infrastructure
at
the
same
time
apprehensions
have
fallen
to
40year
lows
340252
in
2011
down
from
more
than
16
million
in
fiscal
2000
after
the
1986
reforms
growth
of
the
resident
unauthorized
population
resumed
and
increased
to
levels
of
about
525000
annually
but
that
began
to
change
in
2007
and
there
has
been
a
negative
flow
since
the
shift
primarily
stems
from
reduced
job
demand
in
a
recession
economy
and
changing
conditions
in
mexico
but
it
also
reflects
the
buildup
of
enforcement
capacities
together
they
have
led
to
a
fundamental
reset
in
the
calculus
of
illegal
migration
the
nation
has
built
a
formidable
immigration
enforcement
machinery
judging
by
resource
levels
case
volumes
and
enforcement
actions
immigration
enforcement
ranks
as
the
federal
governments
highest
criminal
law
enforcement
priority
enforcement
first
has
become
the
nations
de
facto
response
to
illegal
immigration
changes
to
the
immigration
system
have
focused
almost
entirely
on
building
enforcement
programs
and
improving
their
performance
gaps
in
enforcement
such
as
employer
accountability
remain
to
be
addressed
but
building
an
everlarger
enforcement
bulwark
is
hard
to
justify
in
an
era
of
fiscal
restraint
and
one
in
which
illegal
immigration
has
abated
because
of
factors
that
include
strengthened
enforcement
and
immense
resource
infusions
even
with
recordsetting
expenditures
and
the
full
use
of
a
wide
array
of
statutory
and
administrative
tools
enforcement
alone
no
matter
how
well
administered
is
an
insufficient
answer
to
the
broad
challenges
that
illegal
and
legal
immigration
pose
for
americas
future
changes
must
also
be
made
to
better
align
immigration
policy
with
the
nations
economic
and
labor
market
requirements
and
with
future
growth
and
wellbeing
the
enforcement
machinery
that
has
been
built
can
serve
the
national
interest
well
if
it
also
provides
a
platform
for
policy
changes
suited
to
the
larger
challenges
that
immigration
represents
for
the
united
states
in
the
21st
century
