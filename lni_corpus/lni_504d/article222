president
barack
obama
makes
his
first
official
trip
to
mexico
activists
are
intensifying
the
campaign
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
an
issue
they
fear
has
been
overshadowed
by
the
economic
slump
reform
leaders
say
they
were
relieved
by
recent
reports
that
obama
who
will
meet
today
with
mexican
president
felipe
calderon
plans
to
speak
publicly
about
the
issue
in
may
and
will
press
lawmakers
from
both
parties
to
begin
discussing
legislation
by
the
fall
we
know
that
good
will
and
promises
in
this
politically
charged
atmosphere
are
not
going
to
be
enough
said
juan
jose
gutierrez
spokesman
for
the
los
angelesbased
full
rights
for
immigrants
coalition
the
white
house
has
downplayed
reports
that
the
administration
would
push
for
immigration
reform
as
early
as
next
month
clarifying
that
while
the
issue
is
important
dealing
with
the
economic
crisis
is
the
top
priority
obama
has
said
he
supports
a
combination
of
enforcing
laws
and
opening
up
the
system
he
wants
to
see
a
path
for
citizenship
that
would
mean
requiring
an
illegal
immigrant
to
pay
a
fine
learn
english
and
then
get
in
line
for
citizenship
immigration
advocates
say
they
plan
to
continue
pressing
the
issue
with
activities
that
will
culminate
with
may
day
marches
and
rallies
planned
for
several
cities
immigration
reformers
also
used
the
holy
week
activities
to
distribute
thousands
of
postcards
preaddressed
to
obama
urging
immigration
legislation
parishioners
at
southern
california
churches
were
asked
to
sign
the
postcard
and
mail
them
to
the
white
house
at
a
news
conference
last
week
at
the
los
angeles
federal
building
immigration
activists
displayed
a
large
banner
showing
the
countdown
to
the
end
of
the
first
100
days
of
the
obama
presidency
the
time
frame
in
which
obama
promised
to
introduce
comprehensive
legislation
to
amend
current
laws
we
are
surprised
nothing
has
been
sent
to
congress
on
immigration
reform
because
the
president
was
very
explicit
in
saying
that
he
would
do
so
within
the
first
100
days
of
his
administration
gutierrez
said
in
an
interview
i
dont
have
a
phd
but
i
know
what
the
number
100
is
and
the
first
100
days
of
his
administration
ends
april
30
reform
efforts
also
got
a
boost
this
week
when
rival
labor
unions
the
aflcio
and
the
change
to
win
federation
agreed
to
join
forces
to
support
an
overhaul
of
the
immigration
system
la
watching
closely
immigration
reform
is
especially
sensitive
in
los
angeles
a
city
with
a
significant
number
of
the
12
million
illegal
immigrants
estimated
to
be
living
in
this
country
many
from
mexico
and
central
america
the
san
fernando
valley
alone
is
home
to
an
estimated
quartermillion
illegal
immigrants
according
to
immigrantrights
groups
the
us
census
does
not
distinguish
legal
from
illegal
residents
antiillegal
immigration
groups
have
also
been
gearing
up
their
own
campaign
warning
of
severe
consequences
for
us
workers
and
the
economy
if
amnesty
is
offered
to
illegal
immigrants
as
12
million
americans
look
for
jobs
the
pew
hispanic
center
has
estimated
that
77
million
us
jobs
are
currently
held
by
illegal
immigrants
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
has
noted
lawmakers
should
be
evaluating
how
us
immigration
policy
impacts
the
american
worker
not
parading
around
the
country
trying
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
mass
amnesty
said
dan
stein
president
of
fair
obama
skeptics
waiting
some
latino
studies
experts
say
the
concern
among
immigration
activists
that
the
new
president
has
held
back
on
legislative
reform
is
wellfounded
we
had
reason
to
believe
and
hope
that
obama
was
serious
when
he
promised
immigration
reform
early
in
his
administration
said
jorge
garcia
a
chicano
studies
professor
at
california
state
university
northridge
but
he
has
so
many
other
things
to
deal
with
that
it
seems
that
immigration
has
gotten
lost
in
the
shuffle
while
in
southern
california
last
month
obama
renewed
his
support
for
comprehensive
reform
including
a
possible
path
to
citizenship
for
otherwise
lawabiding
immigrants
who
entered
the
country
illegally
along
the
lines
of
the
bill
that
stalled
in
congress
in
2007
but
a
fight
over
immigration
reform
say
political
experts
could
be
difficult
for
the
president
and
democrats
and
could
become
a
rallying
point
for
republicans
to
mobilize
political
outrage
against
any
effort
to
protect
illegal
immigrant
workers
while
so
many
americans
are
out
of
work
there
never
will
be
a
good
time
for
immigration
reform
and
for
obama
there
could
be
a
better
time
and
he
wanted
to
make
it
a
secondyear
issue
said
jaime
regalado
director
of
the
edmund
g
pat
brown
institute
of
public
affairs
at
california
state
university
los
angeles
and
a
close
observer
of
latino
politics
immigration
reformers
agree
but
are
mindful
that
hispanics
gave
obama
67
percent
of
their
votes
last
year
we
helped
put
president
obama
in
the
white
house
said
sergio
aguirre
president
of
the
immigrant
rights
group
council
of
mexican
federations
and
now
we
expect
his
support
on
immigration
reform
