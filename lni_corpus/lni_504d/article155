i
was
disappointed
in
president
obamas
challenge
to
arizonas
hotly
debated
immigration
law
and
judge
susan
boltons
preliminary
ruling
to
argue
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
local
law
enforcement
to
be
a
legitimate
partner
in
immigration
enforcement
is
shortsighted
it
is
evidence
of
a
lack
of
commitment
to
securing
our
borders
and
a
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
proper
role
of
the
states
in
supporting
federal
law
enforcement
priorities
the
administration
challenged
the
arizona
law
because
immigration
enforcement
is
the
province
of
the
federal
government
and
federal
law
trumps
state
law
while
i
agree
with
this
constitutional
principle
the
federal
government
has
not
exclusively
preempted
the
states
role
in
immigration
enforcement
in
fact
the
federal
government
has
encouraged
a
greater
partnership
with
the
state
and
it
should
continue
to
do
so
as
the
former
undersecretary
for
border
and
transportation
security
at
the
department
of
homeland
security
i
made
the
case
that
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
does
not
have
the
manpower
or
resources
to
do
the
job
alone
there
are
about
12
million
illegal
immigrants
in
the
country
and
only
about
6000
ice
agents
obviously
our
efforts
will
be
more
effective
if
we
can
partner
federal
law
enforcements
limited
resources
with
the
vaster
resources
of
state
and
local
organizations
around
the
country
this
is
why
we
promoted
something
known
as
287g
passed
by
congress
in
1996
as
part
of
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigrant
responsibility
act
in
short
287g
encourages
partnerships
between
federal
and
statelocal
law
enforcement
to
tackle
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
the
program
was
and
remains
quite
successful
though
the
current
administration
has
greatly
curtailed
the
approval
of
new
agreements
with
states
that
would
allow
for
such
partnerships
nonetheless
there
are
63
jurisdictions
in
20
states
including
arizona
that
already
have
partnership
agreements
with
ice
the
joint
agreements
require
that
ice
provide
training
including
training
to
protect
the
civil
rights
of
individuals
and
prevent
profiling
they
also
require
that
ice
agents
supervise
local
officers
when
they
are
engaged
in
immigration
enforcement
activity
to
suggest
that
immigration
is
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
federal
government
disallowing
partnerships
with
local
law
enforcement
defies
the
will
of
congress
not
to
mention
reality
numerous
local
jurisdictions
have
laws
on
the
books
dealing
with
immigration
in
a
variety
of
ways
historically
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
legitimate
police
powers
of
the
states
are
not
to
be
preempted
by
federal
law
unless
congress
has
made
that
purpose
clear
when
congress
has
been
an
active
partner
in
promoting
state
and
local
enforcement
partnerships
as
in
the
case
of
immigration
there
should
be
no
real
preemption
debate
clearly
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
is
not
being
addressed
to
the
extent
it
needs
to
be
addressed
in
arizona
when
gov
jan
brewer
signed
sb
1070
into
law
authorizing
the
states
local
law
enforcement
to
enforce
immigration
law
she
made
clear
that
the
state
of
arizona
was
doing
so
because
the
federal
government
had
failed
to
do
so
there
are
plenty
of
examples
of
federalstate
partnerships
that
deal
with
a
variety
of
law
enforcement
challenges
these
could
be
used
as
models
for
similar
partnerships
regarding
immigration
for
instance
joint
drug
enforcement
task
forces
comprising
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
combat
illicit
drugs
including
drugs
being
smuggled
across
us
borders
are
common
no
single
entity
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
the
enforcement
efforts
are
shared
another
model
is
the
joint
terrorism
task
forces
established
to
combat
terrorism
in
this
case
there
is
a
clear
lead
agency
the
fbi
however
as
the
department
of
justice
asserts
on
its
website
the
task
forces
comprise
the
resources
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
without
allowing
for
such
partnerships
between
states
and
the
federal
government
on
the
issue
of
immigration
there
can
be
no
serious
argument
that
we
are
attempting
to
secure
our
borders
to
be
sure
the
financial
burden
of
enforcement
should
not
fall
only
on
state
and
local
governments
rather
the
federal
government
should
provide
adequate
funding
to
support
local
efforts
and
it
has
a
costsharing
relationship
with
state
governments
already
is
in
place
known
as
operation
stone
garden
to
reimburse
them
for
the
borderenforcement
efforts
in
which
they
engage
certainly
i
appreciate
judge
boltons
concern
for
preserving
individual
liberty
something
our
courts
must
always
seek
to
uphold
proper
training
and
federal
supervision
in
statefederal
partnerships
are
essential
to
both
assuring
constitutional
rights
and
enforcing
our
immigration
laws
our
founding
fathers
concept
of
federalism
does
not
prohibit
such
cooperation
and
we
have
learned
from
experience
that
joint
efforts
work
best
