revised
bill
retains
immigration
checks
score
one
for
business
in
the
latest
round
of
debate
over
proposed
immigration
reform
in
the
florida
senate
a
committee
monday
relaxed
a
requirement
that
the
state
and
all
private
employers
check
the
immigration
status
of
any
prospective
employee
by
using
the
federal
governments
everify
system
the
condition
a
favorite
among
tea
party
types
who
supported
gov
rick
scott
faced
stiff
opposition
from
big
business
agricultural
interests
and
immigration
advocates
who
questioned
everifys
effectiveness
under
the
new
version
of
the
bill
sponsored
by
miami
republican
sen
anitere
flores
employers
would
be
able
to
bypass
everify
by
requiring
new
hires
to
present
identifying
documents
such
as
an
unexpired
us
passport
or
florida
drivers
license
which
are
not
issued
to
undocumented
workers
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
the
bill
one
of
several
arizonastyle
proposals
making
their
way
through
the
legislature
this
session
has
appeased
all
of
its
critics
they
fear
other
provisions
in
the
law
would
result
in
racial
profiling
by
law
enforcement
officers
empowered
to
enforce
federal
immigration
regulations
this
is
not
the
way
to
do
immigration
reform
said
susana
barciela
of
the
florida
immigrant
advocacy
center
she
spoke
at
a
rally
monday
held
by
a
broad
coalition
of
religious
and
immigration
leaders
outside
trinity
episcopal
church
in
miami
last
week
a
group
of
church
leaders
from
across
the
state
including
bishop
leo
frade
of
the
episcopal
diocese
of
southeast
florida
sent
a
letter
to
lawmakers
urging
them
to
reject
immigration
bills
immigration
advocates
and
other
opponents
including
the
american
civil
liberties
union
also
held
a
news
conference
and
testified
against
the
bill
monday
in
tallahassee
they
focused
their
criticism
on
asking
local
law
enforcement
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
arrest
a
practice
police
departments
in
most
large
urban
settings
have
rejected
because
it
deters
victims
or
witnesses
of
crime
from
coming
forward
another
immigration
bill
approved
by
a
house
committee
last
week
would
require
police
to
check
the
status
of
a
person
who
is
under
arrest
or
the
subject
of
a
criminal
investigation
polls
have
shown
tackling
illegal
immigration
is
popular
among
most
voters
except
hispanics
a
crucial
voting
bloc
in
florida
flores
senate
bill
would
require
all
sheriffs
and
police
departments
to
request
the
power
to
enforce
immigration
laws
from
the
federal
government
if
the
local
agencies
find
the
practice
feasible
to
implement
only
three
florida
counties
have
those
powers
now
bay
collier
and
duval
a
report
by
the
us
department
of
homeland
security
last
year
found
the
practice
riddled
with
problems
though
the
department
has
since
made
changes
to
its
rules
business
groups
opposition
centered
on
everify
which
federal
experts
have
warned
should
not
be
used
for
screening
job
seekers
because
the
system
was
not
created
for
that
purpose
tea
partiers
who
flocked
to
scott
when
he
campaigned
for
an
illegal
immigration
crackdown
during
last
years
gubernatorial
primary
strongly
favored
mandating
the
system
failure
to
pass
and
implement
mandatory
everify
will
cause
florida
to
become
a
magnet
for
illegals
selfdeporting
from
other
states
implementing
immigration
laws
like
georgia
said
julie
hood
a
board
member
of
the
tea
party
manatee
group
based
in
bradenton
the
bill
would
still
suspend
the
license
of
employers
not
checking
if
employees
are
legally
eligible
to
work
whether
they
use
everify
or
other
documents
flores
asked
for
the
revision
to
loosen
the
everify
requirement
at
a
senate
judiciary
committee
where
she
also
proposed
other
changes
among
them
was
tweaking
the
title
of
the
bill
from
one
dealing
with
unauthorized
aliens
to
unauthorized
immigrants
a
phrase
more
palatable
for
immigration
advocates
