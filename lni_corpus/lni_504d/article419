the
history
of
us
immigration
policy
sure
isnt
pretty
tied
as
it
is
to
surges
of
nativism
nationalism
and
racism
but
now
amid
reviving
anti
immigration
sentiment
congress
has
an
opportunity
to
snap
that
ignoble
link
the
latest
trend
is
small
but
nevertheless
telling
a
usa
todaycnngallup
poll
finds
that
65
say
the
united
states
should
admit
fewer
newcomers
55
believe
immigrant
diversity
threatens
american
culture
64
say
immigrants
hurt
the
economy
by
lowering
wages
despite
such
opinions
85
have
no
friends
or
relatives
who
are
recent
immigrants
81
admit
they
know
no
one
who
has
lost
a
job
to
an
immigrant
some
of
this
is
understandable
the
economy
is
uncertain
a
historic
trigger
of
antiimmigration
feeling
moreover
the
current
news
is
full
of
terrorist
plotters
and
boatloads
of
wouldbe
immigrants
trying
to
come
ashore
but
its
more
important
to
understand
that
this
nation
thrives
on
immigration
and
has
done
so
since
its
founding
our
slogan
isnt
e
pluribus
unum
one
out
of
many
for
nothing
predictably
though
political
will
follows
public
mood
that
means
that
now
as
in
the
past
antiimmigration
feelings
will
energize
antiimmigration
action
among
the
proposals
being
heard
to
shut
off
all
immigration
to
wall
off
the
mexican
border
to
deploy
the
military
against
the
flow
of
undocumented
immigrants
to
allow
border
guards
to
judge
asylum
claims
and
summarily
reject
the
unconvincing
ones
plainly
immigration
policy
needs
work
washingtons
asylum
laws
are
mostly
based
on
bad
ideas
and
impossible
ambitions
but
thats
no
reason
to
think
the
entire
process
is
valueless
indeed
when
emma
lazarus
wrote
give
me
your
tired
your
poor
she
was
stating
a
faith
in
diversity
that
is
one
of
this
nations
founding
principles
so
fix
immigration
policy
by
all
means
but
lets
be
careful
in
the
process
not
to
make
the
statue
of
liberty
a
liar
language
english
type
debate
the
editorial
page
todays
debate
is
on
immigration
and
what
direction
our
national
policy
should
take
our
view
immigration
reform
is
appropriate
the
natins
rising
antiimmigration
mood
is
not
