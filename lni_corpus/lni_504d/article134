states
are
passing
immigration
laws
even
laws
outside
the
scope
of
their
authority
because
federal
lawmakers
have
not
tackled
the
issue
according
to
a
panel
of
national
advocates
monday
leaders
from
groups
advocating
for
different
solutions

dan
stein
president
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
said
his
organization
has
had
a
hand
in
most
of
the
state
laws
for
decades
it
has
called
for
tighter
controls
on
the
flow
of
immigrants
into
the
us
and
coordination
of
all
government
agencies
to
track
immigrants
theres
a
need
to
have
a
partnership
with
the
executive
branch
to
carry
out
immigration
laws
stein
said
these
state
laws
are
about
trying
to
carve
out
terms
and
put
political
pressure
to
do
more
many
provisions
of
oklahomas
2007
house
bill
1804
law
regarding
immigration
enforcement
have
been
challenged
and
held
up
in
federal
appellate
court
the
one
part
going
into
effect
requires
employers
to
verify
immigration
status
an
arizona
law
passed
last
year
considered
the
toughest
and
most
restrictive
in
the
us
is
being
contested
in
federal
court
you
are
going
to
continue
to
see
citizens
and
state
legislators
saying
we
have
to
do
something
what
we
have
is
not
good
government
or
public
policy
stein
said
the
ultimate
solution
must
be
federal
cooperation
don
kerwin
of
the
migration
policy
institute
said
the
federal
government
is
deporting
more
than
400000
immigrants
a
year
and
growing
numbers
of
administrative
immigration
hearings
than
in
the
past
decade
its
overstating
it
to
say
the
federal
government
is
not
enforcing
the
laws
kerwin
said
it
is
not
legitimate
to
say
the
federal
government
cant
establish
priorities
but
with
the
state
laws
the
solution
is
worse
than
the
status
quo
that
is
why
we
need
federal
reform
awaiting
to
be
heard
by
the
oklahoma
house
is
house
bill
1446
a
wideranging
immigration
measure
that
would
give
law
enforcement
officers
authority
to
check
immigration
status
of
drivers
and
vehicle
occupants
during
a
traffic
stop
and
require
illegal
immigrant
students
in
college
to
pay
outofstate
tuition
stein
said
state
legislation
such
as
the
oklahoma
proposal
is
a
desperate
response
from
americans
to
the
complete
collapse
of
federal
leadership
in
immigration
enforcement
martinez
de
castro
said
the
immigration
debate
has
turned
negative
and
often
stereotypes
hispanic
people
she
said
seven
of
10
hispanic
people
in
the
us
are
legal
and
that
jumps
to
nine
out
of
10
among
those
younger
than
18
we
have
seen
the
equating
of
latinos
with
immigrants
with
undocumented
to
use
a
benign
term
she
said
jerry
kammer
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
said
about
1
million
immigrants
are
granted
residency
status
known
as
green
cards
a
year
he
said
it
was
onefourth
of
that
in
the
60s
and
half
of
that
in
the
80s
the
event
also
featured
a
discussion
between
two
lawmakers
on
opposite
sides
of
the
issue
sen
ralph
shortey
roklahoma
city
campaigned
on
strengthening
immigration
laws
in
oklahoma
and
penned
a
proposal
that
would
require
undocumented
students
to
pay
nonresident
tuition
rates
at
state
colleges
and
universities
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
make
these
people
realize
theyre
not
wanted
here
and
to
leave
our
state
shortey
said
my
native
american
heritage
prompts
me
to
protect
what
we
have
shortey
said
some
native
americans
he
speaks
to
as
well
as
other
constituents
see
they
are
losing
the
country
again
the
freshman
senator
added
he
feels
morally
obligated
to
uphold
and
protect
federal
immigration
laws
senate
minority
leader
andrew
rice
doklahoma
city
said
he
fears
proposals
such
as
shorteys
would
alienate
legal
immigrant
communities
and
push
illegal
immigrants
further
underground
this
will
affect
our
state
in
ways
we
wont
like
said
rice
who
used
an
example
of
phoenixs
declining
convention
business
because
of
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
that
went
into
effect
last
year
