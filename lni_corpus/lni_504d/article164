saying
the
constitution
and
federal
law
do
not
permit
the
development
of
a
patchwork
of
state
and
local
immigration
policies
the
department
of
justice
on
tuesday
sued
the
state
of
arizona
over
its
new
immigration
law
in
a
brief
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
of
arizona
justice
department
officials
said
arizonas
new
immigration
law
senate
bill
1017
unconstitutionally
interferes
with
the
federal
governments
authority
to
set
and
enforce
immigration
policy
a
patchwork
of
state
and
local
policies
would
seriously
disrupt
federal
immigration
enforcement
the
governments
brief
said
having
enacted
its
own
immigration
policy
that
conflicts
with
federal
immigration
law
arizona
crossed
a
constitutional
line
us
attorney
general
eric
holder
said
the
law
would
place
significant
burdens
on
federal
agencies
diverting
their
resources
away
from
highpriority
targets
such
as
aliens
implicated
in
terrorism
drug
smuggling
and
gang
activity
and
those
with
criminal
records
 
arizonans
are
understandably
frustrated
with
illegal
immigration
and
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
to
comprehensively
address
those
concerns
holder
said
but
diverting
federal
resources
away
from
dangerous
aliens
such
as
terrorism
suspects
and
aliens
with
criminal
records
will
impact
the
entire
countrys
safety
setting
immigration
policy
and
enforcing
immigration
laws
is
a
national
responsibility
 seeking
to
address
the
issue
through
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
will
only
create
more
problems
than
it
solves
court
documents
show
the
justice
department
has
also
requested
a
preliminary
injunction
to
prevent
enforcement
of
the
law
arguing
that
the
laws
operation
will
cause
irreparable
harm
arizona
impermissibly
seeks
to
regulate
immigration
by
creating
an
arizonaspecific
immigration
policy
that
is
expressly
designed
to
rival
or
supplant
that
of
the
federal
government
the
brief
noted
 as
such
arizonas
immigration
policy
exceeds
a
states
role
with
respect
to
aliens
interferes
with
the
federal
governments
balanced
administration
of
the
immigration
laws
and
critically
undermines
us
foreign
policy
objectives
senate
bill
1070
does
not
simply
seek
to
provide
legitimate
support
to
the
federal
governments
immigration
policy
but
instead
creates
an
unprecedented
independent
immigration
scheme
that
exceeds
constitutional
boundaries
legal
experts
said
the
lawsuit
was
a
significant
moment
in
immigrant
and
civil
rights
history
while
i
agree
with
the
majority
of
americans
that
we
must
have
sensible
and
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
addresses
both
border
security
and
relief
for
the
undocumented
the
arizona
law
is
the
manifestation
of
fears
fueled
by
hate
groups
and
failures
of
the
immigration
system
said
doug
stump
an
oklahoma
city
immigration
attorney
stump
said
the
lawsuit
was
necessary
to
protect
constitutional
principles
the
law
sanctions
racial
ethnic
and
immigrant
profiling
and
needs
to
be
challenged
by
a
greater
authority
and
only
the
federal
government
can
do
that
he
said
although
it
may
be
unpopular
to
some
the
lawsuit
had
to
be
filed
to
protect
the
fundamental
principles
of
our
constitution
the
lawsuit
he
said
also
could
spawn
additional
challenges
to
oklahomas
immigration
law
were
seeing
a
pattern
across
the
state
where
law
enforcement
agencies
are
being
more
aggressive
in
verifying
the
immigration
status
of
individuals
taken
into
custody
than
is
allowed
by
state
law
stump
said
routinely
especially
in
rural
communities
were
seeing
individuals
stopped
taken
into
custody
and
having
their
status
challenged
over
traffic
violations
other
experts
disagree
michelle
campney
an
oklahoma
city
attorney
associated
with
the
phillips
murrah
law
firm
said
the
provisions
of
oklahomas
immigration
law
that
havent
been
already
set
aside
by
federal
courts
would
probably
not
be
subject
to
federal
action
as
it
is
now
its
pretty
much
consistent
with
federal
law
she
said
but
if
there
was
one
provision
that
might
be
challenged
its
the
provision
that
you
have
to
provide
property
documentation
to
receive
state
assistance
if
there
was
any
part
of
the
oklahoma
law
thats
subject
to
being
questioned
that
would
be
it
federal
officials
said
the
arizona
laws
mandates
on
law
enforcement
will
result
in
the
harassment
and
detention
of
foreign
visitors
and
legal
immigrants
as
well
as
us
citizens
who
cannot
readily
prove
their
lawful
status
in
declarations
filed
with
the
lawsuit
arizona
law
enforcement
officials
including
the
chiefs
of
police
of
phoenix
and
tucson
said
the
law
would
hamper
their
ability
to
effectively
police
their
communities
 
both
men
said
victims
of
or
witnesses
to
crimes
would
be
less
likely
to
contact
or
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
officials
and
that
implementation
of
the
law
would
require
them
to
reassign
officers
from
critical
areas
such
as
violent
crimes
property
crimes
and
home
invasions
holder
said
the
suit
was
filed
after
extensive
consultation
with
arizona
officials
law
enforcement
officers
and
groups
and
civil
rights
advocates
the
suit
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
department
of
state
which
share
responsibilities
in
administering
federal
immigration
law
