president
clinton
yesterday
nominated
doris
m
meissner
as
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
announced
steppedup
efforts
to
end
the
transport
in
human
cargo
and
traffic
in
human
misery
by
cracking
down
on
organized
crime
rings
that
smuggle
illegal
immigrants
into
the
united
states
meissner
who
served
in
senior
ins
positions
during
the
reagan
administration
has
directed
immigration
and
refugee
studies
at
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
since
1986
in
a
white
house
ceremony
announcing
the
nomination
clinton
outlined
what
he
said
was
a
new
administration
strategy
to
combat
organized
crime
syndicates
that
ins
estimates
bring
about
100000
illegal
chinese
immigrants
to
the
united
states
each
year
though
still
in
its
planning
stages
the
strategy
calls
for
mandatory
detention
of
smuggled
immigrants
expanded
coast
guard
authority
to
board
suspected
smuggling
ships
on
the
high
seas
overseas
intelligence
gathering
and
diplomatic
pressure
on
immigrants
home
countries
and
nations
that
register
smuggling
ships
in
addition
administration
officials
said
clinton
would
propose
legislation
to
impose
penalties
of
up
to
20
years
for
smugglers
allow
prosecution
of
immigrant
smuggling
rings
under
racketeering
laws
and
streamline
the
asylum
process
to
decide
claims
in
less
than
a
month
officials
said
the
administration
favors
a
summary
exclusion
policy
under
which
an
asylum
officer
could
decide
on
the
spot
whether
an
immigrant
has
a
frivolous
asylum
claim
or
deserves
a
hearing
and
would
grant
immigrants
just
one
appeal
of
the
decision
administration
officials
said
they
did
not
know
how
much
it
would
cost
for
extra
staff
to
expedite
asylum
claims
the
ins
which
has
a
15
billion
budget
has
a
backlog
of
260000
asylum
cases
officials
said
more
details
would
be
available
only
after
a
comprehensive
twoweek
review
of
immigration
policies
ins
several
weeks
ago
instituted
a
mandatory
detention
policy
for
hundreds
of
smuggled
chinese
officials
stressed
such
detention
would
apply
only
to
immigrants
smuggled
by
organized
crime
rings
but
they
were
vague
about
what
constituted
smuggling
or
an
organized
ring
for
example
wouldbe
immigrants
who
pay
individuals
to
take
them
across
the
usmexico
border
would
not
be
subject
to
mandatory
detention
critics
have
long
clamored
for
reform
of
an
asylum
process
that
allows
illegal
immigrants
awaiting
hearings
to
work
for
years
and
in
many
cases
to
disappear
in
the
united
states
before
their
claims
are
decided
demands
for
reform
have
become
increasingly
strident
in
recent
weeks
as
outlines
emerged
of
an
elaborate
smuggling
ring
that
forced
chinese
immigrants
into
indentured
servitude
and
crime
to
pay
off
the
cost
of
their
passage
to
the
united
states
critics
also
had
chided
clinton
for
his
tardiness
in
appointing
ins
officials
and
enunciating
an
immigration
policy
which
they
said
contributed
to
the
impression
of
an
agency
in
disarray
this
is
the
first
major
immigrationrelated
policy
statement
weve
had
from
the
administration
said
dan
stein
head
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
which
favors
sharply
restricting
immigration
it
shows
that
from
his
initial
campaign
statements
hes
come
180
degrees
aboutface
and
that
hes
come
from
an
apparently
openarms
policy
to
a
pragmatic
and
realistic
policy
appropriate
for
the
modern
age
lawyer
and
immigration
advocate
rick
swartz
who
warned
that
a
hastier
asylum
process
ran
the
risk
of
rejecting
bona
fide
asylum
applicants
said
the
devil
and
serious
legal
questions
are
in
the
details
the
key
to
this
plans
effectiveness
may
be
cooperation
from
other
countries
and
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
devoted
for
this
purpose
meissners
nomination
was
generally
wellreceived
by
advocates
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
who
noted
it
was
the
first
time
in
many
years
that
someone
with
substantial
experience
in
immigration
matters
was
put
in
charge
of
the
agency
we
could
do
worse
said
stein
head
of
fair
he
said
meissner
51
was
tied
to
that
proimmigration
policy
clique
of
foundationsupported
groups
but
she
showed
good
management
skills
in
the
early
1980s
at
the
agency
where
she
for
a
time
served
as
acting
commissioner
cecilia
munoz
an
official
with
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
latino
rights
organization
said
that
although
we
disagree
with
her
in
some
policy
areas
if
anyones
qualified
to
do
the
job
ms
meissner
is
the
thing
we
need
most
now
is
the
voice
of
reason
to
counter
the
hysteria
over
immigration
and
