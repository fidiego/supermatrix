stoking
a
whitehot
debate
congress
is
pushing
ahead
legislation
that
would
impose
broad
new
restrictions
on
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
the
house
judiciary
committees
measure
mirrored
in
key
aspects
by
a
slowermoving
senate
bill
would
cut
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
from
the
800000
who
came
to
the
united
states
last
year
to
595000
in
2001
details
are
certain
to
change
before
the
legislation
reaches
president
clintons
desk
but
the
nation
clearly
is
poised
to
yank
in
its
welcome
mat
as
the
legislation
wends
its
way
through
congress
the
debate
will
serve
as
a
forum
for
this
question
is
immigration
good
for
america
opponents
of
the
bill
say
it
ignores
contributions
of
immigrants
and
dismisses
the
concept
of
the
american
melting
pot
proponents
argue
that
illegal
immigration
drains
resources
in
schools
prisons
and
hospitals
they
say
that
legal
immigration
should
focus
on
us
citizens
spouses
and
minor
children
rather
than
more
distant
relatives
if
illegal
immigration
has
reached
a
crisis
our
legal
immigration
system
has
reached
the
point
where
it
no
longer
serves
the
national
interest
said
lamar
smith
r
texas
chief
house
sponsor
of
the
immigration
bill
the
judiciary
committee
measure
would
overhaul
rules
for
those
who
seek
to
come
here
legally
and
would
launch
aggressive
new
strategies
to
thwart
those
who
cross
us
borders
unlawfully
as
a
practical
matter
we
really
dont
need
immigration
anymore
said
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
after
all
this
isnt
1810
were
not
trying
to
fill
up
a
wilderness
while
lawmakers
are
unlikely
to
satisfy
groups
such
as
steins
which
wants
a
moratorium
to
immigration
they
are
charting
a
course
that
seemed
unthinkable
before
california
overwhelmingly
approved
proposition
187
last
fall
that
measure
under
attack
in
the
courts
denies
most
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
in
that
state
the
house
bill
offers
a
watershed
in
the
manner
in
which
america
would
control
its
borders
among
other
measures
it
would
cap
the
number
of
immigrants
sponsored
by
us
relatives
at
330000
a
year
there
would
be
no
limits
for
spouses
and
minor
children
of
us
citizens
in
1994
about
462000
immigrants
including
adult
children
and
brothers
and
sisters
of
us
citizens
came
to
the
united
states
establish
a
system
under
which
employers
must
verify
the
eligibility
for
all
job
applicants
a
pilot
program
in
at
least
five
states
including
california
would
be
completed
by
1999
congress
could
expand
the
system
nationwide
a
move
critics
decry
as
the
first
step
toward
a
national
identification
card
call
for
construction
of
three
parallel
fences
for
14
miles
along
the
usmexico
border
in
san
diego
county
the
clinton
administration
has
said
that
plan
labeled
nutso
by
democrats
would
cost
as
much
as
110
million
tighten
the
rules
by
which
foreigners
gain
political
asylum
and
limit
to
50000
the
number
of
refugees
admitted
yearly
a
cut
of
about
50
percent
the
bill
also
would
prohibit
entry
of
foreigners
with
no
job
skills
and
no
family
ties
hasten
deportation
of
undocumented
foreigners
deny
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
and
double
the
border
patrol
force
this
bill
goes
so
far
beyond
what
is
reasonable
that
it
jeopardizes
the
whole
premise
of
our
immigration
system
said
cecilia
munoz
a
deputy
vice
president
at
the
national
council
of
la
raza
which
is
fighting
many
components
of
the
house
bill
it
has
several
absolutely
incredible
and
sweeping
provisions
that
dont
serve
anyone
some
conservative
republicans
have
joined
liberal
democrats
in
condemning
the
verification
system
and
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
calls
it
antibusiness
in
september
1994
a
national
commission
headed
by
former
texas
rep
barbara
jordan
called
for
national
registration
of
immigrants
and
a
neartotal
denial
of
benefits
and
public
services
to
illegal
immigrants
clintons
immigration
commissioner
doris
meissner
has
said
congress
should
concentrate
on
curbing
illegal
immigration
but
lawmakers
such
as
smith
are
using
popular
measures
to
trim
unlawful
immigration
as
a
lever
to
boost
lesspalatable
proposals
to
curb
legal
immigration
while
many
proimmigration
advocates
say
they
expect
the
house
to
kill
some
of
the
bills
more
severe
elements
they
concede
the
question
is
no
longer
whether
congress
acts
but
how
far
it
will
go
it
looks
like
theres
a
lot
of
momentum
for
these
cuts
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
pro
immigration
group
cuts
of
roughly
30
percent
in
legal
immigration
seem
like
a
lock
but
we
think
the
republicans
are
overshooting
they
think
the
american
people
dont
know
the
difference
between
legal
and
illegal
immigration
its
almost
like
they
aimed
at
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
and
shot
legal
immigration
instead
