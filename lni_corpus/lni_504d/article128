what
have
they
accomplished
five
years
into
a
legislative
surge
state
illegal
immigration

the
wave
of
immigration
laws
that
has
swept
through
states
since
2006
shows
few
signs
of
letting
up
with
state
legislators
expected
to
introduce
about
1400
bills
this
year
yet
five
years
into
this
legislative
surge
the
toughest
laws
have
not
recast
immigration
in
the
ways
that
legislators
might
have
intended
from
an
enforcement
standpoint
the
impact
of
state
antiimmigration
laws
like
arizonas
controversial
sb
1070
is
almost
negligible
says
veronica
dahlberg
an
immigrants
rights
activist
the
far
greater
impact
has
been
social
hispanic
groups
say
laws
targeting
illegal
immigrants
have
reflected
and
even
intensified
the
rising
anti
immigration
movement
both
in
statehouses
and
on
the
streets
the
result
is
a
legislative
record
from
arizona
to
florida
that
hasnt
made
much
of
a
mark
on
illegal
immigration
but
has
fueled
a
populist
backlash
against
it
this
is
particularly
true
in
some
places
because
theres
been
very
rapid
growth
in
immigrant
populations
says
marc
rosenblum
a
senior
analyst
at
the
migration
policy
institute
the
trend
was
sparked
by
a
dramatic
uptick
in
illegal
immigration
in
the
decade
before
2006
roughly
half
of
all
unauthorized
immigrants
now
in
the
country
some
6
million
in
all
came
to
the
united
states
during
that
period
the
response
from
state
legislatures
built
rapidly
in
2006
they
passed
twice
as
many
immigration
laws
as
they
had
a
year
earlier
by
2008
they
passed
five
times
the
2005
number
a
level
that
has
stayed
steady
since
last
year
state
legislators
introduced
about
1400
immigrationrelated
bills
more
than
200
of
which
became
laws
the
majority
of
these
laws
have
been
neutral
on
illegal
immigration
but
some
of
the
most
noteworthy
have
taken
a
tough
stance
and
more
of
the
same
is
expected
this
year
路about
a
dozen
states
are
now
considering
bills
like
arizonas
sb
1070
which
requires
police
officers
to
check
a
persons
immigration
status
during
routine
stops
路on
march
16
utah
gov
gary
herbert
r
signed
four
immigration
bills
which
would
among
other
things
allow
undocumented
immigrants
to
work
in
the
state
and
allow
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
arrested
for
serious
crimes
the
bills
were
seen
as
an
attempt
to
find
a
middle
ground
in
the
immigration
debate
路the
virginia
legislature
is
considering
an
effort
to
ban
unauthorized
immigrants
from
enrolling
in
public
universities
路a
florida
bill
would
require
anyone
employed
in
the
state
be
run
though
everify
a
federal
citizenship
and
immigration
registry
currently
all
federal
employees
and
contractors
must
be
run
through
everify
but
applying
this
to
all
workers
in
a
state
would
be
a
first
yet
the
track
record
for
recent
immigration
legislation
suggests
that
explicitly
antiillegal
immigration
bills
are
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
some
71
percent
of
the
state
immigration
laws
passed
from
2006
to
2010
were
neutral
toward
undocumented
immigrants
a
small
portion
of
these
laws
could
actually
be
said
to
be
tolerant
of
unauthorized
immigrants
such
as
a
2006
nebraska
law
granting
instate
tuition
to
some
unauthorized
immigrants
see
graphic
in
a
testament
to
the
difficulty
of
passing
tough
laws
arizona
defeated
a
bill
that
would
have
denied
citizenship
to
children
who
do
not
have
at
least
one
us
citizen
or
permanent
legal
resident
as
a
parent
moreover
by
some
measures
the
farthestreaching
laws
have
had
little
impact
arizonas
sb
1070
has
reportedly
yielded
no
arrests
and
enforcement
of
the
portion
of
the
law
requiring
police
officers
to
check
a
persons
immigration
status
is
being
delayed
by
a
court
challenge
oklahomas
hb
1804
was
hailed
by
supporters
as
the
toughest
state
immigration
law
in
the
us
in
2007
it
barred
unauthorized
immigrants
from
receiving
state
benefits
and
made
transporting
them
a
crime
after
a
year
the
law
had
yielded
three
arrests
and
one
conviction
the
associated
press
reported
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
state
and
local
policies
have
not
had
significant
effects
when
prince
william
county
in
virginia
passed
an
sb
1070style
law
in
2008
those
embroiled
in
the
debate
say
it
became
a
very
different
place
it
wasnt
just
that
a
law
was
passed
all
of
a
sudden
people
felt
threats
of
violence
says
film
producer
chris
rigopulos
after
a
screening
of
9500
liberty
a
documentary
on
the
law
in
arizona
an
estimated
100000
hispanics
left
the
state
in
the
months
after
sb
1070
was
enacted
according
to
a
bbva
bancomer
research
study
but
according
to
alicia
sandoval
who
left
arizona
for
ohio
this
mass
exodus
was
not
just
because
of
sb
1070
ms
sandoval
who
came
to
the
us
from
mexico
10
years
ago
says
the
law
only
formalized
what
had
been
going
on
for
years
when
we
first
came
to
arizona
there
was
no
fear
sandoval
says
through
an
interpreter
the
police
wouldnt
treat
you
bad
even
if
you
didnt
have
any
papers
but
that
has
changed
she
points
to
the
aggressive
policies
of
maricopa
county
sheriff
joe
arpaio
who
helped
deport
26000
people
from
2007
to
2010
all
before
sb
1070
sandoval
worked
at
a
bakery
in
the
heavily
hispanic
phoenix
neighborhood
and
often
saw
lines
of
cars
pulled
over
by
police
officers
when
she
got
off
work
at
1
am
she
says
police
would
find
reasons
such
as
expired
tags
to
pull
over
people
we
need
some
sort
of
education
on
how
we
can
be
integrated
into
the
community
and
not
be
separated
from
it
