two
immigration
ministers
central
american
refugee
claimants
who
are
returned
to
the
united
states
to
await
an
immigration
hearing
in
canada
have
no
guarantees
that
they
will
not
be
deported
both
employment
and
immigration
minister
benoit
bouchard
and
gerry
weiner
secretary
of
state
for
immigration
said
last
week
that
the
united
states
had
agreed
not
to
deport
the
refugee
claimants
and
to
allow
them
to
remain
until
their
inquiry
date
in
canada
however
alan
nelson
commissioner
of
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
said
in
a
letter
to
james
bissett
canadas
executive
director
of
immigration
that
individuals
found
to
be
deportable
would
be
handled
under
normal
us
immigration
procedures
in
the
letter
obtained
by
the
globe
and
mail
mr
nelson
offered
no
guarantees
that
salvadorean
or
guatemalan
refugee
claimants
sent
back
from
canada
would
not
be
deported
mr
nelson
said
that
if
an
alien
is
statutorily
eligible
for
voluntary
departure
from
the
united
states
the
district
directors
will
decide
at
their
discretion
on
a
case
by
case
basis
when
to
effect
such
a
departure
he
said
that
the
departure
may
be
set
to
coincide
with
the
date
that
the
aliens
inquiry
is
scheduled
in
canada
mr
nelson
stressed
that
individuals
will
be
immediately
taken
into
custody
and
removed
if
they
have
been
previously
processed
for
deportation
have
a
criminal
record
or
if
there
is
derogatory
information
mr
weiner
said
in
a
telephone
interview
from
montreal
yesterday
that
though
the
agreement
between
us
and
canadian
immigration
officials
is
not
ironclad
he
believes
the
americans
will
respect
the
arrangement
and
make
sure
refugee
claimants
are
available
for
their
hearing
in
canada
it
is
clearly
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
cooperate
he
said
that
his
officials
will
closely
monitor
the
situation
and
if
we
feel
that
people
are
not
available
for
our
inquiry
then
we
will
take
other
measures
mr
bissett
said
in
an
interview
that
canadian
immigration
officers
at
various
border
points
have
been
instructed
not
to
return
anyone
to
the
united
states
who
is
under
threat
of
deportation
on
the
weekend
more
than
300
central
americans
indicating
their
intention
to
claim
refugee
status
at
canadian
border
crossings
were
returned
to
the
united
states
until
immigration
inquiries
can
be
scheduled
six
were
allowed
to
remain
when
it
was
learned
that
they
were
previously
ordered
deported
by
us
immigration
mr
bissett
said
however
mr
bissett
said
canadian
immigration
officers
are
returning
all
refugee
claimants
with
a
criminal
record
or
where
there
is
derogatory
information
even
though
mr
nelsons
letter
says
they
will
be
deported
asked
what
derogatory
information
means
mr
bissett
said
he
interpreted
it
as
a
case
of
national
security
several
refugee
advocates
accused
the
government
and
in
particular
mr
weiner
of
misleading
the
public
into
thinking
that
a
firm
international
agreement
was
in
place
protecting
claimants
sent
back
to
the
united
states
lorne
waldman
a
toronto
immigration
lawyer
argued
that
the
socalled
agreement
doesnt
apply
any
protection
and
is
left
up
to
the
discretion
of
us
immigration
officers
its
quite
clear
that
mr
weiner
has
misled
the
canadian
public
in
an
effort
to
justify
the
governments
draconian
measures
to
keep
refugees
from
getting
into
the
country
mr
waldman
said
mr
weiner
should
reexamine
the
socalled
agreements
make
sure
real
guarantees
are
in
place
and
until
we
can
get
those
guarantees
the
minister
should
rescind
the
policy
he
announced
with
mr
bouchard
on
friday
katherine
rimar
a
us
lawyer
and
law
professor
in
buffalo
ny
said
her
information
from
refugee
groups
in
buffalo
is
that
every
refugee
claimant
at
the
peace
bridge
is
being
sent
back
without
any
screening
they
are
not
being
asked
if
they
are
under
a
deportation
order
in
the
us
however
james
campbell
director
of
enforcement
and
control
for
the
canadian
immigration
departments
ontario
region
said
every
case
returned
to
the
united
states
must
first
be
checked
with
us
immigration
officials
to
determine
if
they
will
guarantee
that
the
salvadorean
or
guatemalan
claimants
will
be
able
to
return
to
canada
for
their
inquiry
if
there
is
any
doubt
we
will
not
ship
them
back
meanwhile
a
major
backlog
is
developing
in
quebec
and
ontario
with
immigration
inquiries
now
being
scheduled
into
midapril
three
of
the
busiest
border
crossings
fort
erie
niagara
falls
and
windsor
have
two
immigration
adjudication
officers
assigned
to
handle
the
entire
load
mr
bissett
said
the
department
is
monitoring
the
situation
and
will
be
meeting
soon
to
decide
whether
to
bolster
our
adjudication
