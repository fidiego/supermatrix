with
the
overhaul
of
the
nations
health
care
system
almost
off
his
todo
list
president
barack
obama
has
renewed
his
promise
to
revamp
immigration
laws
this
year
i
pledge
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
forge
a
bipartisan
consensus
this
year
on
this
important
issue
obama
said
in
a
video
message
to
tens
of
thousands
of
activists
who
were
calling
for
revising
immigration
laws
as
they
gathered
last
sunday
on
washingtons
national
mall
chances
are
slim
to
none
that
the
president
will
fulfill
that
pledge
this
year
however
as
administration
officials
and
lawmakers
in
congress
have
put
several
other
priorities
from
tightening
financial
regulations
to
creating
jobs
ahead
of
overhauling
immigration
laws
furthermore
lawmakers
and
proimmigration
advocates
question
whether
obama
has
the
political
capital
and
congress
the
will
to
deal
with
another
potentially
divisive
hotbutton
issue
after
the
bruising
battle
over
health
care
and
with
novembers
midterm
elections
on
the
horizon
theres
nobody
in
there
ready
to
say
hey
lets
write
an
immigration
bill
nobody
said
sen
lindsey
graham
rsc
who
coauthored
an
immigration
framework
with
sen
charles
schumer
dny
that
the
president
recently
embraced
democrats
are
riskaverse
if
you
dont
believe
me
go
ask
them
about
whether
or
not
they
want
to
take
up
immigration
reform
in
the
senate
since
obama
took
office
theres
been
little
action
on
restructuring
federal
immigration
law
or
figuring
out
what
to
do
with
the
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
who
already
are
in
this
country
schumer
and
grahams
outline
of
a
bill
calls
for
creating
a
hightech
tamperproof
social
security
card
that
would
ensure
that
employers
hire
only
legal
workers
it
includes
a
temporary
worker
program
and
penalties
for
illegal
immigrants
fines
or
community
service
while
allowing
them
to
remain
in
the
us
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
introduced
a
bill
in
december
that
would
provide
100000
visas
for
immigrants
from
countries
that
have
high
illegal
immigration
rates
and
would
expedite
legal
immigration
for
close
relatives
of
us
citizens
and
legal
residents
democrats
and
republicans
called
gutierrezs
measure
a
nonstarter
however
theres
little
evidence
that
tackling
immigration
is
a
burning
priority
in
a
recent
wall
street
journal
interview
white
house
chief
of
staff
rahm
emanuel
didnt
even
mention
it
when
listing
obamas
posthealth
care
agenda
which
includes
dealing
with
financial
regulation
and
job
creation
retooling
the
no
child
left
behind
education
provisions
and
amending
campaignfinance
law
to
rebut
a
recent
us
supreme
court
ruling
that
permits
corporations
and
unions
to
finance
campaign
ads
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
dcalif
in
a
statement
about
sundays
immigration
rally
said
we
look
forward
to
sending
a
bipartisan
bill
to
the
presidents
desk
she
didnt
say
when
the
rev
samuel
rodriguez
the
president
of
the
national
hispanic
christian
leadership
conference
said
that
he
and
other
proimmigration
religious
leaders
met
monday
with
members
of
pelosis
staff
in
washington
and
were
told
that
any
movement
on
immigration
would
have
to
start
in
the
senate
they
looked
at
me
straight
in
the
eye
and
said
it
must
be
led
by
the
senate
rodriguez
said
i
left
the
meeting
at
pelosis
office
feeling
oh
boy
this
will
be
a
long
climb
im
not
sure
congress
is
ready
for
this
rodeo
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
dnev
said
wednesday
that
he
was
still
hopeful
about
getting
to
immigration
this
year
graham
said
however
that
if
obama
wanted
an
immigration
bill
he
should
write
it
himself
and
have
the
house
of
representatives
take
the
lead
because
partyline
votes
on
health
care
had
taken
the
oxygen
out
of
the
room
and
poisoned
the
well
in
the
senate
on
immigration
the
president
ought
to
put
one
out
there
on
his
own
graham
said
if
youre
telling
the
community
were
going
to
do
this
you
lead
you
just
cant
put
any
capital
in
it
and
say
its
a
big
deal
right
before
the
election
after
health
care
it
just
doesnt
make
any
sense
the
rev
jim
wallis
the
president
of
sojourners
a
liberal
christian
evangelical
network
said
he
came
away
from
meetings
with
congressional
democratic
leaders
feeling
that
the
desire
to
do
something
on
immigration
was
there
but
the
will
wasnt
is
there
political
support
for
it
in
washington
no
there
isnt
wallis
said
were
asking
them
to
generate
the
political
will
and
well
respond
with
public
support
rodriguez
said
that
obama
must
employ
the
same
sustained
public
sales
effort
and
private
armtwisting
strategy
he
used
to
get
the
health
bill
passed
if
he
wanted
to
get
an
immigration
bill
through
congress
the
question
is
if
the
president
has
the
political
capital
and
the
wherewithal
to
push
a
bill
through
rodriguez
said
if
immigration
isnt
addressed
before
novembers
elections
congressional
democrats
might
find
themselves
voted
out
of
office
by
the
same
latino
community
that
gave
obama
75
percent
of
its
vote
in
2008
largely
because
of
his
vow
to
change
immigration
laws
proimmigration
organizations
predict
that
latino
ire
over
a
lack
of
progress
on
immigration
policy
could
affect
as
many
as
40
congressional
races
in
november
including
reids
tough
reelection
bid
in
nevada
immigration
reform
is
a
litmus
test
in
the
latino
community
eliseo
medina
an
international
executive
vice
president
of
the
service
employees
international
union
said
last
month
to
us
this
is
a
policy
issue
but
it
is
also
an
issue
about
respect
