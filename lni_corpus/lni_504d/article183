two

challenging
the
constitutionality
of

law
and
the
promise
of
more
to

represent
the
latest
in
a
surge
of
outrage
over
the

measure
to
crack
down
on

the
lawsuits
follow
highprofile
protests
calls
for

and
a
travel
advisory
from
mexico
urging
its
citizens
to
steer
clear
of

but
findings
from
three
opinion
polls
released
in

seem
to
counter
the
anger

being

about

a

interactive
poll
of
2108
adults
conducted
from
april
1619
found
broad
support
for
major
immigration
reform
and
immigration
regulations
that
are
more
restrictive
79
percent
do
not
agree
that
illegal
aliens
are
entitled
to
the
same
rights
and
basic
freedoms
as
us
citizens
said
the
poll
these
results
reflect
another
kind
of
anger
over
illegal
immigration
says
jonette
christian
founder
of
mainers
for
immigration
reform
the
people
are
angry
and
confused
but
theyre
not
totally
out
to
lunch
she
says
they
know
that
something
really
big
and
bad
has
been
happening
to
their
country
and
they
never
asked
for
it
the
immigration
polls
findings
should
be
considered
carefully
observers
say
because
the
glaring
spotlight
on
complex
issues
like
arizonas
immigration
law
can
oversimplify
and
remove
important
dimensions
from
them
polling
has
limited
value
in
determining
how
to
address
complex
problems
says
ben
johnson
director
of
the
american
immigration
council
very
few
people
understand
the
complexities
of
immigration
law
and
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
about
how
and
why
people
are
here
illegally
it
doesnt
surprise
mr
johnson
that
a
majority
of
people
would
support
making
it
a
crime
to
transport
someone
who
is
an
illegal
immigrant
thats
already
against
the
law
he
says
the
deeper
questions
are
whether
people
are
ok
with
citizens
and
legal
residents
being
stopped
by
police
and
asked
to
prove
their
status
and
how
far
police
can
go
to
creating
the
reasonable
suspicion
immigrant
rights
groups
say
that
what
is
legal
and
what
is
right
are
often
at
odds
in
ways
that
public
opinion
surveys
and
news
reports
tend
to
overlook
a
law
being
popular
or
supported
by
the
majority
does
not
mean
that
is
morally
correct
says
randy
ertll
executive
director
of
el
centro
de
accion
social
in
pasadena
calif
the
current
economic
climate
could
also
be
tilting
poll
responses
say
political
scientists
these
polls
are
correct
but
seem
to
reflect
the
downturn
in
the
economy
says
barbara
oconnor
director
of
the
institute
for
the
study
of
politics
and
media
at
california
state
university
sacramento
history
has
a
way
of
showing
that
when
times
are
tough
people
lash
out
more
strongly
against
what
they
feel
is
beyond
their
control
in
this
case
immigrants
government
attitudes
also
come
into
play
says
joe
nevins
a
political
scientist
and
immigration
specialist
at
vassar
college
in
poughkeepsie
ny
a
combination
of
an
economic
recession
and
more
important
a
longterm
campaign
by
the
federal
government
to
teach
the
public
that
unauthorized
immigration
is
a
crime
has
made
a
lawandorder
approach
to
matters
of
unauthorized
migration
a
nobrainer
for
most
he
says
but
the
results
of
these
polls
miss
the
point
says
lara
brown
an
immigration
specialist
at
villanova
university
there
is
more
consensus
on
this
topic
among
americans
than
most
politicians
seem
to
believe
the
majority
of
americans
are
not
antiimmigrant
proillegals
or
in
favor
of
a
police
state
brown
says
instead
they
want
government
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
and
they
want
america
to
continue
to
be
a
country
that
stands
by
its
long
heritage
of
welcoming
those
as
the
inscription
on
the
statute
of
liberty

who
