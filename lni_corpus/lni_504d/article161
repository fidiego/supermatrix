the
injunction
issued
wednesday
by
a
federal
court
judge
has
left
the
implementation
of
arizonas
immigration
law
in
doubt
not
in
question
however
is
the
sad
reality
that
the
ongoing
fight
over
illegal
immigration
enforcement
is
tearing
the
country
in
two
the
fight
is
pitting
the
federal
government
against
arizona
in
a
battle
to
determine
just
who
has
the
ultimate
authority
in
the
thorny
issue
the
federal
government
which
dragged
its
feet
for
so
many
years
on
immigration
reform
now
opposes
a
law
that
in
a
very
real
sense
it
helped
to
create
arizona
a
state
hit
hard
by
years
of
illegal
immigration
that
the
nation
failed
to
control
or
even
address
in
frustration
was
forced
to
take
enforcement
into
its
own
hands
the
arizona
law
should
have
forced
the
federal
government
to
finally
confront
its
own
poor
record
on
immigration
management
and
enforcement
instead
the
obama
administration
simply
sued
and
the
already
polarized
discussion
over
immigration
reform
became
even
more
divided
thats
why
we
want
to
give
credit
to
one
san
fernando
valley
man
who
was
profiled
in
the
daily
news
earlier
this
week
robert
gittelson
stepped
into
a
debate
so
harsh
that
no
one
can
walk
away
without
being
muddied
the
former
businessman
has
spent
his
time
money
and
energy
to
bring
a
new
voice
to
the
illegal
immigration
discussion
whats
unique
about
gittelsons
approach
is
that
he
brings
a
perspective
largely
absent
from
the
immigration
debate
that
of
evangelical
christians
to
be
clear
the
daily
news
is
not
endorsing
gittlesons
organization
or
its
position
we
are
simply
glad
to
hear
new
voices
pushing
for
immigration
reform
the
more
americans
who
pipe
up
and
push
their
representatives
to
take
action
the
more
likely
that
the
country
will
enact
some
sort
of
real
and
meaningful
immigration
reform
the
situation
now
where
the
feds
refuse
to
move
decisively
but
then
crack
down
on
those
who
in
desperation
do
only
serves
to
take
us
farther
away
from
a
solution
illegal
immigration
is
a
complicated
problem
thats
not
going
to
be
solved
by
a
simple
directive
and
coming
to
a
solution
will
take
the
input
of
all
americans
not
just
the
extremists
on
either
side
shouting
matches
between
immigrantrights
activists
demanding
automatic
citizenship
for
lawbreakers
and
antiimmigrant
factions
demanding
all
latinos
be
rounded
up
and
sent
to
mexico
only
add
fuel
to
the
firestorm
whats
needed
are
cooler
heads
willing
to
work
toward
compromise
gittelsons
group
is
one
more
muchneeded
voice
in
this
discussion
we
hope
that
he
inspires
others
to
join
the
fray
and
to
put
pressure
on
our
legislators
and
president
to
finally
draft
comprehensive
immigration
reform
until
that
happens
we
can
expect
more
money
time
and
energy
wasted
on
lawsuits
between
government
agencies
and
no
real
solutions
to
whats
tearing
the
country
apart
