federal
appeals
court
judges
around
the
nation
have
repeatedly
excoriated
immigration
judges
this
year
for
what
they
call
a
pattern
of
biased
and
incoherent
decisions
in
asylum
cases
in
one
decision
last
month
richard
a
posner
a
prominent
and
relatively
conservative
federal
appeals
court
judge
in
chicago
concluded
that
the
adjudication
of
these
cases
at
the
administrative
level
has
fallen
below
the
minimum
standards
of
legal
justice
similarly
the
federal
appeals
court
in
philadelphia
said
in
september
that
it
had
time
and
time
again
been
forced
to
rebuke
immigration
judges
for
their
intemperate
and
humiliating
remarks
citing
cases
from
around
the
country
the
court
wrote
of
a
disturbing
pattern
of
misconduct
in
immigration
rulings
that
sent
people
back
to
countries
where
they
had
said
they
would
face
persecution
the
harsh
criticism
may
stem
in
part
from
a
surge
in
immigration
cases
before
the
federal
appeals
courts
immigration
cases
most
involving
asylum
seekers
accounted
for
about
17
percent
of
all
federal
appeals
cases
last
year
up
from
just
3
percent
in
2001
in
the
courts
in
new
york
and
california
nearly
40
percent
of
federal
appeals
involved
immigration
cases
the
increase
occurred
after
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
made
changes
in
2002
to
streamline
appellate
review
within
the
immigration
courts
which
are
part
of
the
justice
department
many
federal
appeals
court
judges
say
those
changes
essentially
shifted
work
to
their
courts
the
justice
department
counters
that
the
increase
is
largely
unrelated
to
the
ashcroft
changes
and
is
instead
the
result
of
a
higher
rate
of
appeals
in
the
courts
in
new
york
and
california
jonathan
cohn
a
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
justice
department
said
the
quality
of
the
decisions
rendered
by
the
immigration
courts
on
the
whole
was
good
noting
that
the
government
won
more
than
90
percent
of
the
cases
in
the
federal
appeals
or
circuit
courts
the
circuit
courts
do
not
see
any
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
correctly
decided
cases
that
aliens
choose
not
to
appeal
mr
cohn
said
theyre
only
seeing
a
fraction
of
the
cases
and
only
a
small
fraction
of
those
give
rise
to
criticism
but
that
criticism
can
be
very
sharp
particularly
given
the
temperate
language
that
is
the
norm
in
the
federal
appellate
courts
in
the
philadelphia
decision
in
september
judge
julio
m
fuentes
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
had
this
to
say
about
annie
s
garcy
an
immigration
judge
or
ij
in
newark
the
tone
the
tenor
the
disparagement
and
the
sarcasm
of
the
ij
seem
more
appropriate
to
a
court
television
show
than
a
federal
court
proceeding
judge
garcy
ordered
qun
wang
returned
to
china
where
he
said
his
wife
had
been
forcibly
sterilized
hes
a
horrible
father
as
far
as
the
courts
concerned
judge
garcy
ruled
saying
mr
wang
was
obsessed
with
having
a
son
and
did
not
pay
enough
attention
to
his
daughter
who
is
disabled
all
of
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
issues
before
judge
garcy
judge
fuentes
wrote
returning
the
case
to
the
immigration
system
for
a
rehearing
before
a
different
judge
the
factual
issue
before
judge
garcy
judge
fuentes
wrote
had
been
only
whether
wangs
wife
had
been
forcibly
sterilized
and
whether
if
he
returned
to
china
the
chinese
government
would
inflict
improper
punishment
on
him
for
leaving
the
country
through
a
spokeswoman
judge
garcy
declined
to
comment
in
another
decision
judge
marsha
s
berzon
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
san
francisco
said
a
decision
by
nathan
w
gordon
an
immigration
judge
was
literally
incomprehensible
incoherent
and
indecipherable
a
crucial
sentence
in
judge
gordons
decision
she
said
defies
parsing
under
ordinary
rules
of
english
grammar
judge
gordon
ordered
ernesto
adolfo
recinos
de
leon
returned
to
guatemala
notwithstanding
mr
recinoss
testimony
that
he
would
be
persecuted
there
for
his
political
activities
judge
berzon
sent
the
case
back
to
the
immigration
system
for
another
hearing
judge
gordon
now
retired
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
spokesman
for
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
the
unit
of
the
justice
department
responsible
for
immigration
adjudications
declined
requests
for
interviews
with
officials
there
but
provided
answers
to
written
questions
we
would
caution
against
drawing
broad
conclusions
the
statement
said
from
a
small
number
of
cases
in
the
federal
courts
the
nations
roughly
215
immigration
judges
the
statement
continued
handle
more
than
300000
matters
every
year
and
the
vast
majority
of
ijs
do
an
excellent
job
given
such
a
large
caseload
denise
noonan
slavin
the
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
a
union
affiliated
with
the
aflcio
said
she
was
concerned
about
what
she
called
the
rising
number
of
scathing
opinions
from
federal
appeals
court
judges
to
go
namecalling
and
having
an
open
season
on
judges
its
crossing
the
line
of
civility
judge
slavin
said
that
is
not
to
say
that
immigration
judges
dont
make
mistakes
but
lory
diana
rosenberg
a
former
judge
on
the
administrative
body
within
the
justice
department
that
reviews
decisions
from
immigration
judges
before
they
reach
the
federal
appeals
courts
said
the
recent
criticisms
were
warranted
theyre
a
brave
honest
and
proper
reaction
ms
rosenberg
said
to
a
pattern
of
unfettered
misuse
of
authority
mary
m
schroeder
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
hears
almost
half
of
all
immigration
appeals
said
the
current
system
was
woefully
inadequate
immigration
judges
she
said
are
very
unevenly
qualified
and
they
work
under
very
bad
conditions
the
people
who
appear
before
immigration
judges
often
do
not
speak
english
and
their
cases
often
turn
in
part
on
changing
political
and
social
conditions
around
the
world
in
a
decision
in
march
judge
posner
wrote
that
immigration
judges
lack
of
familiarity
with
relevant
foreign
cultures
was
disturbing
judge
slavin
who
sits
in
miami
disagreed
saying
she
and
her
colleagues
often
had
a
sophisticated
understanding
of
conditions
in
the
most
relevant
countries
which
are
china
for
immigration
judges
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
eastern
europe
for
those
in
chicago
haiti
columbia
and
venezuela
for
those
in
miami
and
central
and
south
america
for
those
in
california
i
know
more
about
haitian
politics
than
the
people
coming
before
me
judge
slavin
said
but
she
acknowledged
both
the
difficulty
and
the
importance
of
her
work
immigration
law
can
be
lifeordeath
decisions
in
terms
of
whether
youre
going
to
send
someone
back
to
a
place
where
they
may
be
killed
judge
slavin
said
i
have
over
1000
cases
on
my
docket
most
of
us
do
about
four
decisions
a
day
in
texas
on
the
border
you
might
get
10
a
day
judges
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
system
blame
the
administrative
body
between
them
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
the
surge
in
appeals
and
the
mixed
quality
of
the
decisions
reaching
the
federal
appeals
courts
the
board
is
meant
to
act
as
a
filter
correcting
erroneous
or
intemperate
decisions
from
the
immigration
judges
and
providing
general
guidance
the
losing
party
can
appeal
the
boards
decision
to
the
federal
courts
but
the
board
largely
stopped
reviewing
immigration
cases
in
a
meaningful
way
after
it
was
restructured
by
mr
ashcroft
in
2002
several
judges
said
mr
ashcroft
reduced
the
number
of
judges
on
the
board
to
11
from
23
they
just
hacked
off
all
the
liberals
is
basically
what
they
did
said
ms
rosenberg
who
served
on
the
board
from
1995
to
2002
mr
ashcroft
also
expanded
the
number
of
appeals
heard
by
a
single
board
member
and
encouraged
the
use
of
oneword
affirmances
in
appropriate
cases
the
goal
of
the
changes
mr
ashcroft
said
was
streamlining
the
board
had
a
backlog
of
more
than
56000
cases
which
fell
to
32000
by
september
2004
at
a
conference
at
new
york
law
school
in
september
john
m
walker
jr
the
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
new
york
said
the
changes
at
the
board
level
served
to
transfer
its
backlog
to
his
court
and
other
federal
appeals
courts
he
just
moved
the
problem
from
one
court
to
another
court
judge
walker
said
of
mr
ashcroft
in
the
two
and
a
half
years
after
april
2002
said
john
r
b
palmer
a
staff
lawyer
at
the
second
circuit
his
court
received
twice
as
many
appeals
from
immigration
board
decisions
as
it
had
in
the
previous
30
years
combined
several
federal
appeals
court
judges
said
they
were
frustrated
by
the
quality
of
the
boards
review
of
decisions
from
immigration
judges
in
his
march
decision
judge
posner
wrote
that
the
board
often
affirmed
either
with
no
opinion
or
with
a
very
short
unhelpful
boilerplate
opinion
even
when
the
immigration
judge
had
committed
manifest
errors
of
fact
and
logic
as
a
consequence
judge
walker
said
were
the
first
meaningful
review
that
the
petitioner
has
in
its
statement
the
immigration
review
office
said
we
absolutely
disagree
with
judge
walkers
comment
each
decision
that
comes
before
the
board
is
carefully
reviewed
by
a
staff
attorney
and
at
least
one
board
member
the
statement
said
according
to
the
office
the
number
of
oneword
affirmances
dropped
this
year
to
about
20
percent
from
about
a
third
in
previous
years
the
solution
to
some
of
what
recent
criticisms
identified
as
problems
several
federal
appeals
court
judges
said
is
to
add
positions
to
the
immigration
board
and
to
require
judges
there
to
explain
the
reasons
for
their
decisions
at
least
write
a
couple
of
pages
three
pages
said
jon
o
newman
a
judge
on
the
second
circuit
it
would
really
help
us
an
article
to
be
published
early
next
year
in
the
georgetown
immigration
law
journal
concludes
that
the
shift
toward
the
federal
appeals
court
was
triggered
by
the
high
volume
of
bia
decisions
issued
starting
in
march
2002
and
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
bias
review
in
its
statement
the
immigration
review
office
disagreed
the
surge
in
federal
appeals
the
statement
said
is
not
related
to
the
boards
increased
number
of
decisions
but
the
rate
of
appeal
in
some
parts
of
the
country
immigrants
appeal
only
7
percent
of
the
time
the
statement
said
in
the
states
covered
by
the
federal
appeals
courts
in
new
york
and
california
the
appeals
rate
is
now
more
than
30
percent
at
an
argument
in
an
appeal
of
an
immigration
case
in
september
in
chicago
the
three
judges
on
the
panel
expressed
exasperation
with
the
current
state
of
affairs
does
the
justice
department
have
any
idea
of
what
is
happening
to
your
cases

court

cindy

judge
she
said
yes

a

sympathy
it
is
so
cruel
to
send
