terror

is
so
tight
that
nearly
half
the
justice
departments
220
immigration
judges
lack
the
security
clearance
needed
to
hear
the
special
cases
we
have
112
immigration
judges
with
security
clearances
of

out
of
220
judges
overall
rick
kenney
spokesman
for
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
said
in
an
interview
yesterday
mr
kenney
said
cases
have
been
heard
under
the
new
security
procedures
at
some
of
the
52
regional
immigration
courts
but
even
chief
immigration
judge
michael
j
creppy
who
implemented
the
procedure
would
not
estimate
the
number
there
is
no
way
to
tell
how
many
cases
are
being
heard
that
way
because
we
are
not
counting
them
mr
kenney
said
organizations
wanting
to
defend
accused
foreigners
were
so
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
information
that
a
group
led
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
filed
a
lawsuit
here
last
week
to
penetrate
the
secrecy
most
aliens
just
happened
to
get
caught
in
the
net
they
dont
know
anything
at
all
said
james
zogby
of
the
arab
american
institute
visa
violators
and
terror
suspects
are
simply
not
the
same
thing
this
is
the
challenge
said
jeanne
butterfield
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
which
seeks
to
match
volunteer
lawyers
with
inmates
you
can
imagine
thats
somewhat
difficult
when
you
cant
find
out
who
is
detained
and
whether
or
not
they
are
represented
by
counsel
she
said
im
in
despair
wondering
who
is
representing
these
folks
justice
department
officials
up
to
and
including
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
insist
detainees
awaiting
immigration
hearings
have
access
to
telephones
and
lists
of
legal
aid
groups
many
aspects
of
immigration
court
secrecy
have
been
debated
since
judge
creppy
issued
orders
carrying
out
mr
ashcrofts
antiterrorism
directive
but
the
extent
to
which
judges
of
the
immigration
court
are
shut
out
of
cases
was
not
widely
known
even
among
lawyers
who
specialize
in
the
field
judge
creppys
order
detailed
how
computers
and
files
should
be
coded
so
that
neither
the
substance
of
the
case
nor
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
hearing
shows
up
on
computers
or
through
automated
telephone
services
public
requests
for
information
by
case
number
receive
a
warning
warning
notice
and
computers
alert
court
clerks
whenever
anyone
else
attempts
to
enter
the
ansir
record
according
to
the
order
which
uses
the
acronym
for
the
automated
nationwide
system
for
immigration
review
ansir
contains
similar
safeguards
to
protect
identities
in
immigration
cases
where
battered
children
or
battered
spouses
are
involved
so
many
judges
lack
security
clearance
mr
kenney
said
because
in
the
past
there
havent
been
many
cases
involving
classified
information
there
wasnt
a
crying
need
for
all
immigration
judges
to
be
cleared
he
said
judge
creppy
said
yesterday
if
necessary
and
as
the
need
arises
we
will
obtain
more
security
clearances
the
new
prospect
that
some
cases
may
ultimately
involve
classified
evidence
keeps
the
108
immigration
judges
who
lack
clearance
from
conducting
hearings
on
what
the
justice
department
designates
as
cases
requiring
special
procedures
that
category
may
be
requested
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
from
which
the
court
is
independent
or
by
the
justice
department
to
which
both
organizations
belong
no
visitors
no
family
and
no
press
judge
creppy
directed
in
his
order
implementing
the
extraordinary
procedures
you
should
instruct
all
courtroom
personnel
that
they
are
not
to
discuss
the
case
with
anyone
he
said
of
hearings
that
previously
could
be
opened
to
the
public
normally
cases
are
open
but
there
are
exceptions
on
a
casebycase
basis
mr
kenney
said
however
the
respondents
whose
deportation
is
at
stake
plus
their
attorneys
when
they
have
one
are
present
along
with
security
officers
stenographers
and
other
court
employees
immigration
lawyers
cannot
be
required
to
have
security
clearances
mr
kenney
said
we
cant
require
clearance
for
anyone
who
doesnt
work
for
us
he
said
however
he
pointed
out
that
lawyers
and
their
clients
in
cases
designated
as
special
are
entitled
only
to
see
unclassified
summaries
of
the
information
when
secret
evidence
is
involved
a
senate
bill
is
pending
that
would
nullify
even
that
requirement
