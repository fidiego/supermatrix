dueling
sound
bites
from
candidates
for
the
republican
presidential
nomination
have
put
immigration
at
the
forefront
of
this
years
presidential
campaign
the
bursts
of
rhetoric
on
the
subject
leave
many
unanswered
questions
but
they
have
helped
to
crystallize
the
serious
divisions
on
immigration
that
exist
within
the
republican
party
these
divisions
are
about
to
come
to
a
head
in
congress
where
both
the
senate
and
house
are
set
to
debate
legislation
aimed
at
cutting
back
on
legal
immigration
as
well
as
cracking
down
on
illegal
entries
the
first
battleground
is
the
senate
judiciary
committee
where
influential
republicans
have
joined
forces
with
a
motley
coalition
of
business
labor
religious
ethnic
and
proimmigration
groups
to
attack
a
major
immigration
reform
bill
sponsored
by
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
a
retiring
party
elder
who
seeks
to
make
the
legislation
his
swan
song
the
opponents
want
to
split
the
bill
shelving
the
sections
dealing
with
legal
immigration
and
focusing
only
on
illegal
immigration
the
committee
is
to
take
up
the
measure
today
in
march
the
full
house
is
scheduled
to
consider
an
omnibus
immigration
reform
bill
sponsored
by
rep
lamar
smith
rtex
while
smith
is
confident
that
he
can
beat
back
attempts
to
split
his
bill
in
similar
fashion
key
republicans
including
house
majority
leader
richard
k
armey
tex
have
expressed
reservations
about
restricting
legal
immigration
and
other
elements
of
the
package
notably
steps
toward
establishment
of
a
national
employment
verification
system
to
check
the
identities
of
jobseekers
immigration
is
a
highstakes
issue
for
the
republican
party
and
divisions
over
it
may
have
serious
political
consequences
this
election
year
said
frank
sharry
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
which
supports
legal
immigration
although
there
is
broad
support
for
curtailing
illegal
immigration
measures
against
legal
immigrants
he
said
risk
offending
many
new
voters
including
hispanics
and
asian
americans
in
california
texas
florida
illinois
new
york
and
other
states
rich
in
electoral
votes
these
voters
are
politically
up
for
grabs
sharry
said
if
the
republicans
are
going
to
alienate
the
fastestgrowing
groups
of
new
voters
its
hard
to
imagine
them
sustaining
their
majority
through
the
next
election
the
prospect
clearly
worries
influential
republicans
such
as
former
education
secretary
william
j
bennett
and
former
housing
secretary
jack
kemp
in
a
news
conference
yesterday
they
issued
a
study
extolling
the
benefits
of
legal
immigration
in
an
effort
to
correct
what
they
described
as
distortions
in
the
presidential
campaign
and
in
congress
leading
the
antiimmigration
charge
on
the
campaign
trail
has
been
buchanan
who
promises
to
build
a
security
fence
along
the
usmexican
border
and
defend
it
with
troops
if
necessary
he
also
advocates
a
fiveyear
moratorium
on
legal
immigration
to
give
america
time
to
absorb
the
flood
of
immigrants
in
recent
years
at
times
his
critics
say
buchanans
rhetoric
has
seemed
tinged
with
xenophobia
listen
jose
youre
not
coming
in
this
time
he
shouted
at
one
recent
rally
during
his
1992
campaign
for
president
he
complained
of
having
to
walk
past
these
guys
sitting
on
the
corner
playing
bongo
drums
in
his
own
home
town
washington
dc
behind
the
applause
lines
however
details
of
buchanans
plans
seem
to
be
in
short
supply
at
times
he
has
spoken
of
erecting
a
double
chainlinked
security
fence
along
250
miles
of
border
and
at
other
times
the
distance
has
been
60
or
70
miles
precisely
where
along
the
2000mile
border
this
fence
would
go
up
and
how
much
it
would
cost
remain
open
questions
according
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
there
is
already
a
total
of
316
miles
of
fencing
along
the
border
including
44
miles
of
reinforced
fences
made
of
surplus
iron
runway
mats
in
the
most
heavily
traversed
areas
then
there
is
the
problem
of
using
troops
to
repel
illegal
aliens
which
immigration
experts
say
would
violate
longstanding
legal
constraints
on
using
the
military
for
domestic
law
enforcement
purposes
neither
buchanan
nor
alexander
has
clarified
this
point
and
alexander
has
at
times
reacted
testily
when
asked
how
much
his
proposal
to
create
a
new
branch
of
the
armed
forces
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
and
drug
trafficking
would
cost
its
not
a
serious
proposal
said
dan
stein
head
of
the
antiimmigration
group
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
forbes
meanwhile
reflects
a
libertarian
probusiness
view
of
immigration
arguing
that
legal
immigrants
help
america
to
maintain
its
hightech
edge
in
the
global
economy
he
derides
the
idea
of
creating
a
new
branch
of
the
armed
forces
as
the
typical
problemsolving
approach
of
a
lifetime
politician
for
his
part
forbes
says
he
wants
to
reform
the
ins
and
streamline
deportation
procedures
like
his
opponents
however
he
provides
no
details
of
what
he
has
in
mind
dole
has
called
immigration
a
big
issue
in
96
but
has
avoided
taking
firm
stands
so
far
on
specific
controversies
such
as
the
simpson
bill

the
senate
