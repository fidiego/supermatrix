responding
to
a
rising
tide
of
antiimmigration
sentiment
the
clinton
administration
said
today
that
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
deported
this
year
was
a
record
51600
up
15
percent
from
1994
and
up
nearly
75
percent
from
1990
most
of
the
increase
came
from
deportations
of
criminals
who
are
illegal
aliens
nearly
62
percent
of
those
deported
this
year
were
prison
inmates
who
were
expelled
after
serving
their
sentences
up
from
526
percent
in
1991
and
4
percent
in
1986
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
also
announced
a
sharp
increase
in
the
number
of
people
turned
away
at
the
nations
borders
for
trying
to
enter
illegally
to
9400
from
5669
were
putting
a
very
heavy
emphasis
on
making
the
system
work
properly
said
doris
meissner
commissioner
of
the
immigration
service
in
order
for
the
system
to
work
properly
the
final
orders
for
deportation
and
exclusion
have
to
count
for
something
in
the
past
they
have
not
been
effectively
enforced
the
increase
is
occurring
as
congress
is
considering
bills
aimed
at
reducing
both
the
number
of
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
and
when
immigration
is
expected
to
be
an
important
issue
in
big
states
like
california
and
florida
that
will
be
crucial
to
president
clinton
in
the
1996
election
contenders
for
the
republican
nomination
especially
patrick
j
buchanan
the
conservative
commentator
have
made
anger
about
immigration
a
central
campaign
theme
at
the
white
house
the
issue
is
being
handled
by
rahm
emanuel
the
former
white
house
political
director
who
now
is
president
clintons
assistant
for
strategic
planning
and
communications
this
assignment
indicates
the
political
importance
the
administration
places
on
immigration
for
illegal
aliens
who
manage
to
evade
the
border
patrol
overstay
their
temporary
visas
and
do
not
run
afoul
of
the
law
once
here
the
chances
of
being
caught
continue
to
be
slight
not
counting
the
inmates
more
than
90
percent
of
the
illegal
immigrants
who
are
sent
back
are
halted
at
the
border
and
some
antiimmigration
groups
say
with
an
estimated
four
million
illegal
aliens
living
in
the
country
and
with
200000
more
settling
here
every
year
the
removal
of
51600
persons
represents
little
more
than
opening
a
small
sluice
in
a
lake
being
fed
by
many
streams
as
a
result
the
groups
say
the
increase
in
deportations
is
more
symbolic
than
significant
its
nice
that
theyre
making
a
priority
of
removing
criminal
aliens
but
the
bottom
line
is
most
illegal
aliens
dont
go
home
said
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
of
american
immigration
reform
a
group
that
wants
to
cut
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
the
chances
of
being
apprehended
and
deported
once
you
get
past
the
border
patrol
is
less
than
1
percent
still
officials
of
some
pro
and
antiimmigration
groups
say
the
increase
in
removals
is
a
significant
change
of
focus
for
the
ins
this
is
a
pretty
big
increase
said
jessica
vaughan
assistant
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
study
a
research
institute
that
argues
that
current
levels
of
immigration
have
a
harmful
affect
on
minorities
and
the
poor
i
remember
a
few
years
ago
it
was
around
30000
a
year
the
goal
seems
to
be
getting
it
up
as
high
as
possible
so
that
the
administration
could
be
seen
doing
something
about
it
and
while
some
experts
say
the
the
emphasis
on
deportation
is
good
policy
virtually
all
say
there
is
a
political
dimension
to
the
administrations
stepped
up
efforts
there
is
an
antiimmigrant
wave
thats
sweeping
the
country
right
now
which
is
being
exploited
politically
by
people
in
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
said
lucas
guttentag
director
of
national
immigrants
rights
project
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
clinton
administration
wants
to
preempt
immigration
from
being
a
political
issue
in
the
1996
campaign
experts
in
the
area
of
immigration
attribute
much
of
the
rise
in
deportations
to
the
agencys
decision
to
concentrate
its
resources
on
enforcement
in
addition
while
many
federal
agencies
are
coping
with
budget
cuts
the
spending
bill
for
the
ins
pending
in
congress
would
provide
a
1287
million
increase
for
the
agencys
enforcement
divisions
including
an
increase
of
1400
people
mainly
detention
and
deportation
officers
but
in
recent
years
two
other
changes
in
law
and
policy
have
spurred
deportations
in
july
the
ins
and
the
justice
department
beefed
up
inspections
of
documents
of
people
crossing
the
border
south
of
san
diego
as
a
result
3029
illegal
aliens
were
turned
away
and
their
names
entered
in
a
computerized
identification
system
in
1994
the
service
expanded
its
program
to
hold
deportation
hearings
for
illegal
aliens
who
were
incarcerated
for
various
crimes
in
state
prisons
the
program
was
begun
in
1988
but
was
expanded
last
year
in
the
five
states
with
the
largest
populations
of
illegal
aliens
california
florida
illinois
new
york
and
texas
before
the
program
aliens
were
sent
to
federal
detention
centers
after
serving
their
terms
to
await
deportation
hearings
if
there
was
no
space
available
for
them
they
were
set
free
and
were
ordered
to
return
voluntarily
for
their
hearings
