assemblyman
ray
haynes
proposal
to
create
a
state
immigration
police
force
to
help
patrol
the
border
and
enforce
immigration
laws
statewide
could
meet
resistance
from
the
federal
government
and
be
disputed
in
the
courts
beyond
borders
a
special
report
on
immigration
haynes
initiative
petition
proposal
announced
earlier
this
month
would
create
a
new
agency
with
hired
officers
and
trained
volunteers
who
would
strictly
enforce
immigration
laws
if
it
makes
the
statewide
ballot
and
is
approved
by
voters
haynes
rtemecula
cites
a
1996
provision
of
a
law
that
allows
state
and
local
agencies
to
negotiate
agreements
with
the
federal
government
to
enforce
immigration
laws
but
federal
officials
say
the
law
has
never
been
applied
to
create
officers
strictly
devoted
to
immigration
and
they
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
we
would
not
create
a
memorandum
of
understanding
that
created
fulltime
immigration
officers
because
we
have
fulltime
immigration
officers
said
manny
van
pelt
a
spokesman
for
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
which
negotiates
such
agreements
on
behalf
of
the
us
attorney
generals
office
the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
used
is
as
a
tool
to
help
officers
in
the
street
or
in
the
jails
to
help
them
do
their
daytoday
jobs
in
addition
to
their
normal
routine
haynes
says
he
interprets
the
law
287g
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
to
mean
states
can
step
in
and
enforce
immigration
laws
after
technicalities
are
worked
out
with
the
government
im
sure
we
can
influence
ice
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
us
or
we
can
influence
them
through
the
legislative
process
haynes
said
one
way
or
another
we
will
get
it
done
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
created
in
2003
as
part
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
investigates
and
enforces
suspected
customs
and
immigration
violations
in
the
country
and
carries
out
judicial
rulings
on
immigration
cases
haynes
wants
the
state
agency
that
would
be
created
by
his
proposal
to
use
any
means
available
to
enforce
the
law
including
worksite
enforcement
memos
negotiated
so
far
with
a
couple
of
agencies
in
the
nation
have
prohibited
law
enforcement
officers
from
conducting
immigration
raids
on
businesses
or
doing
worksite
enforcement
van
pelt
said
meanwhile
experts
disagree
as
to
whether
a
plan
for
a
separate
state
immigration
police
force
would
be
constitutional
or
allowed
state
and
local
agencies
have
the
inherent
authority
to
enforce
federal
law
unless
congress
specifically
prevents
them
from
doing
so
said
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
washington
dcbased
center
for
immigration
studies
congress
can
and
has
preempted
the
states
from
enforcing
other
areas
of
law
but
immigration
isnt
one
of
them
krikorian
said
immigration
attorney
carrye
washington
of
ontario
disagreed
its
the
federal
government
that
is
properly
trained
to
know
the
immigration
laws
and
any
time
state
police
groups
decide
they
should
regulate
or
do
something
to
an
immigrant
it
seems
they
are
doing
something
that
is
not
constitutional
she
said
whether
states
and
localities
have
inherent
authority
to
enforce
civil
immigration
laws
is
an
open
question
said
marshall
fitz
associate
director
of
advocacy
for
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
the
understanding
prior
to
2002
was
that
they
do
not
he
said
in
2002
however
the
department
of
justice
issued
a
memo
reversing
that
interpretation
but
has
never
made
that
document
public
if
it
did
become
an
issue
that
was
litigated
the
federal
government
in
all
likelihood
would
not
side
with
the
individuals
challenging
the
policy
fitz
said
they
would
probably
weigh
in
on
the
side
of
the
state
of
california
but
thats
not
totally
clear
though
because
of
its
scope
haynes
proposal
could
be
challenged
by
the
federal
government
if
approved
by
voters
he
added
since
sept
11
2001
the
federal
government
has
been
trying
to
enlist
the
states
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
said
charles
doskow
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
la
verne
college
of
law
in
ontario
i
have
no
question
that
it
would
be
sustained
that
federal
law
enforcement
would
welcome
it
because
they
are
trying
to
identify
possible
terrorists
doskow
said
they
regard
illegal
aliens
as
one
of
those
sources
haynes
measure
once
titled
and
summarized
by
the
state
attorney
general
would
have
to
gain
nearly
600000
valid
signatures
to
be
put
on
the
june
2006
ballot
the
california
border
police
initiative
is
being
backed
by
rescue
california
which
gathered
more
than
14
million
signatures
to
recall
