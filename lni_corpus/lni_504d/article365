more
than
most
issues
immigration
is
characterized
by
a
wide
gap
between
elite
and
nonelite
opinion
while
poll
after
poll
has
for
years
demonstrated
overwhelming
majority
support
for
curtailing
immigration
our
political
and
economic
leaders
have
just
as
consistently
held
the
opposite
view
and
the
elites
have
prevailed
at
least
in
the
sense
that
since
the
overhaul
of
our
immigration
laws
in
the
mid1960s
legal
immigration
has
steadily
increased
from
about
297000
in
1965
to
over
720000
in
1995
with
a
net
annual
addition
of
300000
to
400000
illegal
immigrants
todays
influx
is
equivalent
in
absolute
numbers
if
not
as
a
percentage
of
total
population
to
the
historically
high
levels
immediately
preceding
world
war
i
does
this
mean
that
our
immigration
policy
simply
reflects
the
efforts
of
manipulative
and
deceitful
elites
flouting
majority
opinion
many
americans
seem
to
think
this
way
so
do
the
authors
of
two
new
books
that
challenge
this
elite
proimmigration
consensus
in
two
very
different
ways
one
of
these
books
is
an
utter
failure
the
other
an
earnest
but
flawed
effort
yet
both
bring
a
message
from
the
heartland
that
deserves
to
be
heard
chilton
williamson
jr
a
former
literary
editor
for
national
review
is
currently
the
wyomingbased
senior
editor
for
chronicles
a
monthly
out
of
rockford
ill
that
has
for
years
been
articulating
a
cranky
but
provocative
homegrown
conservatism
in
the
immigration
mystique
americas
false
conscience
williamson
starts
off
with
a
resounding
critique
of
the
prevailing
tendency
to
reduce
immigration
to
a
question
of
economics
as
he
forcefully
puts
it
nearly
everyone
recognizes
immigration
as
a
moral
dilemma
too
present
to
be
ignored
too
significant
to
be
fudged
yet
because
it
is
an
issue
of
moral
as
well
as
of
practical
complexity
too
many
people
having
allowed
themselves
to
become
paralyzed
morally
and
therefore
intellectually
fudge
it
anyway
unfortunately
williamson
engages
in
some
fudging
of
his
own
to
be
sure
he
scores
some
points
against
the
proimmigration
bias
of
many
journalists
who
seem
incapable
of
writing
about
the
issue
in
other
than
heartwrenching
humaninterest
terms
he
also
astutely
identifies
the
relevant
contradiction
at
the
heart
of
our
political
culture
precisely
because
we
idealize
america
as
a
haven
for
those
fleeing
other
nations
we
constantly
fear
its
being
corrupted
by
the
rest
of
the
world
finally
williamson
usefully
traces
out
the
connections
between
proimmigration
elites
and
their
postwar
view
of
americas
world
leadership
role
though
from
his
perspective
that
role
is
an
illconsidered
temptation
to
empire
that
has
undermined
our
republican
traditions
but
aside
from
these
insights
williamson
wanders
aimlessly
for
200
pages
getting
his
facts
wrong
and
making
outrageous
assertions
at
one
point
he
faults
americans
during
the
1920s
for
responding
automatically
and
indiscriminately
to
novelties
among
them
hot
dogs
spaghetti
pizza
and
oriental
food
theres
a
good
critique
of
an
establishment
proimmigration
position
to
be
made
but
this
book
doesnt
come
close
to
making
it
roy
becks
the
case
against
immigration
comes
closer
but
falls
short
where
williamson
is
the
disaffected
literary
intellectual
beck
is
the
policywonkish
journalist
like
williamson
beck
selfconsciously
hails
from
the
heartland
and
is
very
much
a
populist
who
sees
the
rich
benefiting
from
immigration
at
the
expense
of
ordinary
working
americans
his
1994
atlantic
article
about
the
negative
impacts
of
immigration
on
the
small
town
of
wausau
wis
was
widely
cited
as
an
editor
of
the
social
contract
a
quarterly
journal
linked
with
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
beck
has
direct
ties
with
the
principal
restrictionist
lobby
yet
despite
such
advocacy
roots
beck
is
a
reasonably
reliable
guide
through
a
mounting
body
of
evidence
on
the
problems
generated
by
immigration
for
example
he
shrewdly
identifies
a
connection
between
immigration
and
the
emergence
of
gated
communities
he
also
marshals
the
latest
research
indicating
that
up
to
a
third
of
americas
troubling
economic
inequality
is
traceable
to
immigration
moreover
beck
adroitly
supplements
such
statistical
findings
with
case
studies
of
how
immigrants
have
transformed
industries
once
dominated
by
nativeborn
americans
such
as
meat
packing
and
poultry
processing
always
balanced
and
never
strident
beck
argues
persuasively
that
immigration
is
a
relevant
but
not
necessarily
primary
factor
in
many
of
our
economic
and
social
problems
perhaps
most
cogent
is
his
discussion
of
the
negative
impacts
immigration
has
had
historically
and
contemporaneously
on
black
americans
yet
beck
goes
astray
when
he
attributes
the
breakdown
of
urban
infrastructure
including
the
need
to
replace
washingtons
woodrow
wilson
bridge
to
immigration
induced
population
growth
holding
up
boulder
colos
slowgrowth
zoning
as
a
model
for
the
nation
beck
doesnt
seem
to
recognize
that
such
uppermiddleclass
strategies
collide
with
his
populism
excluding
less
affluent
nativeborn
americans
never
mind
struggling
immigrants
such
strained
arguments
succeed
only
in
reminding
us
that
the
environmental
and
populationcontrol
movements
not
organized
labor
or
advocates
for
the
poor
have
been
important
spawning
grounds
for
antiimmigration
activists
similarly
beck
goes
too
far
when
he
argues
for
a
drastic
reduction
in
the
number
of
immigrants
admitted
down
to
250000
annually
and
asserts
that
legal
immigration
could
be
stopped
with
a
simple
majority
vote
of
congress
and
a
stroke
of
the
presidents
pen
in
fact
we
have
already
had
a
test
of
this
proposition
in
1965
congress
terminated
the
bracero
program
under
which
thousands
of
contract
laborers
had
been
brought
here
from
mexico
yet
despite
that
legislative
action
mexican
laborers
continued
to
pour
across
the
border
only
illegally
the
lesson
is
that
immigration
is
an
entrenched
economic
and
social
process
that
cannot
be
so
easily
legislated
out
of
existence
beck
stumbles
again
when
he
observes
that
high
immigration
almost
always
has
reflected
the
values
and
served
the
interests
of
a
small
elite
at
the
expense
of
the
national
interest
yet
the
values
he
refers
to
pervade
this
society
americans
esteem
individual
liberty
which
in
this
context
means
that
we
have
consistently
rejected
policies
that
would
provide
the
secure
means
of
identification
necessary
for
employers
as
well
as
public
officials
to
determine
an
individuals
immigration
status
without
such
measures
we
will
never
get
a
handle
on
our
immigration
problems
but
our
failure
to
do
so
cannot
be
blamed
solely
on
elite
opinion
however
reflexive
and
simpleminded
its
proimmigration
bias
may
be
when
it
comes
to
immigration
theres
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
