the
state
of
washington
has
issued
following
press
release
across
washington
immigrants
looking
for
the
right
to
live
and
work
legally
in
our
state
are
unknowingly
risking
their
futures
the
washington
attorney
generals
office
announced
10
new
settlements
today
with
individuals
accused
of
illegally
practicing
immigration
law
a
legal
area
so
complicated
that
one
wrong
step
can
drastically
delay
citizenship
or
completely
ruin
a
familys
chance
to
pursue
the
american
dream
too
many
immigration
assistants
who
have
no
legal
training
whatsoever
appear
to
offer
a
helping
hand
while
reaching
into
immigrants
wallets
attorney
general
rob
mckenna
said
the
attorney
generals
consumer
protection
division
took
enforcement
action
in
four
other
cases
last
year
and
is
currently
investigating
more
than
two
dozen
other
immigration
assistants
out
of
concern
that
these
individuals
are
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
immigration
law
the
attorney
general
is
also
tackling
this
issue
on
the
legislative
front
abuse
is
so
widespread
that
i
believe
the
best
solution
is
to
repeal
washingtons
outdated
immigration
assistant
practices
act
and
replace
it
with
legislation
that
truly
protects
consumers
from
harm
mckenna
said
the
bill
ive
proposed
this
year
ensures
that
only
qualified
individuals
provide
these
important
services
at
the
request
of
the
attorney
general
state
legislators
are
considering
amending
the
immigration
assistant
practices
act
to
allow
only
licensed
attorneys
and
those
authorized
under
federal
law
to
assist
consumers
with
immigration
matters
unlike
other
professional
designations
in
washington
the
current
law
does
not
require
that
persons
wishing
to
work
as
immigration
assistants
demonstrate
that
they
have
any
training
or
experience
in
immigration
matters
substitute
senate
bill
5023
sponsored
by
sen
margarita
prentice
dseattle
passed
out
of
the
house
rules
committee
on
march
31
and
is
expected
to
receive
a
floor
vote
if
signed
into
law
ssb
5023
would
be
one
of
the
strongest
laws
of
its
kind
in
the
united
states
the
bill
has
support
from
many
immigration
attorneys
and
immigrant
rights
organizations
including
the
northwest
immigrant
rights
project
and
oneamerica
immigration
attorneys
around
the
state
have
also
applauded
the
bill
the
attorney
generals
proposal
would
eliminate
the
immigration
assistant
designation
from
the
current
law
and
increase
the
availability
of
court
remedies
for
those
harmed
by
the
activities
of
persons
holding
themselves
out
as
having
special
skills
in
immigration
law
the
bill
wouldnt
affect
individuals
nonprofit
organizations
or
law
school
clinics
authorized
to
provide
immigration
related
services
under
federal
law
the
law
also
aims
to
address
the
problem
of
immigrant
assistants
who
take
advantage
of
the
linguistic
similarities
between
the
spanish
term
notario
publico
which
in
mexico
and
some
other
latin
american
countries
means
attorney
with
the
english
term
notary
public
which
implies
no
legal
expertise
whatsoever
under
the
bill
persons
who
work
as
notaries
public
would
be
prohibited
from
marketing
their
services
in
a
way
that
leads
consumers
to
believe
they
have
special
skills
in
immigration
law
