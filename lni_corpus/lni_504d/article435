solid
backgrounds
in
immigration
law

business
immigration
for
more
than
ten
years
and
andrew
blau
a
second
year
associate
rounds
out
the
group
editor
ted
you
mentioned
immigration
law
as
an
esoteric
specialty
how
did
you
come
to
it
ruthizer
i
really
fell
into
immigration
law
by
chance
in
the
mid1970s
i
was
engaged
in
appellate
work
i
joined
a
small
firm
that
handled
labor
law
matters
and
in
addition
an
unusual
specialty
involving
business
immigration
matters
very
few
firms
did
this
kind
of
work
my
initial
interest
was
in
the
employment
law
part
of
the
practice
but
as
time
went
on
i
became
increasingly
drawn
to
the
immigration
work
i
found
it
both
fascinating
and
challenging
it
also
provided
me
with
an
opportunity
to
help
people
in
a
very
direct
way
i
found
the
personal
interaction
very
rewarding
i
think
i
was
someone
who
found
himself
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
koestler
by
the
time
i
came
along
business
immigration
law
was
a
specialty
that
was
already
well
recognized
and
growing
in
importance
ted
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
join
him
in
this
area
and
we
have
worked
together
ever
since
editor
you
have
both
been
engaged
in
this
practice
for
a
considerable
time
will
you
tell
us
how
it
has
evolved
over
the
years
have
the
issues
you
have
addressed
changed
ruthizer
over
the
years
i
have
seen
several
major
changes
one
concerns
the
way
in
which
the
immigration
laws
are
administered
when
i
began
almost
everything
was
done
at
the
local
level
most
cases
were
handled
at
local
immigration
service
offices
scattered
across
the
country
and
to
a
very
large
extent
who
you
knew
at
those
offices
was
as
important
as
what
you
knew
about
the
law
fortunately
this
has
changed
dramatically
virtually
all
of
the
business
immigration
cases
that
we
handle
are
adjudicated
at
one
of
four
remote
regional
service
centers
the
agency
now
renamed
us
immigration
and
citizenship
services
has
a
higher
degree
of
professionalism
than
it
had
in
the
past
and
this
makes
a
business
immigration
lawyers
knowledge
of
the
law
paramount
the
other
major
developments
have
been
sweeping
changes
in
the
law
over
the
past
10
years
an
increasing
restrictiveness
by
immigration
officials
in
granting
benefits
and
the
challenge
of
interpreting
the
meaning
of
these
statutory
and
policy
changes
the
increasing
complexity
of
the
field
has
made
the
practice
of
immigration
law
a
minefield
for
the
unwary
and
the
uninformed
another
major
change
of
course
has
been
the
security
controls
that
have
been
put
into
place
since
september
11
making
it
far
more
difficult
for
foreign
nationals
to
obtain
visas
and
to
be
admitted
to
the
united
states
editor
where
is
this
particular
practice
concentrated
in
the
large
global
firms
in
boutiques
what
is
the
ideal
platform
for
this
type
of
practice
koestler
there
was
a
time
when
business
immigration
law
was
concentrated
for
the
most
part
in
boutiques
today
the
most
effective
platform
for
this
type
of
practice
is
the
large
general
practice
firm
one
with
expertise
across
many
different
practice
areas
business
immigration
law
interfaces
with
a
great
many
other
areas
in
the
law
and
an
ability
to
draw
upon
the
resources
of
a
large
sophisticated
general
practice
firm
such
as
kramer
levin
is
a
great
advantage
editor
you
are
bringing
a
very
experienced
practice
group
to
kramer
levin
how
did
you
choose
kramer
levin
as
the
new
home
for
the
group
ruthizer
we
identified
kramer
levin
as
being
the
best
fit
for
the
nature
of
our
practice
because
kramer
levin
has
such
a
strong
employment
law
practice
as
well
as
many
other
practice
areas
that
are
supportive
of
what
our
group
does
as
mark
indicates
the
synergies
are
there
and
not
only
with
the
employment
law
practice
but
also
with
an
entire
battery
of
disciplines
that
contribute
to
an
effective
business
immigration
practice
including
corporate
tax
employee
benefits
and
other
areas
that
interface
with
our
practice
and
not
only
is
kramer
levin
a
very
strong
presence
here
in
new
york
it
has
an
international
dimension
through
its
paris
office
and
its
strong
affiliations
with
two
prominent
uk
and
italian
law
firms
that
will
help
our
practice
grow
it
is
the
right
platform
for
us
and
we
believe
we
will
flourish
here
editor
please
tell
us
about
the
work
of
the
practice
group
for
starters
does
the
group
have
its
own
client
base
or
is
it
providing
a
service
to
the
firms
clients
koestler
we
bring
a
terrific
client
base
of
our
own
to
kramer
levin
and
we
have
already
begun
servicing
kramer
levin
clients
who
previously
had
to
go
elsewhere
for
this
work
the
groups
clients
include
a
number
of
major
communications
and
media
companies
many
of
the
countrys
leading
advertising
agencies
and
a
wide
range
of
financial
services
manufacturing
publishing
and
consumer
products
companies
the
entertainment
business
is
also
well
represented
the
client
base
is
quite
varied
and
we
expect
to
add
to
it
both
new
clients
and
new
types
of
clients
as
we
move
into
the
kramer
levin
fold
editor
how
big
is
the
group
and
how
does
it
operate
ruthizer
we
are
twelve
people
altogether
with
six
lawyers
with
kramer
levins
reputation
and
resources
we
certainly
expect
the
group
to
continue
to
grow
every
lawyer
in
the
group
is
a
business
immigration
lawyer
and
every
lawyer
is
closely
involved
with
each
case
we
do
we
reject
the
idea
that
immigration
work
can
be
handled
by
paralegals
with
only
minimal
lawyer
involvement
that
is
a
recipe
for
disaster
and
that
is
the
one
thing
that
really
distinguishes
us
from
other
immigration
practices
we
are
also
very
selective
of
the
kinds
of
matters
we
undertake
we
concentrate
exclusively
on
business
immigration
and
that
concentration
and
our
style
of
practice
enable
us
to
provide
the
best
possible
representation
to
our
clients
editor
you
are
dealing
with
a
number
of
governmental
agencies
on
an
ongoing
basis
are
these
relationships
part
of
the
value
your
group
brings
to
its
clients
ruthizer
we
deal
with
a
number
of
governmental
agencies
the
uscis
the
state
department
and
the
labor
department
and
it
is
simply
a
fact
of
life
that
being
able
to
get
to
the
right
person
to
review
a
decision
we
believe
is
incorrect
or
to
reexamine
a
policy
that
violates
the
spirit
or
language
of
a
statute
or
regulation
is
important
to
our
clients
we
are
a
known
quantity
in
governmental
circles
enjoying
a
reputation
for
high
quality
work
and
for
our
knowledge
of
the
law
and
of
the
policy
and
decisionmaking
processes
we
believe
strongly
in
engaging
in
a
wide
variety
of
activities
such
as
lecturing
and
writing
participating
in
meetings
with
key
governmental
officials
and
being
active
in
the
leading
professional
associations
that
contribute
to
our
having
credibility
with
the
governmental
agencies
involved
in
the
immigration
process
editor
would
you
tell
us
about
the
challenges
that
your
group
faces
i
am
thinking
in
particular
of
the
postseptember
11
climate
koestler
since
september
11
security
background
checks
are
much
tighter
that
means
that
lengthy
governmental
delays
are
now
the
order
of
the
day
and
this
requires
us
to
do
much
more
advance
planning
and
to
make
our
clients
understand
that
the
days
when
someone
could
drop
into
a
us
consulate
without
an
appointment
and
walk
out
a
few
minutes
later
with
a
visa
are
long
gone
ruthizer
as
a
consequence
of
tighter
security
following
september
11
we
are
dealing
with
issues
of
people
who
might
have
run
afoul
of
the
law
in
some
minor
way
decades
ago
and
with
a
record
now
in
the
immigration
database
finding
their
ability
to
enter
the
united
states
challenged
a
senior
business
executive
who
was
arrested
for
a
very
minor
charge
25
years
earlier
will
now
find
himself
denied
entry
and
literally
turned
away
at
the
airport
these
are
things
that
simply
did
not
happen
in
the
past
the
postseptember
11
climate
has
made
the
need
for
skilled
immigration
counsel
that
much
more
critical
editor
and
the
opportunities
in
a
world
in
which
globalization
appears
to
be
accelerating
your
practice
is
only
going
to
become
more
important
over
time
ruthizer
talent
is
found
all
over
the
world
and
the
search
for
talent
is
only
going
to
intensify
with
globalization
in
order
to
compete
effectively
companies
need
to
recruit
and
retain
that
talent
wherever
it
originates
it
is
that
talent
that
drives
the
engine
of
the
global
economy
but
at
the
same
time
globalization
of
the
workforce
is
a
hard
concept
to
sell
to
congress
and
business
immigration
remains
a
stepchild
abandoned
by
politicians
who
blame
unemployment
on
the
hiring
of
a
modest
number
of
highly
qualified
foreign
national
professionals
executives
and
managers
our
practice
group
is
well
positioned
to
help
companies
compete
in
this
challenging
environment
