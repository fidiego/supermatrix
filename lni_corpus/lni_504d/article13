should
local
police
contact
the
feds
whenever
they
arrest
a
crime
suspect
with
an
uncertain
immigration
status
the
illegal
immigrant
status
and
prior
record
of
at
least
one
suspect
in
the
killings
of
three
young
adults
in
newark
last
week
led
city
councilman
ron
c
rice
on
monday
to
call
for
a
resolution
requiring
city
police
to
contact
immigration
agents
when
a
felony
suspect
is
deemed
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
those
who
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
say
the
ability
of
murder
suspect
jose
carranza
an
illegal
immigrant
from
peru
to
roam
the
streets
before
the
killings
despite
pending
assault
and
childrape
charges
underscores
the
need
for
stepped
up
contact
between
local
authorities
and
immigration
agents
many
say
police
should
routinely
check
immigration
status
during
the
normal
course
of
their
work
but
advocates
for
immigrants
argue
that
the
killings
are
not
an
immigration
issue
and
expressed
concern
that
all
illegal
immigrants
would
be
stigmatized
as
potential
killers
this
was
a
heinous
crime
and
these
suspects
have
deep
psychological
issues
said
gustavo
ramirez
head
of
the
passaicbased
immigration
and
american
citizenship
organization
this
crime
however
cannot
be
explained
by
immigration
status
any
more
than
terrorism
can
be
morristown
mayor
donald
cresitello
who
wants
his
towns
police
to
be
deputized
as
immigration
agents
says
the
involvement
of
immigration
officials
after
an
arrest
helps
keep
dangerous
criminals
off
the
streets
cresitello
said
that
if
the
socalled
287g
the
federal
program
that
deputizes
local
and
state
police
to
enforce
immigration
matters
had
been
in
place
in
newark
and
essex
county
carranza
most
likely
would
have
remained
in
custody
after
previous
arrests
on
assault
and
rape
charges
with
287g
you
get
an
immigration
detainer
placed
against
him
and
hes
not
permitted
out
of
the
jail
cresitello
said
i
dont
know
why
anyone
would
be
against
this
program
carranza
28
had
been
freed
on
bail
this
year
on
charges
of
aggravated
assault
related
to
a
barroom
fight
and
31
counts
of
aggravated
sexual
assault
of
a
child
and
endangering
the
welfare
of
a
child
last
week
he
and
four
other
suspects
including
minors
are
alleged
to
have
killed
three
college
students
in
executionstyle
shootings
one
of
the
suspects
a
15yearold
who
essex
county
officials
say
is
a
legal
us
resident
was
arrested
last
week
in
morristown
carranza
has
pleaded
not
guilty
to
charges
of
firstdegree
murder
attempted
murder
and
robbery
authorities
with
the
essex
county
prosecutors
office
say
they
typically
do
not
contact
immigration
authorities
about
an
illegal
immigrant
until
after
the
defendant
is
convicted
thats
been
the
policy
said
executive
assistant
prosecutor
charlotte
smith
but
we
ask
for
the
passport
to
be
seized
and
no
contact
with
victims
one
published
report
attributed
the
reason
for
the
policy
to
a
concern
by
essex
county
authorities
that
defendants
would
be
deported
before
they
could
be
punished
smith
said
she
could
not
immediately
confirm
that
concern
as
the
reason
for
the
policy
immigration
authorities
say
that
essex
county
authorities
did
not
alert
them
about
carranza
until
last
week
we
have
no
record
relating
to
any
of
his
previous
arrests
said
marc
raimondi
a
spokesman
for
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
in
the
event
that
we
are
contacted
regarding
an
illegal
alien
who
is
accused
of
a
violent
crime
or
rape
of
a
child
we
will
put
them
at
the
top
of
our
priority
list
raimondi
said
that
immigration
authorities
generally
wait
until
after
a
defendant
has
served
his
or
her
sentence
before
moving
to
deport
them
but
he
said
that
immigration
does
have
the
power
to
keep
an
illegal
immigrant
from
being
freed
on
bail
pending
the
resolution
of
a
case
whats
more
he
said
immigration
authorities
still
can
deport
a
defendant
who
has
been
acquitted
bill
maer
spokesman
for
the
passaic
county
sheriffs
department
said
the
department
performs
checks
on
individuals
who
enter
its
custody
if
there
is
an
immigration
issue
he
said
the
immigration
agency
is
alerted
but
it
is
up
to
federal
authorities
to
decide
if
theyre
going
to
take
action
its
not
our
place
to
enforce
immigration
law
its
ices
job
we
just
fulfill
our
obligation
to
notify
them
when
an
issue
arises
he
said
immigration
advocates
generally
condemn
tight
partnerships
between
local
police
and
immigration
agents
out
of
fear
that
such
bonds
will
lead
to
abuse
of
civil
rights
they
also
believe
that
if
local
and
county
authorities
are
viewed
as
quasiimmigration
agents
immigrants
will
be
reluctant
to
come
forward
as
crime
victims
or
witnesses
we
should
not
move
to
deport
someone
just
because
they
have
been
accused
said
ramirez
the
immigrant
advocate
people
can
be
and
often
are
wrongly
accused
and
we
should
give
them
their
day
in
court
after
theyve
been
found
guilty
of
something
horrible
then
lets
punish
them
and
bring
in
immigration
and
deport
them
for
his
part
rice
who
is
pushing
for
the
immigration
resolution
in
newark
said
he
does
not
want
his
proposal
to
be
seen
as
a
call
to
arms
against
illegal
immigrants
i
want
to
address
the
problem
of
getting
people
off
the
streets
like
jose
carranza
he
said
i
dont
want
to
deputize
local
police
officers
i
think
that
goes
too
far
i
dont
want
racial
profiling
