a
proposal
that
would
have
implemented
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
in
nebraska
appears
doomed
for
this
year
the
legislatures
judiciary
committee
decided
wednesday
not
to
advance
any
immigration
bills
this
session
for
debate
by
the
legislature
instead
the
committee
plans
an
omnibus
interim
study
this
summer
to
look
at
how
best
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
including
a
plan
being
tried
in
utah
that
would
allow
undocumented
workers
to
get
work
permits
we
have
a
duty
to
do
a
thorough
investigation
of
this
issue
said
committee
chairman
brad
ashford
of
omaha
and
we
are
going
to
do
it
the
arizonastyle
bill
lb48
by
sen
charlie
janssen
of
fremont
would
require
police
officers
who
stop
or
arrest
a
person
to
check
whether
he
or
she
is
in
the
country
legally
if
the
officers
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
think
otherwise
those
who
cannot
prove
they
are
here
legally
would
be
held
and
federal
immigration
authorities
would
be
notified
janssen
said
he
is
disappointed
his
bill
appears
stalled
for
the
session
but
is
grateful
the
committee
is
going
to
study
the
issue
im
happy
about
the
fact
that
we
are
looking
at
doing
something
he
said
people
are
here
illegally
and
we
need
to
enforce
our
federal
immigration
laws
the
utah
plan
would
allow
the
state
to
grant
work
permits
to
illegal
immigrants
who
undergo
criminal
background
checks
among
other
things
it
also
requires
republican
gov
gary
herbert
to
seek
a
federal
waiver
because
it
is
illegal
under
federal
law
to
hire
illegal
immigrants
meanwhile
utah
attorney
general
mark
shurtleff
announced
this
week
that
he
is
talking
with
officials
in
the
mexican
state
of
nuevo
leon
to
create
a
socalled
guestworker
program
to
establish
a
flow
of
legal
workers
in
utah
thats
a
very
powerful
idea
ashford
said
marissa
graciosa
director
the
fair
immigration
reform
movement
hailed
the
utah
effort
utahs
bills
are
concrete
proof
that
the
country
does
not
want
more
arizonas
she
said
the
country
has
never
had
an
appetite
for
solving
the
immigration
crisis
through
deportation
americans
understand
what
politicians
are
slowly
admitting
through
policy
the
country
benefits
economically
and
culturally
from
the
contributions
of
immigrants
even
in
arizona
moving
punitive
bills
out
of
committee
has
met
resistance
janssen
said
he
has
not
studied
the
utah
plan
they
are
saying
maybe
the
states
should
have
something
to
do
with
this
janssen
said
i
want
enforcement
to
be
part
of
any
type
of
meaningful
immigration
reform
something
needs
to
be
done
the
utah
plan
includes
a
provision
requiring
that
police
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
arrested
for
serious
misdemeanors
and
felonies
by
some
estimates
about
45000
illegal
immigrants
live
in
nebraska
and
11
million
live
in
the
united
states
the
us
department
of
justice
has
filed
suit
challenging
the
arizona
law
arguing
that
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
is
a
federal
responsibility
ashford
agreed
this
is
complicated
stuff
that
we
shouldnt
even
have
to
be
dealing
with
he
said
the
federal
government
should
be
dealing
with
it
janssen
whom
some
consider
to
be
the
most
aggressive
antiillegal
immigration
senator
in
the
legislature
worked
with
nebraska
attorney
general
jon
brunings
office
to
craft
the
bill
modeled
after
the
arizona
law
which
they
tweaked
to
try
to
protect
nebraska
from
some
of
the
same
legal
challenges
while
supporters
of
janssens
measure
say
its
a
fair
way
to
curb
illegal
immigration
opponents
say
such
legislation
cant
be
enforced
without
racial
profiling
mainly
against
hispanics
ashford
said
solving
the
illegal
immigration
problem
is
incredibly
important
for
our
state
we
need
to
build
a
statewide
consensus
we
need
to
embrace
the
productivity
of
the
immigrant
population
even
if
they
are
undocumented
in
a
way
that
citizens
fully
understand
and
so
the
taxes
can
be
paid
and
these
people
can
have
insurance
he
said
this
needs
to
be
done
thoughtfully
