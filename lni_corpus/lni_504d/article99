the
supreme
court
yesterday
finally
handed
down
its
decision
on
one
of
the
most
highly
anticipated
issues
on
the
docket
in
arizona
et
al
v
united
states
the
high
court
struck
down
the
three
harshest
parts
of
the
nations
strictest
and
most
controversial
immigration
law
which
was
signed
into
law
by
arizona

arizonas
support
our

and

act
sb
1070
went
beyond
the
us
federal
law
requiring
all
aliens
over
the
age
of
14
who
are
in
the
us
longer
than
14
days
to
have
registration
documents
in
their
possession
at
all
times
by
making
it
a
state
misdemeanor
crime
for
not
having
the
proper
paperwork
the
law
also
requires
state
police
officers
to
attempt
to
ascertain
a
persons
immigration
status
during
lawful
stops
or
arrests
or
lawful
conduct
when
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
an
illegal
immigrant
additionally
sb
1070
prevents
state
or
local
officials
and
agencies
from
restricting
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
and
cracks
down
on
people
who
hire
transport
or
shelter
illegals
after
the
law
spent
more
than
two
years
in
the
spotlight
the
supreme
court
mostly
sided
with
the
laws
critics
ruling
that
the
state
of
arizona
interfered
with
congressional
authority
over
us
borders
by
a
vote
of
62
the
high
court
nullified
the
provision
making
it
a
state
crime
for
immigrants
to
not
carry
federal
registration
papers
by
a
vote
of
53
the
court
also
voided
sections
of
the
law
that
sanctioned
jail
time
for
illegal
immigrants
who
are
searching
for
work
in
arizona
and
that
gave
state
and
local
police
additional
powers
to
arrest
immigrants
suspected
of
offenses
however
the
high
court
did
let
stand
the
provision
requiring
police
to
check
immigration
status
of
people
they
stop
given
that
federal
law
already
requires
immigration
authorities
to
respond
to
state
and
local
officers
inquiries
the
court
saw
no
problem
with
the
provision
the
court
did
leave
some
room
for
a
possible
challenge
to
this
provision
though
should
it
lead
to
overlong
detention
of
people
solely
to
check
immigration
status
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
broad
undoubted
power
over
the
subject
of
immigration

the
status

aliens

of

justice

agreed
with
the
majority
that
the

was
invalid

provisions
to
make

justices
