phoenix
office
of
the
legislative
the
state
of
arizona
has
issued
the
following
bill
a
resolution
supporting
reasonable
and
humane
principles
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
text
of
bill
begins
on
next
page
whereas
the
federal
government
has
the
exclusive
authority
to
develop
implement
and
enforce
immigration
policy
under
the
united
states
constitution
the
regulation
of
immigration
is
solely
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
government
and
the
courts
have
consistently
applied
this
principle
to
mandate
federal
preemption
of
state
and
local
efforts
to
regulate
immigration
moreover
the
enactment
of
immigration
laws
by
state
and
local
governments
such
as
arizonas
senate
bill
1070
produces
an
incoherent
and
inconsistent
patchwork
of
policies
that
undermine
the
effective
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
policy
and
whereas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
strengthen
our
national
security
and
the
public
safety
of
our
communities
and
neighborhoods
the
united
states
has
the
right
of
every
sovereign
nation
to
secure
its
borders
through
laws
that
regulate
the
entry
of
persons
from
other
countries
we
must
provide
resources
for
immigration
enforcement
and
implement
enforcement
measures
that
will
accomplish
these
goals
in
an
effective
and
humane
manner
the
implementation
of
resources
must
be
used
in
accordance
with
respect
to
human
and
civil
rights
in
addition
policymakers
must
not
impose
ineffective
or
unrealistic
requirements
for
the
achievement
of
immigration
enforcement
goals
as
a
precondition
to
implementing
the
other
components
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
whereas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
provide
immigrant
workers
and
their
families
with
an
opportunity
to
pursue
united
states
citizenship
currently
there
are
millions
of
immigrants
who
have
been
here
for
several
years
and
who
pay
taxes
raise
families
and
contribute
to
their
communities
including
many
who
do
not
yet
have
authorized
immigration
status
it
is
essential
that
our
immigration
policy
recognizes
the
contributions
of
these
community
members
by
providing
an
opportunity
to
obtain
legal
permanent
residency
and
eventually
a
path
to
united
states
citizenship
through
a
program
with
fair
and
reasonable
requirements
and
whereas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
policies
must
help
reunite
families
and
reduce
immigration
backlogs
currently
large
immigration
backlogs
prevent
many
united
states
citizens
from
swiftly
reuniting
with
their
family
members
it
is
important
that
our
immigration
policies
recognize
the
efforts
of
individuals
who
have
petitioned
for
loved
ones
through
legal
channels
and
that
we
institute
measures
to
ensure
family
reunification
and
a
substantive
reduction
of
the
family
backlogs
and
whereas
any
temporary
worker
program
must
provide
workers
with
full
labor
and
civil
rights
protections
and
the
opportunity
to
pursue
legal
permanent
residency
in
the
united
states
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
seek
to
improve
the
conditions
for
migrant
and
seasonal
workers
many
of
whom
work
in
agricultural
jobs
if
these
conditions
are
addressed
through
a
temporary
worker
program
it
must
provide
labor
and
wage
protections
and
an
opportunity
for
workers
to
pursue
legal
permanent
residency
in
particular
we
must
provide
temporary
workers
with
full
labor
and
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
organize
the
right
to
change
jobs
and
the
right
to
remain
with
their
families
and
must
vigorously
enforce
these
rights
and
whereas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
provide
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
immigrant
students
to
pursue
a
college
education
and
the
passing
of
the
dream
act
must
be
central
to
any
legislation
currently
thousands
of
undocumented
immigrant
students
that
were
brought
to
the
united
states
at
a
young
age
face
significant
barriers
when
they
try
to
obtain
a
postsecondary
education
these
students
many
of
whom
excelled
in
high
school
lack
access
to
the
financial
aid
and
employment
opportunities
needed
to
pursue
higher
education
these
students
are
an
important
part
of
our
future
workforce
and
their
pursuit
of
higher
education
will
make
our
nation
more
productive
and
competitive
in
the
global
economy
and
whereas
immigration
policies
must
actively
promote
the
civic
integration
of
migrants
many
migrants
face
significant
barriers
when
the
attempt
to
acquire
the
skills
needed
to
participate
in
our
nations
civic
life
those
who
wish
to
pursue
english
language
learning
ell
and
civics
instruction
often
face
waiting
lists
or
crowded
classrooms
comprehensive
immigration
reform
provides
a
critical
opportunity
to
promote
ell
and
civics
instruction
and
make
more
resources
available
for
adult
education
services
further
immigration
policies
must
ensure
that
the
naturalization
process
is
fair
and
accessible
for
all
we
oppose
any
efforts
that
would
create
unfair
obstacles
for
naturalization
applicants
including
high
application
fees
or
other
costs
that
put
united
states
citizenship
beyond
the
reach
of
middle
and
lowincome
legal
permanent
residents
we
also
oppose
measures
that
would
jeopardize
the
due
process
rights
of
applicants
or
make
unfair
changes
in
the
english
and
civics
proficiency
requirements
for
united
states
citizenship
and
whereas
our
nations
security
and
public
safety
are
best
protected
by
effective
and
fair
immigration
enforcement
measures
our
immigration
enforcement
policies
must
not
diminish
the
due
process
rights
afforded
to
our
nations
residents
including
united
states
citizens
legal
permanent
residents
or
undocumented
individuals
and
whereas
we
oppose
measures
that
make
undocumented
presence
in
the
united
states
a
crime
including
measures
that
would
make
millions
of
undocumented
individuals
into
criminals
and
virtually
prevent
them
from
ever
obtaining
legal
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states
our
nation
would
be
required
to
expend
a
significant
amount
of
resources
to
carry
out
these
measures
including
the
deployment
of
enforcement
officials
prosecutors
judges
and
courtappointed
counsel
and
the
expansion
of
detention
facilities
ultimately
measures
that
criminalize
undocumented
presence
cannot
be
fully
enforced
and
our
nation
would
squander
resources
that
could
be
better
used
for
pressing
public
safety
and
security
concerns
and
whereas
we
oppose
the
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
by
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
many
of
these
agencies
have
worked
hard
to
establish
relationships
of
trust
with
local
immigrant
communities
which
is
undermined
by
immigration
enforcement
activities
as
a
result
community
members
are
fearful
of
reporting
crimes
or
cooperating
with
local
police
preventing
law
enforcement
from
obtaining
the
information
they
need
to
solve
crimes
combat
terrorism
and
keep
our
communities
and
neighborhoods
safe
and
whereas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
include
a
discussion
of
the
fundamental
cause
of
migration
to
the
united
statesthe
need
for
sustainable
social
and
economic
development
in
the
communities
where
migrants
originate
our
nation
must
more
actively
pursue
partnership
opportunities
with
sending
nations
to
determine
feasible
development
strategies
that
would
enable
them
to
better
meet
the
economic
needs
of
their
population
therefore
be
it
resolved
by
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
support
the
principles
stated
in
this
resolution
as
a
reasonable
and
humane
approach
to
comprehensive
immigration
reform
