congress
must
ensure
that
the

dont
devolve
into
a
repeat
of
1996
immigration
reform
that
became
overkill
against
immigrants
and
immigration
since

we
have
learned
how
deeply
vulnerable
our

although
some
overstayed

however
our

must
not

that
those
who
would
do

harm
are
an
aberration
among
the
millions
who
visit
our
country
annually
its
of
no
benefit
to
foster
a
culture
of
suspicion
of
foreigners
the
vast
majority
of
whom
return

a
positive
impression
of
america
and
its
people
we
only
hurt
ourselves
when
we
limit
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
unreasonably
deprive
the
global
community
of
opportunities

about
us
whether
in

or

our
homes
