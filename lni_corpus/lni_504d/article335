a
former
diplomat
has
set
up
the
countrys
first
pressure
group
against
largescale
immigration
sir
andrew
green
who
was
ambassador
to
saudi
arabia
and
syria
has
formed
migration
watch
uk
to
raise
awareness
about
the
shortcomings
of
the
immigration
system
and
the
economic
social
and
environmental
consequences
of
the
present
record
levels
of
immigration
the
group
will
seek
to
counter
organisations
such
as
the
refugee
council
and
the
immigration
advisory
service
which
oppose
any
tightening
of
immigration
rules
the
main
concern
is
the
sheer
scale
of
immigration
to
the
uk
which
will
bring
in
at
least
two
million
people
over
the
next
ten
years
including
a
low
estimate
for
the
illegals
sir
andrew
said
two
thirds
of
them
are
going
to
london
and
the
south
east
already
one
of
the
most
crowded
areas
in
europe
we
are
concerned
about
what
it
may
portend
for
our
society
as
a
whole
immigration
is
at
its
highest
level
since
records
began
with
more
than
180000
newcomers
in
both
1999
and
2000
the
influx
is
quadrupling
the
growth
rate
of
the
population
and
will
ensure
it
carries
on
growing
for
at
least
the
next
half
century
raising
it
from
60
million
to
about
70
million
the
government
has
forecast
that
immigration
will
continue
at
135000
a
year
the
home
office
has
said
that
britain
needs
150000
immigrants
a
year
almost
all
will
be
members
of
ethnic
minorities
in
this
country
and
of
these
80
per
cent
vote
labour
england
has
383
people
per
square
kilometre
making
it
almost
twice
as
crowded
as
germany
227
peoplesq
km
almost
four
times
as
crowded
as
france
105sq
km
and
about
12
times
as
densely
populated
as
the
united
states
29sq
km
the
pressure
group
based
on
the
website
migrationwatchukorg
is
working
with
demographers
and
economists
to
highlight
the
consequences
of
largescale
immigration
one
of
its
first
papers
highlights
the
economic
costs
such
as
reducing
the
wages
of
native
workers
and
pushing
up
unemployment
it
points
to
flaws
in
the
governments
calculation
that
migrants
pay
pounds
25
billion
more
in
taxes
than
they
receive
in
services
since
the
calculation
does
not
take
into
account
that
more
facilities
have
to
be
built
as
the
population
is
pushed
up
for
example
the
greater
london
authority
estimates
that
130
schools
will
need
to
be
built
in
the
next
decade
to
accommodate
the
children
of
immigrants
the
supposed
economic
and
cultural
advantages
of
immigration
are
promoted
by
government
and
others
but
they
never
mention
its
effect
on
population
size
and
growth
said
david
coleman
reader
in
demography
at
oxford
university
and
an
adviser
to
migration
watch
uk
britain
has
not
had
an
antiimmigration
pressure
group
before
although
they
thrive
in
america
where
immigration
is
running
at
a
slightly
higher
level
proportionate
to
the
population
there
are
groups
such
as
balance
and
sierrans
for
us
population
stablisation
which
campaigns
against
largescale
immigration
from
an
environmental
perspective
the
diversity
alliance
for
a
sustainable
america
is
made
up
of
nonwhite
americans
who
claim
that
ethnic
minorities
also
suffer
from
immigration
sir
andrew
has
tried
to
make
sure
that
no
one
can
accuse
migration
watch
uk
of
being
a
racist
organisation
its
not
racism
its
realism
he
said
its
right
in
a
democracy
that
the
public
have
the
facts
we
avoided
being
a
movement
because
it
could
get
taken
over
by
unwelcome
elements
and
we
have
no
links
with
political
parties
he
said
that
once
the
public
were
aware
of
the
facts
and
consequences
of
immigration
they
should
be
allowed
to
decide
on
what
policies
to
take
if
once
people
are
aware
of
the
facts
and
they
give
their
assent
to
largescale
immigration
then
that
is
the
right
result
of
the
democratic
process
surveys
have
consistently
shown
that
the
majority
of
the
public
opposes
largescale
immigration
a
recent
poll
for
the
commission
for
racial
equality
found
that
61
per
cent
of
the
population
including
46
per
cent
of
ethnic
minorities
think
that
britain
is
accepting
too
many
immigrants
