the
senate
on
tuesday
rejected
adding
two
guestworker
provisions
to
the
emergency
iraq
spending
bill
postponing
what
is
likely
to
be
a
protracted
and
contentious
debate
over
immigration
in
the
coming
months
setting
aside
the
immigration
debate
then
paved
the
way
for
the
senate
to
vote
unanimously
to
cut
off
debate
on
the
overall
80
billionplus
spending
measure
that
means
a
final
vote
on
that
bill
could
come
this
week
both
sides
in
the
immigration
debate
had
their
own
spins
on
tuesdays
actions
sen
larry
craig
author
of
the
agjobs
bill
noted
that
while
he
couldnt
get
the
required
60
votes
to
force
a
vote
on
his
bill
a
majority
did
support
his
idea
to
create
a
new
farmworker
program
that
would
give
illegal
immigrants
a
path
to
permanent
us
residency
a
majority
of
my
colleagues
sent
a
strong
message
today
that
they
support
agjobs
and
are
ready
to
address
immigration
reform
said
craig
ridaho
after
the
vote
opponents
of
any
immigration
reform
took
solace
in
the
senates
rejection
of
both
craigs
plan
and
an
alternative
that
would
have
created
a
guestworker
program
but
without
any
path
to
legalization
for
undocumented
workers
the
real
winners
tuesday
were
those
senators
who
wanted
to
see
the
immigration
debate
put
off
and
handled
through
the
regular
committee
process
and
president
george
w
bush
who
is
also
seeking
comprehensive
immigration
reform
sen
john
cornyn
rtexas
chairman
of
the
senates
immigration
subcommittee
and
sen
dianne
feinstein
dcalif
have
been
pushing
all
week
to
put
off
the
immigration
debate
cornyn
is
in
the
midst
of
a
series
of
immigration
hearings
and
hopes
to
introduce
a
wideranging
immigration
bill
by
this
summer
senate
leaders
also
didnt
want
to
include
immigration
provisions
in
the
iraq
spending
bill
knowing
that
adding
such
elements
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
get
an
agreement
on
the
final
spending
bill
with
the
house
when
both
spending
bills
are
passed
both
sides
will
still
have
to
agree
on
what
to
do
with
the
real
id
act
a
measure
the
house
added
to
its
version
of
the
bill
the
fate
of
that
provision
which
would
effectively
ban
illegal
immigrants
from
getting
drivers
licenses
as
well
as
tightening
asylum
laws
and
mandating
completion
of
a
border
fence
at
otay
mesa
will
be
decided
by
a
conference
committee
