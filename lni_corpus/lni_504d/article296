words
when
the
senate
resumes
debate
next
week
over
immigration
reforms
much
of
the
attention
will
be
devoted
to
politically
charged
proposals
to
deal
with
illegal
workers
and
stepping
up
border
security
but
buried
deep
in
the
immigration
legislation
is
a
sweeping
plan
that
could
make
it
much
tougher
for
immigrants
fighting
deportation
and
refugees
seeking
asylum
to
press
their
case
in
the
federal
appeals
courts
those
courts
in
recent
years
have
been
the
chief
safety
net
for
catching
mistakes
in
the
immigration
system
and
with
congress
preoccupied
by
political
warfare
over
undocumented
workers
and
border
controls
the
changes
to
the
legal
system
are
sliding
through
with
scant
public
debate
most
troubling
to
immigration
rights
advocates
is
one
provision
that
would
transfer
all
immigration
appeals
from
federal
courts
around
the
nation
to
a
federal
appeals
court
in
washington
dc
that
currently
specializes
in
patent
and
bankruptcy
cases
the
transfer
alarms
judges
and
lawyers
who
argue
that
federal
appeals
courts
have
become
critically
important
in
protecting
the
rights
of
immigrants
since
the
bush
administration
four
years
ago
dramatically
downsized
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
the
top
branch
in
the
immigration
courts
in
a
series
last
year
the
knight
ridder
found
that
the
san
franciscobased
9th
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
handles
by
far
the
most
immigration
appeals
in
the
nation
overturns
the
bia
in
twothirds
of
the
most
important
immigration
cases
in
the
west
citing
flawed
decisions
by
immigration
judges
the
rate
is
continuing
to
climb
this
year
since
jan
1
the
9th
circuit
has
overturned
the
bia
in
10
of
14
of
its
published
immigration
rulings
knight
ridder
found
courts
publish
cases
they
deem
to
have
the
most
legal
and
public
policy
importance
critics
of
the
legislation
crafted
by
republican
sen
arlen
specter
the
judiciary
committee
chairman
say
that
removing
those
cases
from
courts
like
the
9th
circuit
will
erode
the
ability
of
people
fighting
deportation
to
be
heard
in
the
legal
system
among
other
things
the
bill
includes
a
provision
that
would
allow
a
single
judge
of
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
washington
known
more
for
deciding
highstakes
patent
feuds
to
reject
immigration
appeals
with
a
brief
order
the
us
judicial
conference
the
policymaking
arm
of
the
federal
courts
sent
a
letter
to
specter
on
friday
opposing
the
proposed
reforms
its
really
disconcerting
to
see
something
this
radical
said
karen
musalo
an
immigration
rights
professor
at
hastings
college
of
the
law
who
joined
dozens
of
law
professors
in
a
letter
opposing
the
senate
legislation
how
is
this
a
sensible
policy
response
to
the
raft
of
problems
the
proposed
reforms
come
at
a
precarious
time
for
the
immigration
system
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
earlier
this
year
ordered
a
broad
probe
into
the
immigration
courts
because
of
concerns
about
how
the
legal
claims
of
immigrants
are
being
handled
the
bia
also
has
been
under
fire
from
federal
appeals
courts
across
the
country
for
shoddy
decisionmaking
prompting
a
number
of
federal
judges
to
call
for
changes
advocates
of
the
legislation
say
shifting
all
cases
to
one
appeals
court
would
provide
more
consistent
rulings
on
immigration
issues
they
also
say
it
would
prevent
immigration
lawyers
from
forum
shopping
to
get
more
favorable
decisions
from
courts
such
as
the
9th
circuit
viewed
as
more
liberal
on
immigration
rights
but
the
legislation
also
includes
provisions
that
even
critics
say
would
improve
immigration
justice
for
instance
it
beefs
up
review
in
specialized
immigration
courts
by
expanding
the
bia
from
its
current
11
members
to
at
least
15
and
possibly
23
members
that
was
the
size
of
the
board
before
it
was
slashed
by
former
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
in
2002
and
the
legislation
would
make
it
tougher
for
the
board
to
decide
cases
without
issuing
an
explanation
a
custom
that
has
prompted
critics
to
say
board
members
are
rubberstamping
deportation
orders
an
aide
to
specter
said
friday
that
the
combination
of
improving
the
bia
and
centralizing
immigration
rulings
in
one
appeals
court
would
relieve
the
crushing
immigration
caseload
for
courts
such
as
the
9th
circuit
the
aide
who
asked
not
be
identified
downplayed
concerns
about
the
federal
circuit
adding
immigration
appeals
to
its
docket
he
said
the
bill
calls
for
the
court
to
add
three
judges
and
a
team
of
immigration
lawyers
the
federal
appeals
courts
handled
about
10000
immigration
appeals
last
year
more
than
half
of
those
in
the
9th
circuit
which
covers
california
and
eight
other
states
chief
judge
of
the
9th
circuit
mary
schroeder
opposes
the
shift
other
federal
appeals
courts
have
weighed
in
against
the
legislation
including
chicagobased
judge
richard
posner
he
urged
the
senate
to
reject
the
reforms
because
they
dont
address
the
underlying
problems
in
the
bia
posner
noted
that
his
court
the
7th
circuit
is
rejecting
bia
decisions
in
nearly
half
its
immigration
rulings
patent
lawyers
many
of
whom
represent
silicon
valley
companies
in
the
federal
circuit
also
worry
that
the
court
will
be
distracted
by
a
rush
of
immigration
matters
as
a
result
judges
and
immigration
lawyers
say
congress
should
focus
on
fixing
the
bia
instead
of
making
changes
to
the
federal
court
system
without
any
study
congress
needs
to
slow
down
hold
a
hearing
and
make
sure
this
isnt
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem
