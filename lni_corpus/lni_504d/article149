a
pair
of
glendora
city
councilmen
this
week
made
an
abortive
attempt
to
get
the
city
to
weigh
in
on
the
national
immigration
debate
at
the
request
of
councilman
doug
tessitor
and
mayor
ken
herman
the
citys
staff
on
tuesday
presented
a
resolution
intended
to
show
that
the
city
supported
a
tough
policy
against
illegal
immigration
but
the
resolution
failed
32
with
herman
and
tessitor
voting
in
its
favor
councilman
gene
murabito
said
the
resolution
did
not
take
a
clearenough
stand
against
illegal
immigration
council
members
terry
kent
and
karen
davis
said
glendora
already
supported
any
state
and
federal
immigration
laws
they
did
not
see
need
to
express
any
further
opinion
on
the
matter
they
said
we
are
already
doing
it
councilman
terry
kent
said
during
the
meeting
i
dont
know
why
we
are
here
to
be
honest
with
you
davis
agreed
it
is
my
feeling
that
we
already
uphold
federal
law
councilwoman
karen
davis
said
and
in
terms
of
trying
to
be
more
specific
on
the
immigration
issue
it
is
beyond
our
jurisdiction
tessitor
said
the
resolution
would
have
passed
if
it
had
stronger
language
against
illegalimmigration
tessitor
who
supports
arizonas
sb
1070
immigration
bill
said
the
resolutions
intent
was
to
take
a
stand
against
sanctuary
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
which
he
said
openly
refuse
to
enforce
immigration
laws
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
buycott
arizona
tessitor
said
i
would
like
to
arrange
a
tour
from
southern
california
to
arizona
to
show
what
they
are
doing
although
he
voted
in
favor
of
the
resolution
he
also
thought
it
wasnt
clear
enough
one
section
read
the
city
of
glendora
supports
the
rule
of
law
and
that
enforcement
of
all
government
laws
rules
and
regulations
must
be
done
in
a
fair
and
equitable
manner
so
that
its
citizens
believe
that
regardless
of
their
race
family
status
religion
creed
or
financial
ability
they
will
be
treated
in
the
true
spirit
of
justice
being
blind
to
those
elements
murabito
said
he
would
have
voted
for
one
terse
statement
regarding
illegal
immigration
the
proposed
resolution
was
mostly
about
supporting
current
immigration
policy
and
had
little
about
supporting
tough
enforcement
he
said
if
we
want
to
make
a
statement
that
we
support
the
laws
why
do
we
then
in
one
paragraph
here
get
very
specific
to
immigration
law
murabito
said
at
the
meeting
to
me
this
whole
resolution
is
saying
in
essence
we
support
the
laws
and
then
oh
by
the
way
we
are
going
to
draft
this
to
address
immigration
tessitor
called
the
resolution
vanilla
other
cities
such
as
costa
mesa
have
passed
resolutions
declaring
themselves
rule
of
law
cities
in
a
stance
against
illegal
immigration
tessitor
said
he
would
consider
bringing
the
resolution
back
this
time
with
different
language
i
have
to
think
about
whether
or
not
it
is
something
i
want
to
push
or
not
he
said
tessitor
said
the
issue
had
nothing
to
do
with
implications
of
racism
in
arizonas
law
or
immigration
enforcement
but
was
merely
a
legal
matter
it
is
not
a
matter
of
race
he
said
the
key
word
in
this
whole
discussion
is
illegal
that
is
the
operative
word
what
i
dont
get
is
what
people
dont
understand
about
the
meaning
of
that
word
illegal
