a

is
launching
a
campaign
calling
on
federal
lawmakers
to
reform
immigration
laws
and
also
urging
state
officials
to
draft
policies
addressing
aspects
of
illegal
immigration
the
new
jersey
immigration
policy
network
said
monday
it
will
place
internet
and
print
ads
that
cast
immigrants
as
a
foundation
of
the
united
states
and
urge
residents
to
pressure
members
of
the
us
senate
who
njipn
says
are
obstructing
efforts
to
revamp
immigration
laws
njipn
made
its
announcement
as
the
senate
prepares
to
renew
debate
on
an
immigration
reform
measure
that
would
strengthen
enforcement
along
the
usmexican
border
while
giving
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
a
way
to
legalize
their
status
debate
over
the
measure
collapsed
earlier
this
month
after
democrats
and
republicans
bickered
over
components
of
the
reform
proposal
but
they
pledged
to
return
to
talks
after
an
appeal
by
president
bush
last
week
doing
nothing
about
immigration
is
not
an
option
said
charles
shai
goldstein
executive
director
of
njipn
a
coalition
of
more
than
40
organizations
that
focus
on
such
issues
as
civil
rights
labor
and
immigrants
rights
its
impossible
to
deport
12
million
undocumented
people
everybody
knows
that
contact
senators
njipn
is
urging
new
jersey
residents
to
ask
friends
and
relatives
who
live
in
other
states
to
press
their
us
senators
to
support
a
path
to
legal
us
residency
for
illegal
immigrants
who
meet
a
specific
set
of
criteria
among
those
criteria
are
acquiring
some
proficiency
in
english
no
criminal
record
and
payment
of
a
fine
some
republicans
in
the
senate
have
expressed
objections
to
offering
the
path
to
legalization
saying
it
amounts
to
an
amnesty
for
lawbreakers
the
immigrants
who
are
here
are
potential
new
americans
said
goldstein
if
the
work
werent
there
for
them
the
immigrants
wouldnt
be
here
we
need
a
rational
humane
system
of
immigration
beyond
the
grassroots
outreach
targeting
the
us
senate
the
njipn
campaign
will
press
state
officials
to
support
instate
college
tuition
fees
for
undocumented
students
and
to
take
a
stand
against
police
enforcing
immigration
laws
the
corzine
administration
has
expressed
support
for
instate
tuition
fees
for
illegal
immigrants
and
has
voiced
objection
to
police
acting
as
immigration
agents
the
campaign
also
will
run
internet
and
print
ads
featuring
the
statue
of
liberty
and
messages
that
depict
immigration
as
important
to
the
nation
we
want
to
get
a
paradigm
shift
in
the
debate
over
immigration
to
underscore
that
immigration
is
one
of
the
foundations
of
our
country
goldstein
said
immigration
is
what
made
our
country
strong
it
made
it
what
it
was
and
what
it
is
employers
blamed
those
who
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
criticized
the
njipn
campaign
its
debatable
whether
illegal
immigrants
will
go
away
said
gayle
kesselman
a
carlstadt
resident
and
cochairwoman
of
new
jersey
citizens
for
immigration
control
if
employers
offer
decent
wages
to
american
workers
and
do
not
continue
to
break
the
law
in
their
pursuit
of
the
almighty
dollar
then
illegal
immigrants
would
go
away
i
do
not
blame
people
who
come
over
the
border
in
search
of
a
better
life
kesselman
said
the
villains
that
have
caused
the
tragedy
of
illegal
immigration
are
the
greedy
employers
and
politicians
who
have
colluded
together
to
create
this
untenable
situation
