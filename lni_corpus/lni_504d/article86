july

us
supreme
court
ruling
last
week
on
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
may
have
clarified
the
legality
of
certain
provisions
in
the
law
but
did
little
to
address
the
overall
issue
of
illegal
immigration
the
court
decided
53
to
strike
down
three
key
provisions
in
arizonas
law
but
upheld
probably
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
law
which
requires
police
officers
to
verify
immigration
status
for
anyone
they
stop
and
suspect
of
not
being
in
the
united
states
legally
fears
of
racial
profiling
have
been
voiced
loudly
especially
by
the
latino
population
while
we
dont
support
most
of
what
arizona
tried
to
accomplish
with
its
immigration
law
we
understand
the
states
dilemma
greatly
affected
by
the
flow
of
illegal
immigrants
into
its
state
and
lacking
any
sound
federal
immigration
law
to
turn
to
the
state
like
others
took
the
matter
into
its
own
hands
its
incredible
how
little
has
been
done
at
the
national
level
to
develop
a
comprehensive
immigration
policy
even
though
there
is
bipartisan
support
for
the
most
sensible
propositions
regarding
immigration
that
a
guest
worker
program
be
created
that
borders
be
secured
and
that
there
be
a
path
to
citizenship
for
those
who
migrate
to
this
country
we
dont
know
why
this
issue
has
constantly
been
shoved
to
the
back
burner
many
blame
the
fact
that
its
almost
constantly
an
election
year
and
those
running
for
office
see
immigration
as
a
hot
button
topic
they
dont
want
to
touch
more
likely
it
is
that
immigration
has
slid
down
the
priority
list
for
most
politicians
what
the
fence
along
our
southern
border
couldnt
do
our
longsuffering
economy
has
accomplished
the
influx
of
immigrants
from
south
of
the
border
has
dramatically
fallen
off
as
industries
such
as
construction
have
simply
stopped
hiring
take
away
the
jobs
and
they
wont
come
the
lack
of
immigrants
has
hurt
our
agricultural
producers
many
of
whom
have
experienced
worker
shortages
some
to
the
point
of
being
unable
to
bring
in
crops
or
get
their
cows
milked
of
course
if
the
economy
improves
dramatically
then
immigration
will
once
again
become
a
hot
political
issue
maybe
now
is
the
time
when
immigration
is
not
such
a
prominent
issue
that
a
reasonable
national
policy
could
be
drafted
debated
and
ultimately
approved
then
states
like
arizona
wouldnt
feel
like
their
hands
are
being
forced
to
solve
a
problem
that
really
should
be
addressed
