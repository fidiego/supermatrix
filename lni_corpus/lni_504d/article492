lucia
artal
ramos
is
a
trophy
of
the
los
angeles
riots
one
of
hundreds
of
illegal
immigrants
who
were
swept
off
the
streets
as
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
took
advantage
of
the
citys
recent
chaos
by
her
own
account
police
officers
stopped
her
on
the
evening
of
may
4
told
her
she
was
going
to
get
a
free
ride
back
to
your
country
and
handed
her
over
to
immigration
agents
who
held
her
without
charges
for
18
days
before
a
lawyer
obtained
her
release
mrs
ramos
who
is
from
guatemala
is
part
of
one
of
the
biggest
hauls
of
illegal
immigrants
in
the
history
of
the
city
where
thousands
of
newcomers
live
and
work
without
documents
among
the
legal
hispanic
residents
in
the
weeks
since
the
riots
criticism
has
grown
that
the
police
and
immigration
agents
improperly
detained
people
although
the
officials
deny
it
the
critics
say
that
hundreds
of
hispanic
residents
were
interrogated
about
their
immigration
status
on
the
basis
of
their
race
alone
we
were
out
there
doing
our
job
robert
m
moschorak
the
los
angeles
regional
director
of
the
immigration
service
said
in
a
recent
interview
im
very
proud
of
the
job
we
did
781
illegal
aliens
deported
he
denied
that
his
agents
had
overstepped
the
law
and
he
said
many
of
the
looters
and
lawbreakers
had
been
illegal
aliens
as
of
last
weekend
his
office
said
944
people
most
of
them
from
mexico
had
been
taken
into
custody
by
the
immigration
service
of
these
781
waived
their
right
to
a
deportation
hearing
and
were
immediately
sent
back
across
the
mexican
border
critics
of
the
roundup
including
immigrantrights
group
and
civil
liberties
organizations
as
well
as
local
hispanic
officials
say
that
rather
than
helping
to
restore
order
as
it
had
been
asked
to
do
the
immigration
service
saw
a
chance
to
pursue
its
own
agenda
we
were
a
city
in
crisis
and
our
politicians
and
police
commission
should
not
have
allowed
the
enforcement
of
civil
immigration
violations
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
attempts
to
calm
down
and
defuse
the
situation
said
nils
w
frenzen
directing
attorney
of
public
council
a
legal
aid
group
these
complaints
were
aired
at
a
hearing
last
week
of
the
police
commission
a
civilian
body
that
oversees
the
police
force
the
commission
president
stanley
k
sheinbaum
said
the
complaints
would
be
investigated
by
a
special
commission
studying
police
conduct
during
the
rioting
that
began
april
29
the
day
that
four
los
angeles
police
officers
were
acquitted
of
severely
beating
a
black
motorist
rodney
g
king
as
looters
rampaged
through
stores
the
critics
say
the
police
and
immigration
officials
were
loading
their
vehicles
with
illegal
aliens
they
had
detained
in
a
variety
of
improper
ways
in
some
cases
like
that
of
mrs
ramos
the
critics
say
the
police
violated
longstanding
procedures
by
detaining
people
solely
because
they
did
not
have
documents
to
prove
they
were
in
the
country
legally
the
police
denied
this
accusation
immigrant
rights
groups
have
gathered
numerous
examples
of
men
and
women
who
say
they
were
arrested
without
criminal
charges
for
failing
to
produce
immigration
documents
while
shopping
or
waiting
at
bus
stops
or
during
searches
for
looted
goods
in
their
homes
such
police
detentions
on
federal
statutes
would
only
be
legal
in
rare
circumstances
in
other
cases
as
the
police
themselves
confirm
they
handed
over
to
the
immigration
service
people
who
had
been
detained
for
looting
or
curfew
violations
but
who
normally
would
have
been
released
for
lack
of
strong
evidence
we
had
a
large
number
about
100
out
of
363
arrested
for
curfew
violations
and
looted
goods
with
status
determined
to
be
undocumented
said
capt
dennis
conti
the
commander
of
newton
police
station
in
a
heavily
hispanic
area
those
were
turned
over
directly
to
ins
it
speeds
up
the
system
agents
accompanied
officers
such
action
violates
a
longstanding
department
policy
of
working
hand
in
hand
with
immigration
agents
in
still
other
cases
the
police
said
that
immigration
agents
accompanied
them
in
hispanic
neighborhoods
as
interpreters
critics
say
the
agents
took
advantage
of
the
situation
to
interrogate
and
detain
people
on
the
basis
of
their
immigration
status
in
one
case
e
j
flynn
the
legal
director
of
the
central
american
refugee
center
said
a
guatemalan
he
would
identify
only
as
miguel
r
was
visiting
his
girlfriend
when
the
police
and
immigration
agents
knocked
on
the
door
to
search
her
apartment
for
looted
goods
he
was
detained
when
he
was
unable
to
prove
that
he
was
in
the
country
legally
using
the
required
technical
legal
terms
mr
moschorak
said
people
were
asked
to
prove
their
immigration
status
only
when
specific
articulable
facts
would
lead
an
agent
to
believe
that
they
were
undocumented
he
said
such
facts
could
include
things
like
speaking
a
foreign
language
wearing
clothing
that
would
basically
be
of
foreign
origin
or
foreign
appearance
if
coupled
with
some
of
these
other
things
he
agreed
that
such
a
description
could
apply
to
vast
portions
of
the
citys
population
in
which
40
percent
of
residents
are
of
hispanic
origin
and
hold
a
variety
of
immigration
statuses
in
addition
the
critics
say
united
states
border
patrol
agents
who
joined
the
peacekeeping
efforts
in
the
city
along
with
a
number
of
other
federal
agencies
were
assigned
to
patrol
hispanic
neighborhoods
where
the
effect
of
their
presence
was
less
to
restore
order
than
to
sow
fear
federal
lawenforcement
forces
have
been
deployed
in
our
city
to
apprehend
looters
arsonists
and
murderers
who
have
terrorized
our
community
said
city
councilman
mike
hernandez
one
of
several
political
leaders
who
spoke
out
against
the
activities
of
the
immigration
service
they
should
not
be
here
to
arrest
and
detain
lawabiding
bystanders
who
may
happen
to
be
undocumented
mr
moschorak
said
about
400
agents
of
the
border
patrol
were
deployed
in
the
city
to
assist
in
keeping
order
but
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
arrested
aliens
who
were
illegally
in
the
country
only
because
they
were
illegally
in
the
country
stopped
in
the
street
when
police
officers
turned
their
searchlight
on
mrs
ramos
and
her
husband
as
they
were
walking
to
a
restaurant
late
at
night
in
the
aftermath
of
the
rioting
she
said
she
did
not
know
why
they
were
stopping
her
the
policewoman
said
what
are
you
a
prostitute
how
would
you
like
a
free
ride
back
to
your
country
mrs
ramos
said
when
she
and
her
husband
who
worked
as
a
security
guard
told
the
officers
that
they
did
not
have
immigration
papers
they
were
taken
to
a
police
station
and
turned
over
to
the
immigration
service
without
being
charged
with
any
crime
she
said
last
weekend
she
was
released
pending
a
hearing
because
she
is
four
months
pregnant
and
was
becoming
ill
said
mr
flynn
who
is
representing
her
as
for
her
husband
mrs
ramos
said
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
night
of
their
arrest
and
had
been
told
by
immigration
officials
that
they
had
no
record
of
him
i
assume
he
is
still
in
prison
here
somewhere
