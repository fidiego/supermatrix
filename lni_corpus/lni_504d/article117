had

during

for

the
heart
of
the
arizona

requires
local

officials
once
they
stop
a

immigration

what
can

done
now
to
save
florida
from
being
the
sanctuary
state
from
a

now
that
georgia

weve

for
the

and
let
everybody
we
elect
know
that
its
important
to
us
yet
scott
did
little
to
push
an

through

legislature
and
all
but
abandoned
calls
for
the
law
after

he

immigration
hearings
heat
up
in
advance
of
legislative
session
updated
tuesday
january
11th
2011
by
aaron
sharockman
in
his
bruising
primary
with
republican
attorney
general
bill
mccollum
rick
scott
often
tried
to
outflank
mccollum
by
claiming
to
be
a
more
pure
conservative
no
issue
better
illustrates
this
than
immigration
where
scott
repeatedly
whacked
mccollum
for
moderate
or
changing
positions
in
may
scott
began
airing
an
ad
that
said
mccollum
opposed
bringing
a
controversial
arizona
immigration
law
to
florida
that
would
allow
police
officers
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
stopped
to
question
the
ad
used
mccollums
own
words
we
dont
need
that
law
in
florida
thats
not
whats
gonna
happen
here
while
saying
scott
would
get
tough
on
illegal
immigration
rick
scott
backs
arizonas
law
hell
bring
it
to
florida
and
let
our
police
check
if
the
people
they
arrest
are
here
legally
thats
common
sense
scott
repeatedly
promised
during
the
primary
to
bring
an
arizonastyle
law
to
florida
if
elected
this
scottometer
update
will
measure
scotts
progress
first
some
background
the
arizona
law
requires
local
law
enforcement
officials
once
they
stop
a
person
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
reasonably
suspect
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
the
bill
originally
was
signed
into
law
on
april
23
2010
by
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
an
amended
version
of
the
law
one
to
lessen
the
prospects
that
racial
profiling
could
occur
passed
and
was
signed
into
law
on
april
30
the
new
version
of
the
law
says
a
law
enforcement
official
or
agency
of
this
state
or
a
county
city
town
or
other
political
subdivision
of
this
state
may
not
consider
race
color
or
national
origin
in
implementing
the
requirements
of
this
subsection
except
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
united
states
or
arizona
constitution
politifact
florida
has
written
extensively
about
the
immigration
bill
for
instance
we
ruled
that
mccollum
committed
a
full
flop
for
waffling
positions
on
bringing
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
to
florida
in
the
end
he
ultimately
worked
with
a
state
legislator
to
draft
a
proposed
law
for
florida
interestingly
we
also
ruled
true
a
claim
by
mccollum
that
florida
officers
already
have
the
ability
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
those
who
are
arrested
scotts
talk
about
the
immigration
law
died
down
during
his
general
election
campaign
against
democrat
chief
financial
officer
alex
sink
but
a
bill
meant
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
has
been
filed
in
the
senate
and
one
will
be
filed
in
the
house
on
jan
10
2011
the
senate
held
the
first
of
three
factfinding
public
hearings
to
help
craft
a
final
bill
the
bills
sponsor
mike
bennett
rbradenton
said
he
expected
a
difficult
road
bennett
said
he
copied
much
of
his
bill
from
the
arizona
version
though
its
unclear
what
a
final
immigration
bill
might
look
like
there
probably
will
not
be
an
arizona
immigrationstyle
bill
that
passes
the
florida
senate
bennett
told
marc
caputo
of
the
st
petersburg
timesmiami
herald
tallahassee
bureau
bennett
said
he
is
concerned
with
the
part
of
the
bill
thats
most
identified
with
arizonas
law
the
requirement
that
local
police
with
reasonable
suspicion
attempt
to
determine
a
persons
immigration
status
during
a
routine
traffic
stop
or
arrest
bennett
said
the
measure
could
lead
to
racial
or
ethnic
profiling
i
might
not
even
vote
for
it
myself
bennett
said
in
the
house
rep
william
snyder
rstuart
said
hes
pushing
ahead
and
expects
a
bill
to
pass
there
but
unless
it
passes
in
the
senate
it
wont
become
law
whether
scott
wants
it
to
or
not
for
his
part
scott
hasnt
yet
entered
the
discussions
when
asked
about
bennetts
bill
last
week
he
said
were
looking
at
that
but
i
havent
made
a
decision
all
of
this
could
spell
trouble
for
the
proposed
law
as
the
legislative
session
begins
in
march
but
its
too
early
to
draw
conclusions
now
that
the
legislature
has
started
formal
discussions
of
bringing
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
to
florida
were
able
to
move
this
promise
to
in

works
