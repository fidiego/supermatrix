highlightÂ a
hot
topic
this
summer
its
share
of
the
spotlight
is
uncertain
as
capitol
hills
recess
ends
like
a
big
project
that
doesnt
just
go
away
during
vacation
the
issue
of
immigration
awaits
congress
when
it
returns
from
its
summer
recess
its
future
is
unclear
this
summer
immigration
reform
appears
to
have
garnered
additional
support
from
the
republican
side
of
the
us
house
perhaps
enough
to
pass
legislation
if
immigration
measures
ever
get
to
a
full
vote
activists
calling
for
reform
spent
august
pushing
for
that
move
more
phone
calls
more
rallies
more
prayer
events
and
they
mostly
came
from
one
side
as
little
was
heard
from
opponents
some
proreform
activists
hailed
it
as
a
success
we
have
seen
a
lot
of
momentum
throughout
the
august
recess
in
orange
county
and
across
the
country
said
wendy
tarr
director
of
the
orange
county
chapter
of
clergy
and
laity
united
for
economic
justice
a
faithbased
organization
part
of
me
is
encouraged
that
when
they
go
back
to
work
legislators
will
caucus
and
will
have
very
positive
stories
about
business
leaders
speaking
to
them
agricultural
leaders
faith
leaders
and
other
people
who
have
worked
to
communicate
with
them
tarr
said
rep
john
campbell
rirvine
said
its
been
a
hot
topic
this
summer
in
orange
county
we
got
more
calls
on
immigration
than
any
other
issue
he
said
the
congressman
received
approximately
350
calls
and
17
letters
in
support
of
immigration
reform
and
about
80
calls
and
23
letters
expressing
concerns
about
the
senatepassed
bill
andor
blanket
amnesty
said
christopher
bognanno
campbells
spokesman
in
orange
county
campbell
was
one
of
two
congressmen
targeted
by
pro
immigration
reform
forces
rep
ed
royce
rfullerton
was
the
second
royces
spokeswoman
did
not
provide
any
numbers
saying
their
office
does
not
keep
such
statistics
one
of
the
groups
coordinating
volunteers
on
calls
to
campbell
and
royce
was
the
orange
county
labor
federation
volunteers
made
close
to
60000
calls
and
patched
through
more
than
500
callers
to
each
congressman
said
julio
perez
director
of
the
local
aflcio
organization
has
this
been
enough
to
sway
ed
royce
and
john
campbell
to
come
out
in
public
support
of
immigration
reform
no
it
hasnt
perez
said
but
whats
different
is
that
were
having
longer
conversations
with
people
in
the
past
they
would
last
30
seconds
to
a
minute
these
conversations
last
longer
they
are
real
conversations
not
just
yes
and
no
answers
in
an
interview
friday
campbell
said
he
is
sympathetic
and
interested
in
a
pathway
to
residency
but
he
does
not
support
the
senatepassed
bill
that
would
allow
some
11
million
people
here
illegally
the
right
to
become
citizens
royce
said
in
an
email
that
he
wants
to
work
on
securing
the
border
first
faster
documentation
for
immigrants
and
a
workable
employer
verification
system
five
immigrationrelated
bills
have
cleared
house
committees
and
await
consideration
by
the
full
chamber
none
address
the
controversial
proposal
adopted
by
the
senate
that
would
create
a
13year
path
to
citizenship
for
people
who
either
came
here
illegally
or
arrived
with
temporary
visas
and
overstayed
them
according
to
americas
voice
a
washington
dcbased
proimmigrant
organization
24
house
republicans
have
publicly
endorsed
citizenship
as
part
of
an
immigration
overhaul
when
and
how
the
issue
will
surface
for
a
vote
is
up
to
house
speaker
john
boehner
rohio
who
has
pledged
that
he
will
not
break
the
hastert
rule
a
practice
that
calls
for
a
bill
to
be
brought
to
the
house
floor
for
a
vote
only
when
a
majority
of
the
majority
supports
a
measure
there
is
precedent
for
breaking
the
rule
and
house
conservatives
have
warned
boehner
not
to
do
it
with
immigration
his
membership
is
so
angry
that
he
has
broken
it
in
the
past
that
they
have
increased
the
pressure
to
not
break
it
again
over
immigration
said
doris
meissner
a
senior
fellow
and
director
for
the
us
immigration
policy
program
at
the
migration
policy
institute
a
nonpartisan
think
tank
there
are
other
challenges
congress
has
fewer
than
50
legislative
days
before
the
end
of
the
year
and
legislators
must
tackle
other
serious
subjects
i
do
expect
syria
to
be
the
first
priority
because
its
the
most
urgent
campbell
said
other
imminent
subjects
include
government
funding
and
whether
to
raise
the
debt
limit
i
would
be
surprised
if
we
get
to
immigration
before
november
or
december
and
while
immigration
is
a
hotbutton
issue
in
california
in
other
parts
of
the
country
health
care
jobs
and
the
economy
are
taking
prominence
before
immigration
campbell
said
at
town
hall
meetings
across
the
us
last
month
there
was
little
of
the
anger
voiced
over
other
immigration
reform
campaigns
in
previous
years
on
friday
sen
marco
rubio
rfla
was
heckled
while
giving
a
speech
at
a
conservative
conference
but
that
has
been
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
a
wholesale
antiimmigrant
outpouring
around
the
country
in
the
way
we
experienced
in
2006
and
2007
did
not
happen
said
meissner
former
commissioner
of
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
or
ins
an
agency
that
was
broken
up
in
2003
into
different
organizations
including
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
and
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
or
ice
some
local
leaders
against
changing
immigration
laws
disagree
there
has
been
a
lot
of
activity
by
us
we
have
demonstrated
and
gone
to
town
halls
all
over
the
country
and
met
with
legislators
or
their
staffs
said
evelyn
miller
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
california
coalition
for
immigration
reform
an
ocbased
group
that
is
fighting
the
illegal
alien
invasion
for
the
preservation
of
our
nation
robin
hvidston
executive
director
of
the
claremontbased
we
the
people
californias
crusaders
said
her
organization
also
has
been
active
attending
meetings
and
making
calls
but
her
group
does
not
have
the
money
to
bus
in
activists
from
other
areas
thats
what
proamnesty
people
are
doing
she
said
said
meissner
the
leadership
in
the
republican
house
and
in
general
knows
they
have
to
deal
with
this
issue
its
a
question
of
whether
they
will
sooner
or
later
