immigration
law
a
federal
crackdown
on
individuals
and
groups
practicing
immigration
law
without
authorization
is
welcomed
by
local
immigration
advocates
on
thursday
three
us
agencies
department
of
homeland
security
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
trade
commission
launched
an
initiative
targeting
immigration
scams
usually
involving
notarios
its
immeasurable
in
oklahoma
it
is
a
vast
problem
that
cuts
across
all
sectors
of
immigration
law
said
douglas
stump
oklahoma
city
immigration
attorney
and
current
vice
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
existing
immigration
law
provides
no
relief
for
many
foreign
nationals
who
visit
multiple
attorneys
and
notforprofits
telling
them
they
are
not
eligible
for
relief
but
they
keep
looking
for
hope
and
corrupt
notarios
give
them
false
hope
the
federal
effort
will
focus
on
enforcement
education
and
continued
collaboration
the
goal
is
to
step
up
prosecutions
of
unauthorized
people
giving
immigration
advice
and
services
and
to
educate
immigrants
on
finding
legitimate
representation
attorney
chris
gentges
of
the
ywca
multicultural
center
said
unauthorized
services
typically
pop
up
as
storefronts
with
a
generic
spanish
name
offering
cheap
services
officials
may
call
themselves
immigration
consultants
and
some
offer
tax
services
people
think
they
are
dealing
with
attorneys
gentges
said
in
mexico
someone
called
a
notario
is
a
lawyer
here
it
means
notary
and
those
people
call
themselves
notario
knowing
how
that
is
being
perceived
they
are
cheaper
but
they
are
not
authorized
to
practice
immigration
law
but
continue
to
do
so
oklahoma
has
always
had
a
certain
number
of
unauthorized
immigration
practitioners
she
said
we
have
problems
even
in
our
own
industry
with
attorneys
who
have
been
disbarred
and
still
trying
to
practice
immigration
law
gentges
said
they
have
always
been
there
but
there
may
be
a
few
more
now
the
fallout
from
submitting
inaccurate
immigration
paperwork
is
expensive
and
can
affect
a
persons
residency
or
work
status
its
devastating
stump
said
many
foreign
nationals
scammed
are
not
fluent
in
english
and
the
notarios
will
have
them
attest
an
oath
that
everything
submitted
is
true
they
dont
know
what
they
are
pledging
the
notarios
will
provide
false
information
to
authorities
which
will
then
cause
a
lifetime
ban
the
foreign
national
gets
deported
and
the
notario
has
pocketed
the
money
in
the
unveiling
of
the
effort
top
federal
officials
called
it
a
historic
effort
to
combat
immigration
scams
last
year
the
federal
government
worked
with
local
and
state
officials
to
secure
convictions
with
sentences
of
up
to
eight
years
and
restitution
of
more
than
18
million
the
federal
trade
commission
is
creating
an
immigration
code
in
its
consumer
sentinel
network
the
network
is
a
secure
online
database
that
holds
more
than
6
million
fraud
complaints
and
shared
with
more
than
2000
law
enforcement
entities
it
will
be
used
as
an
investigative
tool
for
the
federal
immigration
service
fraud
division
and
for
national
security
officers
and
bolster
communication
between
agencies
about
scamrelated
cases
also
the
agencies
will
work
to
increase
the
number
of
authorized
immigration
specialists
and
organizations
fraud
committed
by
the
notarios
can
be
prosecuted
by
local
district
attorneys
and
can
be
investigated
by
the
state
attorney
general
the
oklahoma
attorney
generals
office
received
11
complaints
against
immigration
service
providers
in
fiscal
year
2009
and
one
for
fiscal
year
2011
said
spokeswoman
diane
clay
as
states
implement
enforcementheavy
immigration
laws
to
detain
and
deport
illegal
immigrants
the
notarios
use
that
to
their
advantage
stump
said
as
it
stands
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
the
club
for
the
notarios
stump
said
the
notarios
will
turn
them
in
to
law
enforcement
if
the
foreign
national
attempts
to
get
their
money
back
they
are
told
go
ahead
and
turn
me
in
you
are
the
one
to
be
deported
not
me
they
threaten
the
families
if
we
can
get
state
law
enforcement
agencies
to
fill
the
void
then
we
may
see
some
progress
under
the
obama
administration
deportation
and
detentions
are
at
an
alltime
high
going
from
369221
in
september
2008
to
392862
in
september
2010
with
the
trend
continuing
the
current
administration
is
trying
to
fashion
an
avenue
for
people
to
step
forward
but
it
will
take
time
to
see
if
its
effective
stump
said
but
the
problem
is
egregious
and
has
not
been
addressed
to
date
but
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction

more
