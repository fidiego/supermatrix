civil
and
human
rights
for
all
people
regardless

status
the
failures

have
had
profound
impacts
within
the
boulder
community
according
to
the
statement
these
include
very
young
students
losing
motivation
to
excel
in

learning
because

that

and
the
existence
of
an
underclass
climate
of
fear
informal
economy
and
work
force
inequities
boulder

continues
welcomes
and
encourages
cooperation

to
work
together
to
support
swift
and
responsible
legislative
action
to
produce
equitable
humane
effective
and
comprehensive
federal
immigration
reform
among
the
goals
of
that
reform
are
creating

laws
a
rational
and
humane
approach
to
the
undocumented
population
simplified
visa
systems
that
include
family
unification
controlled
immigration
rates
and
improved
border
control
by
approving
the
statement
which
the
city
council
will
consider
at
an
upcoming
meeting
boulder
would
also
be
supporting
federal
legislation
that
would
qualify
students
for
immigration
relief
if
they
have
been
in
the
country
for
several
years
graduated
from
high
school
or
obtained
a
ged
and
completed
at
least
two
years
of
college
or
military
service
the
citys
lobbying
efforts
would
oppose

mandate
local
governments
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
city
is
committed
to
fully
adhering
to
the
requirements
of
colorado
law
which
require
local
governments
to
communicate
and
cooperate
with
federal
officials
with
regard
to
the
immigration
status
of
any
person
within
the
state
the
city
is
also
supportive
of
preserving
the
option
for
its
police
to
enforce
federal
laws
including
federal
immigration
laws
however
it
will
vigorously
oppose
any
state
or
federal
legislation
that
mandates
that
its
police
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
especially
if
they
are
unfunded
mandates
or
are
likely
to
result
in
enforcement
officers
engaging
in
racial
profiling

a
stop
to

travel
to
arizona
saying
it
could
put

employees
at

after
a
federal
judge
put
on

the
most
controversial
parts
of
the

council
also
considered
