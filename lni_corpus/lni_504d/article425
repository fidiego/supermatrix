dan
stein
is
executive
director
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
congress
is
poised
to
increase
immigration
to
alltime
highs
adding
at
least
a
quartermillion
new
immigrants
a
year
and
probably
more
the
house
bill
would
probably
raise
levels
to
well
over
1
million
a
year
by
1994
and
increase
the
us
population
by
over
100
million
by
2080
cost
estimates
range
up
to
3
billion
a
year
most
to
be
borne
by
state
and
local
governments
and
taxpayers
what
you
say
increase
immigration
with
economic
storm
clouds
on
the
horizon
bring
in
more
immigrants
when
medicare
is
about
to
be
cut
by
60
billion
and
deficit
reduction
taxes
are
to
be
levied
on
our
unskilled
and
poorest
when
living
standards
of
those
on
the
bottom
half
of
the
income
ladder
are
headed
straight
down
when
illegal
immigrants
are
still
pouring
in
is
this
the
time
to
raise
immigration
to
alltime
highs
not
according
to
the
polls
a
new
roper
survey
says
that
over
75
of
the
american
people
want
less
not
more
immigration
large
majorities
also
want
illegal
immigration
brought
under
control
before
any
consideration
is
given
to
adding
more
immigrants
why
did
the
house
pass
such
a
bill
the
truth
is
found
in
the
special
interests
that
captured
the
house
immigration
lawyers
ethnic
groups
cheap
labor
advocates
cast
as
a
bill
to
increase
skilled
immigration
its
really
special
interest
legislation
in
disguise
the
bill
contains
two
new
amnesties
for
illegal
aliens
promotes
more
chain
migration
of
extended
families
of
recent
immigrants
brings
in
more
political
asylumseekers
and
their
families
and
reestablishes
the
discredited
idea
of
national
origin
discrimination
rather
than
reverting
to
ethnic
discrimination
in
our
policy
and
sending
immigration
numbers
through
the
roof
congress
should
get
our
borders
under
control
enforce
the
sanctions
against
hiring
illegal
immigrants
then
put
an
overall
ceiling
on
legal
immigration
consistent
with
a
stable
us
population
establish
a
system
of
packet
immigration
which
keeps
nuclear
families
intact
and
ends
chain
migration
of
extended
families
open
immigration
opportunities
for
people
on
the
basis
of
skills
and
economic
contribution
not
nepotistic
family
relations
most
americans
think
250
million
americans
is
enough
congress
should
leave
the
current
immigration
proposals
at
the
border
and
start
over
next
year
