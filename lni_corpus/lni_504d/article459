barletta
plans
to
have
city
police
certified
as
immigration
enforcement
agents
despite
claims
from
opponents
to
his
illegal
immigration
relief
act
that
immigration
enforcement
is
strictly
a
federal
task
barletta
said
he
learned
about
a
1996
amendment
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
an
immigration
enforcement
training
and
certification
program
offered
by
the
bureau
during
a
trip
to
washington
dc
in
december
the
1996
amendment
allows
state
county
and
municipal
law
enforcement
and
corrections
officers
to
enforce
immigration
law
under
certain
circumstances
on
that
trip
barletta
members
of
his
administration
and
city
police
officers
met
with
federal
law
enforcement
and
immigration
officials
to
discuss
strategies
for
handling
hazletons
crime
problems
my
first
and
foremost
wish
was
that
the
immigration
enforcement
bureau
would
locate
an
office
here
in
hazleton
however
this
is
another
option
that
i
believe
would
benefit
hazleton
i
would
like
to
enter
into
a
memorandum
of
understanding
and
well
pursue
the
possibility
barletta
said
giving
city
police
officers
the
ability
to
process
illegal
immigrants
would
be
an
advantage
barletta
said
given
the
unlikelihood
that
the
bureau
will
locate
a
field
office
in
the
city
talking
with
the
police
chief
there
are
some
cities
that
dont
want
to
get
involved
in
taking
the
time
required
in
processing
those
involved
in
illegal
immigration
however
in
hazleton
we
believe
it
would
speed
up
the
process
of
having
our
officers
trained
and
certified
to
handle
the
immigration
violations
under
certain
circumstances
that
are
allowed
barletta
said
in
addition
to
a
memorandum
of
understanding
there
are
some
fairly
rigorous
requirements
for
participation
said
mike
gilhooley
spokesman
for
the
department
of
homeland
securitys
bureau
of
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
he
said
any
police
or
corrections
officers
who
participate
in
the
program
would
have
to
undergo
three
to
five
weeks
of
instruction
on
immigration
law
civil
rights
law
and
antiprofiling
information
basically
the
training
is
designed
to
give
officers
an
outstanding
understanding
of
immigration
law
and
protect
the
civil
rights
of
the
people
in
their
custody
he
said
gilhooley
said
agencies
in
four
counties
and
three
states
have
memorandums
of
understanding
with
his
bureau
and
158
law
enforcement
or
corrections
officers
have
been
certified
as
immigration
enforcement
agents
the
state
entities
include
the
florida
department
of
law
enforcement
the
alabama
department
of
public
safety
and
the
arizona
department
of
corrections
counties
with
entities
include
sheriffs
departments
in
los
angeles
san
bernardino
and
riverside
counties
in
california
and
mecklenburg
county
in
north
carolina
gilhooley
said
the
federal
government
pays
the
instructors
the
state
county
or
municipal
agency
involved
pays
its
employees
and
provides
the
facility
for
the
training
civil
rights
attorneys
have
threatened
to
sue
the
city
if
council
passed
barlettas
relief
act
ordinance
which
fines
landlords
who
rent
to
illegal
immigrants
punishes
businesses
that
employ
them
and
disallows
official
communication
in
languages
other
than
english
city
council
passed
the
illegal
immigration
relief
act
on
july
13
and
is
expected
to
pass
in
august
a
landlordtenant
ordinance
that
would
require
tenants
to
obtain
occupancy
permits
to
get
an
occupancy
permit
they
would
have
to
prove
residency
status
or
citizenship
the
attorneys
said
that
the
ordinances
violate
immigration
and
fair
housing
laws
but
the
times
leader
also
learned
last
week
that
federal
immigration
attorneys
dont
believe
hazleton
code
enforcement
officers
would
be
violating
immigration
law
by
asking
for
documents
that
show
proof
of
legal
residency
or
citizenship
when
issuing
occupancy
permits
our
legal
department
could
find
nothing
in
immigration
law
that
would
preclude
a
government
agency
from
requesting
such
documents
if
doing
so
would
accomplish
something
useful
within
its
lawful
authority
said
chris
bentley
spokesman
for
the
us
department
of
homeland
securitys
bureau
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
bentley
posed
the
question
to
them
after
a
reporter
asked
if
city
officials
were
allowed
to
require
people
to
show
documents
that
would
prove
their
right
to
legally
reside
in
the
united
states
or
if
that
power
was
limited
to
immigration
officials
and
employers
bentley
stressed
that
the
bureaus
attorneys
were
not
offering
a
legal
opinion
and
we
would
never
render
one
in
a
case
like
this
because
its
out
of
their
legal
purview
in
the
daytoday
operations
of
the
bureau
but
bentley
said
council
requiring
code
officers
to
request
documents
to
prove
residency
status
or
citizenship
for
the
dispensation
of
occupancy
permits
would
seem
to
fit
within
their
lawful
authority
based
on
our
understanding
of
immigration
law
