washington
an
obscure
immigration
appeals
board
at
the
us
justice
department
has
drawn
attention
for
allowing
some
aliens
who
committed
crimes
to
avoid
deportation
recent
decisions
of
the
19member
board
of
immigration
appeals
raised
negative
reactions
from
critics
but
applause
from
supporters
of
lessstringent
immigration
policies
more
than
five
years
ago
congress
stiffened
laws
that
require
foreigners
to
be
deported
if
they
are
convicted
of
a
serious
crime
the
quasiindependent
board
reviews
decisions
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
as
well
as
federal
immigration
courts
in
a
recent
controversial
case
the
board
stopped
the
deportation
of
a
haitian
nanny
convicted
in
the
beating
death
of
the
18monthold
child
in
her
care
melanie
jeanbeaucejour
44
was
sentenced
to
a
maximum
of
six
years
for
seconddegree
manslaughter
in
new
york
in
1995
and
released
two
years
later
the
ins
moved
to
deport
her
and
won
backing
from
a
federal
immigration
judge
in
march
however
the
appeals
board
blocked
her
removal
in
a
decision
reported
in
the
washington
times
and
that
remains
under
seal
the
newspaper
reported
that
a
threemember
panel
from
the
board
blocked
the
deportation
because
it
would
cause
her
family
and
her
americanborn
children
severe
emotional
hardship
the
board
has
determined
that
the
crime
that
she
was
convicted
of
does
not
automatically
require
her
deportation
appeals
board
spokesman
rick
kenney
said
late
last
week
the
board
says
this
crime
does
not
meet
the
conditions
established
in
law
as
a
crime
of
violence
kenney
is
an
official
with
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
which
includes
both
the
immigration
courts
and
the
appeals
board
in
december
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
agreed
to
consider
an
ins
request
to
overrule
the
appeals
board
on
jeanbeaucejour
a
justice
department
spokesman
said
friday
that
the
matter
was
still
under
review
the
immigration
appeals
board
most
of
whose
members
were
appointed
during
the
tenure
of
janet
reno
as
attorney
general
under
president
bill
clinton
has
changed
its
makeup
in
the
last
decade
most
of
the
members
once
came
from
law
enforcement
and
prosecution
backgrounds
but
reno
added
several
board
members
from
immigrant
advocacy
groups
and
universities
the
clintonera
change
was
welcomed
by
advocacy
groups
for
immigrants
even
as
critics
complain
the
board
now
leans
too
heavily
toward
aliens
most
of
the
boards
estimated
30000
annual
rulings
are
not
circulated
widely
although
a
few
are
published
as
precedents
for
the
immigration
courts
among
the
recently
published
decisions
a
korean
national
who
had
been
convicted
of
theft
as
an
18yearold
was
spared
deportation
after
a
judge
trimmed
his
decadeold
oneyear
suspended
sentence
from
a
year
back
to
360
days
at
less
than
a
year
the
suspended
sentence
no
longer
was
grounds
for
automatic
deportation
that
solution
was
accepted
by
the
immigration
appeals
board
in
september
and
posted
on
the
justice
departments
internet
site
its
a
great
proalien
proimmigrant
decision
because
theres
been
a
lot
of
setbacks
for
criminal
aliens
john
t
riely
said
riely
is
the
lawyer
for
min
song
who
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence
for
stealing
fire
extinguishers
in
a
halloween
prank
what
the
board
is
saying
is
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
fix
it
if
possible
riely
said
he
said
he
has
received
dozens
of
calls
from
lawyers
and
clients
who
want
to
pursue
the
same
strategy
in
a
related
case
issued
in
march
2001
the
appeals
board
halted
the
deportation
of
a
belize
citizen
who
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
for
burglary
and
unlawful
sexual
intercourse
with
a
minor
in
1998
the
board
said
that
robin
juraine
crammond
no
longer
fell
under
the
mandated
removal
provisions
of
the
law
because
more
than
a
year
after
his
conviction
the
state
of
california
reduced
his
sex
crime
from
a
felony
to
a
misdemeanor
and
in
yet
another
published
case
the
appeals
board
decided
in
may
that
a
mexican
national
who
was
convicted
of
drunken
driving
for
the
third
time
could
be
granted
the
protection
of
resident
status
as
the
husband
of
a
us
citizen
the
appeals
board
ruled
that
drunken
driving
was
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
and
thus
does
not
exclude
him
from
residential
status
in
arizona
such
rulings
have
raised
questions
among
critics
who
long
have
charged
the
us
government
with
weak
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
one
of
the
weakest
links
in
enforcement
is
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
mike
hethmon
said
hethmon
is
counsel
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
group
that
favors
restrictions
on
immigration
most
of
the
outrageous
cases
that
you
hear
coming
out
of
the
immigration
courts
tend
to
be
influenced
by
the
immigration
appeals
board
he
said
however
nadine
wettstein
a
lawyer
with
the
american
immigration
law
foundation
countered
that
the
appeals
board
continues
to
decide
against
aliens
in
most
cases
wettstein
noted
that
the
board
recently
rejected
a
plea
from
her
group
to
provide
an
englishlanguage
interpreter
for
an
indian
citizen
who
is
seeking
asylum
groups
such
as
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
are
just
used
to
the
board
issuing
decisions
that
are
not
protective
of
immigrant
rights
wettstein
said
so
when
there
are
some
few
that
do
they
get
a
little
bent
out
of
shape
on
the
web
