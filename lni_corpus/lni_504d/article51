your
recent
editorial
nothing
special
is
wrong
and
misleading
the
senates
immigration
bill
repeats
mistakes
by
granting
legalization
before
the
implementation
of
border
security
and
interior
enforcement
it
also
contains
a
special
pathway
to
citizenship
by
creating
an
entirely
new
way
for
unlawful
immigrants
to
become
us
citizens
house
republicans
agree
with
our
colleagues
in
the
senate
that
we
need
to
reform
our
nations
broken
immigration
laws
but
we
are
taking
a
different
approach
to
make
sure
we
avoid
the
mistakes
of
the
1986
immigration
law
which
got
us
into
this
mess
in
the
first
place
for
the
past
six
months
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
taken
a
stepbystep
approach
to
immigration
reform
thoroughly
and
methodically
examining
each
component
in
detail
while
we
look
for
solutions
to
bring
those
residing
in
the
us
unlawfully
out
of
the
shadows
we
must
also
ensure
that
we
take
away
the
immigration
enforcement
onoff
switch
from
the
president
unfortunately
the
senate
bill
doesnt
do
this
and
it
actually
makes
the
problem
worse
by
halting
immigration
enforcement
for
a
period
of
time
creating
enforcementfree
zones
and
granting
the
executive
branch
unilateral
authority
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
when
and
where
it
is
deemed
fit
the
house
judiciary
committee
recently
approved
the
safe
act
to
remedy
this
issue
by
granting
states
the
authority
to
enforce
immigration
laws
in
the
future
as
long
as
their
efforts
are
consistent
with
federal
law
contrary
to
your
assumptions
this
interior
enforcement
component
isnt
intended
to
stand
alone
but
is
one
piece
of
a
larger
immigration
reform
strategy
as
the
committee
continues
this
process
we
intend
to
look
at
proposals
to
address
other
issues
within
our
immigration
system
including
proposals
to
legalize
people
who
are
living
here
illegally
