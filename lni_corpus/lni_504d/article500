united
states
and
to
capture
and
expel

who
sell
illegal

other
crimes

the
agency
and
in
interviews
with
officials
of
the
immigration
service
and
the
justice
department
the
report
says
that
in
recent
years
76
percent
of
all
aliens
under
final
orders
of
deportation
failed
to
surrender

directed
to
do
so
and
it
describes
this
figure
as
alarming
nationwide

immigration
service
has
the
names
of
42200
aliens
convicted
of
crimes
and
92800
aliens
suspected

criminal

all
aliens
even
those
convicted

serious
crimes
are
entitled
to
a
series
of
administrative
hearings
and
judicial
appeals
before
they
can
be
deported

17
million
and
290
new
employees
for
its
effort
to
stop
international
terrorists
before
they
set
foot
on
american
soil
according
to
the
confidential
budget
documents
the
request
marks
the
first
time
that
the
government
has
explicitly
invoked
terrorism
as
a
reason
for
stepping
up
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
some
of
the
proposals
are
subject
to
approval
by
congress
others
can
be
carried
out
by
the
immigration
service
alone
despite
the
general
climate
of
fiscal
austerity
in
washington
the
justice
departments
component
agencies
including
the
immigration
service

said
the
proposals
were
part
of

reagans
campaign
against
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
in
the
report
the
immigration
service
says
a
growing
number
of
criminal
aliens
pose
a
threat
to
the
wellbeing
and
security
of
citizens
throughout
the
united
states
the
report
says
that
despite
the
staggering
workload
of
criminal
alien
cases
the
immigration
service
has
26
percent
fewer
investigators
today
than
in
1976
the
number
declined
to
690
from
935
in
its
budget
request
the
immigration
agency
said
it
was
in
a
unique
position
to
combat
terrorism
because
it
is
the
single
agency
in
the
federal
government
best
equipped
to
keep
foreign
terrorists
from
entering
immigration
inspectors
at
ports
of
entry
and
border
patrol
agents
between
ports
are
the
nations
first
line
of
defense
against
terrorism
it
said
the
immigration
service
is
seeking
110
additional
inspectors
at
a
cost
of
47
million
a
year
for
its
antiterrorist
program
in
addition
it
is
seeking
43
million
in
additional
funds
for
the

patrol
39
million
to
fight
alien
smuggling
rings
17
million
for
intelligence
and
16
million
for
computer
and
communications
equipment
the
immigration
service
currently
does
not
have
any
resources
specially
earmarked
for
combating
terrorism
nor
did
it
count
the
number
of
terrorism
suspects
among
the
12
million
illegal
aliens
apprehended
last
year
verne

a
spokesman
for
the
immigration
agency
said
the
number
was
probably
no
more
than
20

terrorist
incidents
in
the
united
states
has
declined
for
several
years
