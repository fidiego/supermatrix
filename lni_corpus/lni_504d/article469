under
pressure
to
reduce
an
unprecedented
backlog
of
citizenship
applications
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
yesterday
announced
measures
that
agency
officials
said
would
cut
in
half
the
time
immigrants
must
wait
to
become
united
states
citizens
the
measures
range
from
creating
a
national
customer
service
office
to
help
improve
the
agencys
performance
to
asking
congress
for
171
million
to
hire
200
new
employees
and
increase
overtime
hours
agency
officials
also
said
they
would
more
than
double
the
filing
fee
for
citizenship
applications
to
225
from
95
and
create
a
national
telephone
line
staffed
by
500
people
to
answer
routine
questions
about
immigration
services
according
to
the
plan
which
was
detailed
by
the
ins
commissioner
doris
m
meissner
much
of
the
money
would
be
used
to
send
teams
of
experts
to
work
in
the
five
cities
that
have
the
highest
number
of
pending
citizenship
cases

immigration
officials
said
the
current
backlog
of
19
million
cases
nationwide
was
the
result
of
an
inefficient
antiquated
system
and
a
soaring
number
of
applications
prompted
by
recent
laws
that
threaten
to
reduce
benefits
to
noncitizens
in
some
parts
of
the
country
applicants
must
wait
more
than
two
years
to
become
citizens
said
an
ins
spokesman
in
washington
russell
a
bergeron
jr
just
two
years
ago
the
waiting
time
was
six
months
with
the
new
plan
immigration
officials
expect
that
a
year
from
now
immigrants
will
have
to
wait
only
10
months
to
a
year
to
become
citizens
except
for
the
request
for
money
which
would
require
congressional
approval
the
measures
would
begin
to
be
implemented
immediately
the
request
is
likely
to
be
approved
because
immigration
officials
said
the
money
was
already
part
of
the
budget
for
the
justice
department
which
oversees
the
ins
the
agencys
lawyers
and
advocates
for
immigrants
reacted
to
the
announcement
with
caution
money
is
not
going
to
help
the
situation
said
jesus
pena
an
immigration
lawyer
in
queens
immigration
has
already
lost
sight
of
its
mission
and
you
cant
bring
that
back
by
throwing
money
at
an
agency
mr
pena
pointed
to
his
most
recent
experience
with
the
immigration
agency
as
the
reason
for
his
lack
of
optimism
he
said
he
went
to
the
immigration
office
in
garden
city
nj
yesterday
morning
to
find
out
why
his
client
luz
galindo
had
not
heard
from
the
agency
since
she
applied
for
citizenship
two
years
ago
he
was
told
that
inexplicably
her
file
was
in
detroit
how
much
money
how
much
sophistication
does
it
take
to
bring
a
file
from
detroit
to
new
jersey
mr
pena
asked
members
of
congress
have
criticized
the
ins
for
rushing
to
naturalize
people
without
proper
background
checks
while
advocates
for
immigrants
criticize
it
for
taking
too
long
to
process
applications
leonard
glickman
executive
vice
president
of
the
hebrew
immigrant
aid
society
in
new
york
said
that
he
was
hopeful
and
optimistic
about
the
new
measures
but
that
he
did
not
understand
why
the
agency
would
raise
filing
fees
when
the
level
of
service
remained
poor
