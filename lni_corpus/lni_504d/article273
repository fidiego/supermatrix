the
governors
of
the
states
most
heavily
impacted
by
illegal
immigration
texas
new
mexico
arizona
and
california
met
recently
in
austin
texas
and
agreed
that
congress
must
reform
the
nations
immigration
laws
dont
put
it
off
do
it
now
these
governors
two
democrats
and
two
republicans
want
congress
to
put
partisan
politics
aside
stop
holding
meaningless
immigration
hearings
around
the
nation
and
take
action
to
relieve
states
and
cities
of
the
burden
of
a
federal
responsibility
so
far
colorado
utah
georgia
pennsylvania
and
louisiana
have
passed
state
laws
attempting
to
deal
with
illegal
immigration
other
states
are
contemplating
their
own
bills
also
cities
and
communities
around
the
nation
are
enacting
local
immigration
laws
that
are
often
punitive
likely
unconstitutional
and
should
be
handled
by
congress
the
pennsylvania
communities
of
hazleton
allentown
shenandoah
and
mount
pocono
also
have
been
reported
to
be
at
various
stages
of
assuming
immigration
duties
that
belong
to
the
federal
government
according
to
a
usa
today
article
lou
barletta
the
mayor
of
hazleton
has
been
contacted
by
officials
from
30
towns
asking
for
a
copy
of
the
citys
law
which
likely
will
be
met
with
multiple
lawsuits
for
trying
to
chase
illegal
immigrants
out
of
town
the
border
governors
state
legislatures
various
city
officials
around
the
country
and
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
american
people
are
all
in
agreement
that
congress
should
enact
immigration
reforms
its
still
possible
to
force
the
republican
leaders
in
the
gopcontrolled
congress
to
take
up
an
overhaul
of
the
nations
ineffective
immigration
laws
this
year
but
it
will
take
a
push
from
president
bush
and
other
republicans
to
put
a
bipartisan
need
ahead
of
an
electionyear
political
agenda
bush
made
sweeping
immigration
reforms
a
key
part
of
his
presidential
agenda
early
in
his
first
administration
he
continues
to
support
immigration
reform
that
includes
some
method
to
match
foreign
workers
with
american
employers
whose
businesses
depend
on
foreign
workers
the
bush
plan
is
opposed
by
a
group
of
house
republican
leaders
who
prefer
punishment
for
the
12
million
or
so
illegal
immigrants
now
living
in
the
united
states
rather
than
solutions
that
allow
needed
foreign
workers
to
work
legally
and
eventually
earn
citizenship
the
house
and
senate
have
both
passed
immigration
bills
the
senates
version
which
enjoys
strong
bipartisan
support
is
in
line
with
bushs
longstanding
effort
to
provide
a
legal
mechanism
enabling
us
employers
to
hire
foreign
workers
if
they
demonstrate
that
they
could
not
fill
those
jobs
with
us
citizens
recently
a
large
group
of
influential
texas
business
leaders
representing
agriculture
food
processing
hospitality
construction
banking
and
other
businesses
joined
to
urge
passage
of
immigration
legislation
that
recognizes
how
vital
immigrant
labor
is
to
the
economy
the
people
in
those
countries
where
we
are
trying
to
establish
democracies
might
need
a
little
extra
convincing
when
they
notice
how
elected
leaders
in
the
united
states
act
as
if
they
do
not
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
will
of
the
people
who
elected
them
immigration
is
federal
responsibility
congress
should
pass
immigration
reform
this
year
