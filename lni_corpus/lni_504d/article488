investigations
of
people
by
immigration
agents
merely
because
their
names
sound
foreign
is
unconstitutional
a
federal
appeals
court
ruled
on
friday
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
also
took
the
unusual
step
of
overturning
an
order
for
the
deportation
of
a
nigerian
man
because
it
found
a
serious
constitutional
violation
in
the
seizure
of
the
man
in
an
apartment
building
and
the
search
of
his
room
the
man
jacob
orhorhaghe
was
called
to
an
immigration
investigators
attention
by
a
bank
employee
because
his
name
sounded
nigerian
the
court
said
one
cannot
rationally
or
reliably
predict
whether
an
individual
is
an
illegal
alien
based
on
the
sound
of
his
name
judge
stephen
reinhardt
wrote
in
the
3to0
ruling
many
if
not
all
americans
have
foreignsounding
names
depending
on
which
countries
of
origin
we
consider
foreign

californians
will
vote
on
an
initiative
that
would
require
state
and
local
officials
health
workers
and
educators
to
report
to
immigration
authorities
anyone
they
reasonably
suspected
of
being
an
illegal
immigrant
the
ruling
on
mr
orhorhaghes
case
should
send
a
message
to
those
responsible
for
enforcing
the
initiative
proposition
187
said
his
lawyer
james
mayock
the
proponents
think
you
know
an
illegal
alien
when
you
see
him
mr
mayock
said
he
said
the
ruling
was
a
protection
for
people
who
might
have
foreignsounding
names
he
said
mr
orhorhaghe
was
married
to
a
united
states
citizen
and
was
seeking
legal
resident
status
mr
orhorhaghe
entered
the
united
states
legally
in
october
1982
on
a
tourist
visa
that
expired
18
days
later
the
court
said
he
was
living
in
oakland
in
1986
when
his
name
was
referred
to
an
immigration
officer
by
karen
muth
a
bank
of
america
investigator
who
had
encountered
it
during
a
credit
card
fraud
investigation
and
thought
it
sounded
nigerian
michael
smirnoff
an
investigator
with
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
decided
to
investigate
mr
orhorhaghe
after
failing
to
find
his
name
in
a
computerized
list
of
those
who
had
legally
entered
the
country
after
january
1983
the
court
said
mr
smirnoff
ms
muth
another
immigration
agent
and
a
police
officer
went
to
mr
orhorhaghes
apartment
building
mr
smirnoff
who
was
carrying
a
concealed
gun
told
mr
orhorhaghe
that
they
did
not
need
a
warrant
the
court
said
they
opened
his
briefcase
and
found
documents
referring
to
his
expired
visa
the
court
said
an
immigration
judge
ruled
that
the
search
was
illegal
but
he
was
overruled
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
ordered
mr
orhorhaghe
deported
the
appeals
court
overturned
that
order
saying
the
case
was
a
rare
example
of
an
egregious
constitutional
violation
that
required
the
barring
of
evidence
in
an
immigration
case
judge
reinhardt
said
mr
orhorhaghe
had
been
investigated
by
the
immigration
service
solely
because
of
his
name
his
absence
from
the
list
of
legal
entrants
since
january
1983
provided
no
additional
evidence
that
he
was
an
illegal
immigrant
judge
reinhardt
said
citing
a
1975
supreme
court
ruling
that
barred
agents
of
the
immigration
service
from
detaining
people
because
they
looked
hispanic
the
judge
said
an
investigation
prompted
by
a
foreignsounding
name
was
equally
improper
and
was
ultimately
based
on
race
or
national
origin
