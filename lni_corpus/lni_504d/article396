a
congressional
commission
wednesday
will
propose
a
fundamental
revamping
of
the
nations
immigration
laws
ultimately
lowering
the
number
of
foreigners
allowed
to
move
into
the
country
by
onethird
but
promising
in
return
to
speed
the
admission
of
spouses
and
young
children
of
legal
aliens
the
report
by
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
could
trigger
a
major
debate
by
congress
on
immigration
policy
if
enacted
the
commissions
proposals
would
drastically
reorder
who
could
get
into
the
united
states
and
who
couldnt
the
commission
headed
by
former
representative
barbara
jordan
dtex
over
a
period
of
years
would
gradually
reduce
the
annual
number
of
legal
immigrants
from
the
current
level
of
about
830000
first
to
700000
and
then
to
550000
the
panel
also
recommends
new
restrictions
on
the
admission
of
unskilled
workers
and
would
impose
special
fees
on
employers
who
bring
skilled
workers
into
the
country
news
of
the
commissions
proposals
was
warmly
received
by
those
who
have
argued
that
immigration
is
having
a
negative
impact
on
the
nation
this
is
a
recognition
that
the
system
is
broken
a
recognition
that
we
need
to
bring
immigration
down
said
daniel
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
group
that
has
advocated
even
sharper
cuts
in
the
flow
of
immigrants
a
source
close
to
the
commission
said
however
that
the
ninemember
panel
believed
that
basic
us
immigration
policy
was
fine
but
the
commission
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
there
were
major
problems
in
the
current
policy
and
wanted
to
be
involved
in
congressional
efforts
to
rewrite
immigration
laws
the
source
said
jordan
will
come
to
washington
on
wednesday
to
hold
a
news
conference
and
brief
congressional
leaders
on
the
panels
recommendations
the
commissions
proposals
were
disclosed
by
the
san
francisco
chronicle
and
the
new
york
times
despite
the
commissions
efforts
to
avoid
controversy
what
you
will
get
are
fights
said
michael
fix
an
immigration
policy
analyst
at
the
urban
institute
a
washington
think
tank
noting
that
the
commissions
proposal
parallels
legislation
being
drafted
by
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
chairman
of
the
senate
immigration
subcommittee
fix
predicted
that
the
report
will
give
momentum
to
an
issue
that
some
gop
leaders
had
hoped
to
avoid
while
they
focused
on
their
primary
legislative
agenda
based
on
recent
immigration
statistics
analysts
said
yesterday
that
the
commissions
proposals
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
many
latinos
and
asians
to
gain
visas
to
enter
the
county
both
groups
have
benefited
from
preferences
that
have
allowed
brothers
sisters
and
adult
children
to
join
their
relatives
who
have
become
us
citizens
advocates
of
tighter
restrictions
argue
that
the
current
preference
system
promotes
daisy
chain
immigration
that
allows
for
big
extended
families
to
gain
admission
warren
r
leiden
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
was
the
lone
dissenter
on
several
key
commission
votes
taken
during
closed
meetings
this
spring
the
final
recommendations
of
the
majority
are
not
well
enough
thought
through
and
are
shortsighted
he
said
congressional
republicans
have
been
sharply
divided
over
the
issue
with
some
favoring
immigration
controls
and
others
including
house
majority
leader
richard
k
armey
rtex
arguing
that
controls
do
more
economic
harm
than
good
it
was
unclear
yesterday
how
the
clinton
administration
would
respond
cecilia
munoz
deputy
vice
president
at
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
latino
group
said
her
organization
would
fight
the
proposal
because
of
the
recommended
changes
in
family
preferences
the
impact
is
going
to
be
on
americans
who
want
to
bring
their
families
together
she
said
accusing
the
commission
of
crafting
proposals
to
win
favor
on
capitol
hill
what
was
clearly
a
thoughtful
body
has
turned
into
one
that
is
being
driving
by
politics
munoz
said
a
commission
official
conceded
that
munoz
may
have
a
point
were
a
congressional
commission
what
do
you
think
a
congressional
commission
does

official
