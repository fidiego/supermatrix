you
might
not
think
of
dayton
as
a
hot
spot
when
it
comes
to
enforcing
our
nations
immigration
laws
but
when
i
became
police
chief
in
2008
immigration
enforcement
was
the
first
major
issue
i
faced
our
need
for
a
new
immigration
process
to
replace
our
broken
system
has
not
ebbed
here
in
dayton
we
have
encountered
concerns
about
racial
profiling
enforcing
federal
statutes
and
the
social
dilemmas
caused
when
deportations
leave
families
torn
apart
we
need
a
new
immigration
process
one
that
restores
respect
to
the
rule
of
law
allows
for
productive
and
effective
policing
of
our
local
communities
and
honors
the
values
of
freedom
and
hard
work
that
generations
of
new
americans
have
come
here
to
pursue
thats
why
i
have
added
my
voice
to
the
growing
chorus
coming
from
all
corners
of
the
country
calling
on
congress
to
act
on
immigration
reform
as
soon
as
possible
this
fall
the
house
of
representatives
must
find
a
way
forward
on
reform
that
adheres
to
our
values
and
moves
us
forward
during
congress
august
recess
i
was
proud
to
join
faith
and
business
leaders
here
to
call
for
broad
immigration
reform
that
acknowledges
the
dignity
of
each
person
effectively
regulates
the
entry
and
stay
of
immigrants
in
this
country
and
addresses
the
needs
of
the
american
economy
not
just
here
but
around
the
country
similar
groups
of
bibles
badges
and
business
leaders
organized
dozens
of
districtlevel
events
to
support
members
of
congress
and
urge
reform
from
the
law
enforcement
perspective
we
need
reform
to
remove
barriers
to
community
policing
and
to
use
our
limited
resources
effectively
our
current
system
puts
too
much
of
the
onus
of
enforcing
national
immigration
laws
on
local
law
enforcement
that
is
the
job
of
the
federal
government
local
law
enforcement
officers
dont
have
the
training
time
or
resources
to
fulfill
that
mission
effectively
as
a
police
chief
i
fully
understand
prioritization
and
our
current
immigration
enforcement
and
deportation
system
does
not
fit
the
bill
the
people
who
pose
a
risk
to
our
country
and
our
communities
are
not
the
ones
who
are
being
deported
certainly
not
the
only
ones
fixing
our
legal
immigration
system
will
reduce
illegal
immigration
give
our
government
control
over
the
process
and
reduce
the
harmful
practice
of
criminal
smuggling
we
cant
have
a
part
of
our
community
thats
afraid
to
call
the
police
that
encourages
crime
rather
than
helping
us
prevent
it
turning
state
and
local
police
into
immigration
enforcers
as
one
bill
under
house
consideration
would
mandate
is
clearly
not
the
answer
not
only
does
it
misdirect
resources
but
it
creates
barriers
within
our
community
to
public
safety
where
trust
is
essential
public
safety
increases
when
everyone
in
the
community
can
trust
and
be
confident
in
their
police
department
not
worried
that
calling
us
could
land
the
caller
a
family
member
or
a
friend
in
immigration
detention
our
relationship
to
our
community
is
crucial
our
broken
immigration
system
along
with
efforts
to
engage
local
law
enforcement
in
immigration
enforcement
undermines
our
mission
as
it
stands
our
immigration
system
forces
our
hardworking
neighbors
to
live
in
the
shadows
and
it
tears
families
apart
aspiring
americans
are
part
of
our
communities
and
deserve
to
be
treated
with
dignity
and
given
an
opportunity
to
contribute
fully
to
our
country
if
we
dont
address
the
people
who
are
here
unlawfully
we
still
will
not
have
solved
the
problem
when
undocumented
immigrants
without
criminal
backgrounds
are
registered
and
have
legal
status
we
in
law
enforcement
can
focus
our
resources
on
criminals
or
more
serious
violators
reform
must
provide
immigrants
with
an
opportunity
to
earn
legal
status
and
eventual
citizenship
and
the
moment
is
now
bipartisan
immigration
reform
has
momentum
unrivaled
by
any
other
issue
and
the
house
of
representatives
must
continue
to
move
responsible
reform
forward
dayton
is
a
welcoming
community
for
immigrants
and
we
are
the
better
for
it
its
no
wonder
that
faith
law
enforcement
and
business
leaders
here
and
elsewhere
are
stepping
up
to
help
congress
get
to
yes
on
immigration
reform
the
sooner
they
act
the
sooner
our
community
and
others
will
be
safer
and
stronger
under
a
new
immigration
process
that
honors
our
values
for
our
communities
and
our
country
we
need
broad
immigration
reform
