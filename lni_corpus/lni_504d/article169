county
authorities
released
four
suspected
illegal
immigrants
they
detained
after
it
was
determined
that
no
state
charges
could
be
leveled
against
them
and
federal
officials
showed
no
interest
as
district
attorney
general
russell
johnson
noted
state
and
local
agencies
have
no
authority
or
ability
to
deport
illegal
aliens
so
they
were
released
at
the
same
time
the
state
legislature
was
moving
forward
with
a
bill
that
would
authorize
tennessee
county
jailers
to
determine
the
immigration
status
of
their
inmates
its
now
headed
to
gov
phil
bredesens
desk
for
his
signature
the
bill
however
is
similar
to
an
existing
federal
program
the
knox
county
sheriffs
office
has
joined
it
also
contains
a
serious
flaw
that
could
expose
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
charges
of
racial
profiling
the
sheriffs
office
is
the
first
law
enforcement
agency
in
tennessee
to
become
a
member
of
the
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcements
secure
communities
program
as
a
member
the
sheriffs
office
will
send
the
fingerprints
of
all
suspects
incarcerated
in
its
facilities
to
the
ice
the
program
targets
highpriority
violent
foreign
nationals
a
key
component
of
the
program
is
that
information
is
shared
about
all
suspects
regardless
of
suspicions
of
their
immigration
status
information
on
a
sixthgeneration
tennessean
will
be
sent
along
with
information
on
a
foreign
national
whose
immigration
status
is
unknown
it
would
be
up
to
the
ice
not
the
sheriffs
office
to
determine
whether
a
suspect
is
here
legally
or
not
a
provision
of
the
bill
passed
by
the
legislature
however
calls
for
the
sharing
of
information
if
the
keeper
of
the
jail
determines
that
the
individual
is
in
violation
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
or
if
such
status
cannot
be
determined
in
other
words
it
would
be
up
to
the
jailer
to
decide
whether
to
turn
over
information
racial
and
ethnic
profiling
intentional
or
not
would
be
a
constant
risk
the
bill
is
also
unnecessary
another
federal
program
the
knox
county
sheriffs
office
has
joined
makes
the
agency
a
partner
with
ice
the
287g
program
named
after
a
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
authorizes
participating
agencies
to
have
local
officers
trained
as
immigration
officers
with
full
authority
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
ice
officers
would
supervise
them
when
they
exercise
their
immigration
authority
the
ice
program
is
far
superior
to
the
bill
currently
headed
toward
the
governors
desk
the
bill
calls
for
the
tennessee
peace
officer
standards
and
training
commission
to
come
up
with
the
processes
jailers
are
to
follow
when
determining
immigration
status
in
the
287
g
program
ice
provides
training
programs
for
local
officers
the
ice
academy
sets
standards
and
testing
and
only
certified
instructors
conduct
the
training
bredesen
should
veto
the
bill
now
before
him
and
encourage
local
agencies
to
follow
knox
countys
lead
in
working
with
the
federal
government
on
immigration
enforcement
