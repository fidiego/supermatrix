a
new
labor
department
study
says
that
women
and
children
account
for
twothirds
of
all
legal
immigration
to
the
united
states
contrary
to
conventional
wisdom
the
stereotypical
view
of
immigrants
as
young
workingage
men
who
leave
their
homelands
seeking
economic
opportunity
is
a
correct
picture
of
immigration
in
nearly
all
other
countries
the
report
said
but
it
said
that
in
recent
years
as
in
the
last
five
decades
the
traditional
workingage
immigrant
male
has
accounted
for
only
a
third
of
all
immigration
to
the
united
states
the
american
trend
had
gone
virtually
unnoticed
by
researchers
and
government
officials
but
may
have
major
implications
for
immigration
policy
if
the
number
of
immigrants
entering
the
labor
market
is
smaller
than
had
been
assumed
the
adverse
effect
on
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
american
workers
would
be
less
than
many
people
had
believed
on
the
other
hand
immigration
would
probably
not
generate
as
much
economic
growth
if
there
were
fewer
immigrants
working
in
this
country
the
authors
said
they
were
surprised
by
the
findings
of
the
study
the
first
to
compile
and
analyze
immigration
data
by
sex
in
view
of
the
new
data
they
said
the
effect
of
immigration
on
the
american
labor
market
may
have
been
overestimated
and
almost
certainly
has
been
miscast
pattern
called
unique
legal
immigration
averaged
433600
a
year
in
the
1970s
and
the
annual
average
has
been
566600
in
the
last
five
years
since
1930
it
said
more
than
half
of
all
immigrants
to
the
united
states
have
been
female
and
twothirds
have
been
women
or
children
the
unvarying
predominance
of
female
immigrants
appears
unique
it
said
other
international
migration
flows
are
still
generally
dominated
by
males
officials
had
assumed
that
most
immigrants
went
to
work
soon
after
entering
the
united
states
actually
the
study
said
children
represent
onefourth
of
all
immigrants
and
elderly
immigrants
most
of
whom
are
women
may
never
enter
the
labor
market
jeffrey
s
passel
a
census
bureau
demographer
who
specializes
in
immigration
said
the
labor
department
study
showed
that
the
traditional
picture
of
immigration
is
different
from
the
reality
over
the
last
50
years
the
dominance
of
women
and
children
he
said
is
a
point
that
almost
everybody
has
overlooked
the
study
was
written
by
marion
f
houstoun
roger
g
kramer
and
joan
m
barrett
immigration
specialists
at
the
labor
department
authors
cite
reasons
for
pattern
they
listed
several
reasons
for
the
female
predominance
in
immigration
to
this
country
united
states
immigration
policy
strongly
favors
reunification
of
families
they
observed
immigration
laws
have
become
more
restrictive
over
the
last
50
years
they
said
but
there
is
no
numerical
limit
on
immigration
of
aliens
who
are
immediate
relatives
of
united
states
citizens
most
of
the
immediate
relatives
are
women
because
american
men
are
much
more
likely
than
women
to
marry
aliens
in
addition
the
study
said
more
mothers
than
fathers
immigrated
to
the
united
states
to
be
reunited
with
their
us
citizen
children
women
tend
to
live
longer
than
men
it
noted
and
most
of
the
women
immigrants
in
this
category
were
widowed
mothers
joining
their
children
in
the
united
states
united
states
citizens
also
adopted
more
girls
than
boys
from
overseas
the
study
said
that
more
girls
were
available
for
adoption
from
abroad
and
that
americans
seeking
to
adopt
aliens
showed
an
overwhelming
preference
for
girls
the
authors
said
they
did
not
know
the
reason
for
this
preference
roger
l
conner
the
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
nonprofit
group
that
lobbies
for
more
restrictive
immigration
policies
said
the
study
showed
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
immigrants
who
enter
the
united
states
today
come
to
complete
a
family
rather
than
to
work
little
data
on
illegal
migrants
the
study
which
is
being
published
in
the
international
migration
review
a
professional
journal
did
not
discuss
illegal
immigration
for
which
there
are
no
authoritative
statistics
mrs
houstoun
said
in
an
interview
this
week
illegal
immigration
is
dominated
by
men
however
in
recent
years
there
seem
to
be
increasing
numbers
of
illegal
alien
women
and
the
proportion
of
women
among
illegal
migrants
is
also
increasing
the
labor
department
study
said
that
women
dominated
legal
immigration
to
the
united
states
from
europe
and
southeast
asia
while
men
dominated
immigration
from
africa
and
the
middle
east
in
the
last
decade
it
said
women
accounted
for
72
percent
of
the
immigrants
from
finland
and
west
germany
69
percent
of
those
from
thailand
67
percent
from
japan
and
62
percent
from
sweden
by
contrast
women
accounted
for
only
13
percent
of
immigration
from
yemen
32
percent
from
nigeria
and
34
percent
from
