media
httpwwwnewamericamediaorg
a
national
association
of
ethnic
media
and
was
published
by
more
than
50
ethnic
media
across
the
country
to
bring
attention
to
the
urgency
of
immigration
reform
the
white
house
and
congress
must
move
quickly
to
enact
just
and
humane
comprehensive
immigration
reform
in
the
wake
of
the
2012
elections
both
democratic
and
republican
lawmakers
have
expressed
the
need
to
act
on
the
issue
the
window
for
bipartisan
legislation
is
now
open
ethnic
media
have
a
high
stake
in
the
future
of
immigration
policy
in
this
country
thats
why
we
are
joining
together
to
take
an
editorial
stand
to
urge
congress
and
the
white
house
make
2013
the
year
of
immigration
reform
this
is
not
merely
a
question
of
politics
we
are
calling
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
because
it
is
the
morally
right
economically
wise
and
pragmatically
sensible
thing
to
do
our
country
is
a
nation
of
laws
and
it
is
clear
that
us
immigration
laws
need
to
be
overhauled
the
immigration
system
is
broken
not
only
for
the
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
but
for
the
thousands
of
immigrants
who
are
unable
to
get
visas
to
work
in
the
united
states
for
american
businesses
that
cant
hire
the
workers
they
need
for
the
families
who
wait
for
years
to
get
visas
to
join
their
relatives
in
the
united
states
we
need
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
will
reunite
families
reinvigorate
the
economy
and
revive
our
identity
as
a
nation
that
thrives
on
the
contributions
of
hardworking
immigrants
its
clear
that
our
federal
immigration
laws
are
not
working
federal
inaction
on
immigration
has
led
states
from
arizona
to
alabama
to
write
their
own
legislation
even
the
recently
announced
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
daca
program
is
a
temporary
bandaid
that
does
nothing
to
solve
the
larger
problem
of
a
broken
immigration
system
immigration
has
been
portrayed
as
a
divisive
issue
in
reality
its
not
all
of
us
would
benefit
from
an
effective
immigration
system
that
responds
to
the
needs
of
the
market
protects
all
workers
from
abuse
and
exploitation
and
puts
an
end
to
the
practice
of
separating
parents
from
their
children
we
need
an
immigration
system
that
reflects
the
best
traditions
of
our
history
our
belief
in
justice
equality
and
economic
opportunity
and
as
we
look
to
the
future
we
must
make
sure
that
we
remain
competitive
in
an
increasingly
globalized
world
we
need
to
continue
to
attract
the
best
and
the
brightest
to
be
the
destination
of
the
worlds
most
innovative
workers
we
must
act
now
our
economy
and
our
future
depend
on
it
