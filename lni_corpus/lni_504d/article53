boon
for
lawyers

words
so
sweeping
and
complex
is
the
immigration
bill
set
for
a
final
vote
this
week
in
the
us
senate
that
it
will
bring
an
unintended
bonanza
for
one
american
constituency
the
thousands
of
immigration
lawyers
who
will
be
hired
to
interpret
it
many
of
them
began
gathering
in
san
francisco
on
wednesday
for
an
annual
conference
to
talk
shop
about
americas
immigration
code
a
hefty
tome
that
could
soon
get
even
weightier
and
while
most
law
school
graduates
dont
choose
the
immigration
practice
if
a
big
salary
is
their
aim
the
bipartisan
immigration
bill
is
like
a
permanent
pension
plan
for
immigration
lawyers
said
new
york
attorney
sam
udani
it
is
not
just
the
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
looking
for
expert
help
to
qualify
for
a
proposed
13year
citizenship
path
or
the
silicon
valley
tech
companies
navigating
through
new
rules
for
hiring
foreign
workers
no
udani
said
the
place
where
the
money
is
going
to
be
made
is
everify
the
electronic
worker
verification
that
would
become
mandatory
for
all
us
employers
udani
is
among
the
4000
members
of
theamerican
immigration
lawyers
association
gathering
this
week
at
the
hilton
hotel
in
union
square
their
profession
has
changed
and
greatly
expanded
with
each
new
immigration
overhaul
since
the
1950s
membership
in
the
association
grew
by
11
percent
in
recent
months
amid
the
rising
talk
of
reform
some
are
looking
to
ride
the
expansion
of
employmentbased
immigration
where
attorney
fees
can
range
from
2000
for
a
temporary
tech
workers
application
to
more
than
20000
for
a
wealthy
investor
trying
to
secure
a
green
card
still
humanitarian
concerns
and
a
search
for
a
noble
profession
not
money
drive
many
immigration
lawyers
younger
attorneys
tend
to
be
pretty
idealistic
and
get
into
the
field
in
order
to
help
people
who
are
in
trouble
said
crystal
williams
director
of
the
lawyers
association
and
theres
not
much
more
trouble
you
can
get
into
than
being
in
deportation
proceedings
few
immigrants
fighting
deportation
have
the
means
to
hire
qualified
legal
help
so
the
nonprofit
organizations
that
offer
free
or
lowcost
assistance
are
gearing
up
to
assist
the
millions
living
in
the
country
illegally
who
could
qualify
for
a
provisional
legal
status
and
eventual
citizenship
many
community
organizations
and
foundations
hire
their
own
attorneys
in
part
to
steer
immigrants
away
from
dishonest
lawyers
and
consultants
looking
to
make
easy
money
immigration
law
is
a
very
complicated
area
its
more
complicated
than
the
tax
code
said
angelo
ancheta
a
santa
clara
university
school
of
law
professor
he
directs
the
schools
community
legal
clinic
where
students
help
represent
human
trafficking
victims
and
other
vulnerable
immigrantscfor
many
foreigners
hoping
to
stay
in
the
united
states
its
not
essential
that
you
have
a
lawyer
but
its
a
very
paperworkheavy
very
mazelike
system
he
said
and
the
consequences
of
making
a
mistake
can
be
disastrous
money
is
rarely
the
motive
for
the
40
percent
of
the
groups
lawyers
who
take
on
asylum
or
deportation
cases
williams
said
the
arena
is
certainly
not
lucrative
but
its
very
human
she
said
people
who
like
practicing
immigration
law
like
it
mostly
because
of
the
clients
because
of
the
people
theyre
helping
few
professors
taught
immigration
law
when
williams
graduated
from
law
school
in
1982
and
the
immigration
attorneys
group
was
still
a
tiny
one
focusing
on
an
arcane
niche
of
american
jurisprudence
today
the
organization
counts
nearly
13000
members
and
although
passage
of
an
immigration
overhaul
will
create
new
business
it
will
also
take
some
away
she
said
more
than
half
of
the
associations
lawyers
spend
time
helping
families
sponsor
relatives
for
green
cards
but
the
bill
would
halt
immigration
opportunities
for
siblings
and
adult
children
still
the
reform
measure
will
be
a
boon
to
thousands
of
immigration
lawyers
especially
those
representing
corporate
clientscbut
not
all
of
the
associations
members
believe
what
is
good
for
the
profession
will
be
good
for
the
country
why
are
they
supporting
this
they
see
dollar
signs
said
kenneth
rinzler
an
association
member
since
1992
and
frequent
critic
of
the
groups
leadership
and
lobbying
youre
creating
all
these
new
regulations
the
lawyers
are
going
to
benefit
