mention
immigration
and
many
americans
conjure
up
visions
of
desperate
men
women
and
children
sneaking
across
the
mexican
border
wiggling
their
way
into
american
jobs
and
onto
welfare
its
not
often
one
considers
the
northern
border
of
the
united
states
and
how
it
contributes
to
the
wave
of
legal
and
illegal
immigration
according
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
canada
is
the
fourthlargest
source
of
illegal
immigrants
in
the
united
states
and
proposed
changes
in
immigration
laws
although
aimed
mostly
at
the
southern
border
will
affect
canadians
and
the
northern
border
as
well
true
canadians
are
not
significant
contributors
when
you
look
at
illegal
or
legal
immigration
and
the
big
picture
said
david
hirson
a
california
attorney
who
specializes
in
immigration
law
but
immigration
is
immigration
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
if
proposals
now
in
congress
pass
fees
will
be
charged
people
crossing
back
and
forth
to
canada
increased
border
patrols
could
slow
crossing
times
employers
would
have
to
be
more
careful
in
inspecting
the
documents
of
new
workers
and
legal
immigration
would
be
cut
back
the
ins
estimates
that
of
the
roughly
four
million
illegal
immigrants
living
in
the
united
states
97000
are
from
canada
behind
13
million
from
mexico
327000
from
el
salvador
and
129000
from
guatemala
there
were
17156
legal
canadian
immigrants
in
1992
the
last
year
the
ins
compiled
such
statistics
some
immigration
groups
say
that
large
numbers
of
them
live
in
the
los
angeles
area
and
in
michigan
and
florida
at
least
half
of
the
canadians
in
the
united
states
illegally
entered
the
country
legally
and
then
overstayed
their
visas
said
stan
cannon
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
larry
olson
supervisory
special
agent
with
the
us
immigration
department
in
st
paul
minn
said
the
fact
that
canadians
blend
in
so
well
is
one
reason
why
they
may
not
be
investigated
as
aggressively
as
other
illegal
immigrants
where
we
might
get
information
on
a
group
of
mexicans
working
illegally
here
we
dont
as
much
with
canadians
said
olson
its
just
harder
to
pick
up
on
where
the
illegal
canadians
are
and
who
they
are
still
the
us
border
patrol
office
in
grand
forks
nd
said
that
it
arrested
1237
illegal
immigrants
in
1994
many
of
them
for
using
fraudulent
documents
to
obtain
work
and
that
about
a
fifth
of
them
were
canadians
experts
say
proposals
to
control
legal
immigration
by
requiring
applicants
to
be
able
to
support
themselves
would
not
affect
canadians
much
because
they
tend
to
be
more
educated
and
better
equipped
to
work
when
they
arrive
in
the
united
states
according
to
the
ins
17
percent
of
the
canadians
legally
in
the
united
states
in
1993
held
professional
jobs
while
12
percent
were
classified
as
executives
managers
or
administrators
of
the
126561
legal
mexicans
in
the
united
states
in
1993
less
than
1
percent
held
professional
or
managerial
jobs
