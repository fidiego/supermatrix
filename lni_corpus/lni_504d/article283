heated
debates
over
immigration
policies
are
not
new
to
the
united
states
and
thats
odd
for
a
country
comprised
of
immigrants
each
debate
is
critical
to
each
generation
thats
why
it
was
important
for
president
bush
to
enter
the
current
debate
over
immigration
by
announcing
his
new
immigration
policy
recommendations
it
was
also
important
to
localities
because
immigration
policies
laws
and
the
authority
and
resources
to
enforce
them
begin
and
end
with
the
federal
government
as
far
as
bushs
proposal
is
concerned
all
sides
dont
like
it
which
means
there
must
be
something
for
everyone
to
like
bushs
immigration
initiative
correctly
addresses
two
important
considerations
the
first
is
recognition
that
rounding
up
for
deportation
the
estimated
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
already
here
is
more
difficult
and
more
expensive
than
the
united
states
debtbulging
federal
budget
can
afford
the
other
is
the
cost
to
many
of
americas
local
economies
that
rely
on
this
labor
force
for
delivery
of
goods
and
services
debate
over
immigration
policies
in
the
united
states
has
been
frequent
since
the
1960s
the
immigration
act
of
1965
replaced
the
national
quota
system
which
limited
immigration
to
a
set
amount
from
each
country
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
amendments
of
1976
limited
the
entry
of
professionals
who
usually
circumvented
this
exception
by
applying
under
family
reunification
finally
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
called
for
immigrants
unable
to
achieve
a
legal
status
here
to
return
home
what
was
common
to
all
the
immigration
laws
other
than
the
1965
act
is
that
they
dealt
with
the
concerns
of
their
day
just
as
president
bushs
initiative
does
however
complicating
bushs
immigration
dilemma
is
the
dynamic
created
by
the
north
american
hemispheres
economic
and
trade
policies
both
the
canadian
and
north
american
free
trade
agreements
have
made
it
easier
to
trade
removed
tariffs
and
loosened
border
restrictions
also
the
comparatively
strong
united
states
economy
has
attracted
a
flow
of
labor
and
jobs
through
a
porous
mexican
border
what
is
inescapable
is
that
as
baby
boomers
age
and
retire
new
workers
must
be
found
to
continue
americas
economic
growth
and
provide
taxes
to
fund
the
very
government
programs
that
the
retirees
will
rely
on
only
through
legal
integration
into
the
american
society
and
economy
will
assimilation
begin
and
a
new
workforce
developed
bushs
idea
is
a
step
in
that
direction
