cited
what

he

theres
a
need
for
a
temporaryguestworker
program

actually
works

dont
support
a
special
pathway
to
citizenship

any

reforms
should
recognize
that
the

must
remain
a
beacon
of
hope
for
the
world
and
a
place
where
people
want
to
come
to
live

that
should
be
balanced
with
the
principle
that
we
are
a
nation
of
laws

has
previously
said
that
hed
support
legislation
that
ensures
