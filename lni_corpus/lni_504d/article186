fallout
can
senate
take
up
immigration
reform
from
scratch
arizonas
controversial
illegal
immigration
bill
has
put
pressure
on
congress
to
pass
immigration
reform
but
is
the
senate
leaders
vow
to
take
up
the
issue
too
panicked

the
signing
into
law
of
arizonas
controversial
illegal
immigration
bill
has
apparently
altered
the
course
of
congress
three
senators
were
expecting
to
introduce
a
landmark
energy
bill
to
reduce
greenhouse
gases
and
combat
global
warming
monday
now
with
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
taking
up
president
obamas
call
for
urgent
immigration
reform
saying
it
is
his
top
priority
the
coalition
for
the
climatechange
bill
is
falling
apart
can
the
senate
in
the
space
of
a
single
weekend
actually
let
immigration
reform
cut
to
the
front
of
the
legislative
line
no
said
sen
lindsey
graham
r
of
south
carolina
who
pulled
his
support
for
the
energy
bill
in
protest
against
senator
reids
intentions
his
reason
passing
major
legislation
is
a
long
messy
slog
as
heathcare
reform
showed
and
congress
has
done
virtually
no
spadework
to
prepare
the
legislative
ground
for
an
illegal
immigration
bill
i
know
from
my
own
personal
experience
the
tremendous
amounts
of
time
energy
and
effort
that
must
be
devoted
to
this
issue
to
make
even
limited
progress
he
said
legislative
efforts
of
the
past
year
suggest
that
there
is
some
truth
in
his
statement
thirteen
months
of
spadeworktake
financial
reform
for
example
on
monday
the
senate
is
set
to
vote
on
a
bill
but
the
process
of
preparing
it
began
13
months
ago
on
march
26
2009
treasury
secretary
timothy
geithner
was
testifying
before
congress
about
the
broad
outlines
for
financial
reform
by
midjune
president
obama
had
laid
out
a
fiveprong
plan
and
in
september
still
seven
months
ago
mr
obama
was
telling
wall
street
that
the
days
of
reckless
greed
were
over
yet
only
now
has
the
bill
been
deemed
ready
for
the
light
of
a
vote
and
immigration
reform
is
likely
to
be
harder
immigration
is
probably
the
most
hotly
divided
issue
in
the
senate
said
thomas
friedman
author
of
hot
flat
and
crowded
on
cbss
face
the
nation
the
energy
bill
itself
shows
the
difficulty
of
getting
major
legislation
through
the
senate
senator
graham
has
been
working
with
sens
john
kerry
d
of
massachusetts
and
joseph
lieberman
i
of
connecticut
for
months
to
try
to
craft
a
bipartisan
bill
but
before
bowing
out
this
weekend
graham
remained
the
only
republican
to
back
it
either
none
or
very
little
of
the
backroom
wrangling
needed
to
shape
immigration
reform
into
a
workable
bill
has
begun
while
the
energy
bill
was
essentially
ready
to
go
graham
said
immigration
reform
harder
than
last
timein
a
signal
of
how
difficult
passage
of
an
immigration
reform
bill
might
be
the
primary
republican
supporter
of
the
2007
bid
for
federal
immigration
reform
sen
john
mccain
of
arizona
backed
the
arizona
law
signed
by
gov
jan
brewer
last
week
he
is
currently
locked
in
a
tight
primary
race
and
70
percent
of
arizona
voters
approve
of
the
law
according
to
rasmussen
reports
the
law
requires
people
in
arizona
suspected
of
being
illegal
immigrants
to
show
proof
of
legal
residence
when
asked
by
law
enforcement
critics
have
called
it
a
vehicle
for
potential
racial
profiling
supporters
have
said
the
state
needed
to
do
something
to
try
to
stem
rampant
illegal
immigration
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
went
so
far
as
to
say
at
a
monitorsponsored
breakfast
last
week
that
he
has
questions
about
whether
the
senate
can
pass
immigration
reform
and
that
the
house
will
not
take
up
the
issue
until
the
senate
proves
it
can
make
headway
i
am
not
sure
the
senate
can
move
an
immigration
bill
he
said
senator
reid
indicates
he
wants
to
try
to
move
an
immigration
bill
if
he
can
move
an
immigration
bill
the
position
the
speaker
and
i
have
taken
is
we
will
address
that
matter
graham
has
questioned
reids
motives
for
prioritizing
illegal
immigration
with
reid
in
danger
of
losing
his
seat
this
fall
some
critics
have
suggested
that
the
nevada
senators
move
is
an
attempt
to
court
nevadas
hispanics
who
make
up
26
percent
of
the
state
population
said
graham
moving
forward
on
immigration
in
this
hurried
panicked
manner
is
nothing
more
than
a
cynical
political
ploy
