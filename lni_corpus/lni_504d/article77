compromise
as
the
state
of
arizona
wrangled
with
the
justice
department
in
2010
about
its
authority
to
help
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
new
house
republican
majority
sided
with
arizonas
governor
the
republicans
said
they
would
reaffirm
the
authority
of
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
all
federal
immigration
laws
that
was
before
the
us
supreme
court
invalidated
most
parts
of
the
law
in
june
2012
house
lawmakers
took
action
some
of
their
most
recent
moves
in
march
2012
they
held
hearings
on
hr
3808
the
scott
gardner
act
which
would
have
empowered
state
and
local
law
enforcement
pulling
over
drunk
drivers
to
check
immigration
status
and
hold
in
custody
unlawfully
present
aliens
the
measure
didnt
make
it
to
the
house
floor
in
may
2012
they
amended
an
appropriations
bill
to
try
to
stop
the
federal
challenge
to
arizonas
law
it
prohibited
funding
for
the
attorney
general
to
challenge
state
immigration
enforcement
laws
not
just
in
arizona
but
also
in
oklahoma
missouri
utah
indiana
alabama
south
carolina
and
georgia
the
bill
died
in
the
senate
in
june
2012
they
amended
a
different
appropriations
bill
this
time
to
protect
a
program
that
deputizes
some
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
to
help
with
immigration
enforcement
it
prohibited
funding
from
being
used
to
terminate
the
program
known
as
287g
that
bill
also
died
in
the
senate
while
those
efforts
to
reaffirm
the
authority
of
state
and
local
law
enforcement
failed
congress
continues
to
fund
some
programs
that
enlist
state
and
local
help
they
come
in
two
forms
in
the
first
type
some
state
and
local
officials
are
deputized
to
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
thats
the
case
with
the
controversial
287g
partnerships
between
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
and
local
agencies
critics
argue
they
encourage
racial
profiling
and
discourage
immigrants
from
reporting
crime
congress
funded
them
through
continuing
appropriations
said
chris
rickerd
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
though
the
obama
administration
is
winding
down
the
most
contentious
task
force
partnerships
then
there
are
programs
that
enlist
state
and
local
help
arguably
without
ceding
any
real
authority
those
include
the
secure
communities
program
under
which
fingerprints
taken
by
local
jurisdictions
are
shared
with
federal
officials
to
be
checked
against
immigration
databases
operation
stonegarden
a
grant
program
to
reimburse
local
law
enforcement
agencies
for
work
along
border
areas
and
the
state
criminal
alien
assistance
program
which
reimburses
some
local
corrections
systems
for
detaining
people
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
those
are
examples
of
congressional
support
for
local
and
state
law
enforcement
assistance
said
jessica
vaughan
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
advocates
for
low
levels
of
immigration
but
rickerd
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
which
opposed
the
arizona
law
and
287g
argues
that
since
decisions
about
enforcement
remain
with
federal
agencies
the
programs
dont
necessarily
reaffirm
any
authority
on
the
part
of
local
officials
house
republicans
in
the
112th
congress
promised
to
reaffirm
the
authority
of
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
all
federal
immigration
laws
lawmakers
made
a
series
of
attempts
to
do
that
but
efforts
stalled
or
were
rebuffed
by
the
senate
still
congress
did
reauthorize
funding
for
several
programs
that
enlist
state
and
local
participation
in
federal
immigration
enforcement
we
rate
this
promise
a
compromise
