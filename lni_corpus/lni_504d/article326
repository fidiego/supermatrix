immigration
has
had
more
impact
on
the
face
of
america
than
any
other
social
political
or
economic
influence
but
the
history
of
united
states
immigration
policy
can
best
be
described
in
one
word
schizophrenic
immigrants
from
around
the
world
seeking
political
freedom
and
economic
stability
in
the
united
states
have
been
welcomed
recruited
and
embraced
some
have
become
corporate
leaders
a
few
have
been
elected
to
high
office
others
have
been
ostracized
condemned
targeted
for
arrest
and
even
killed
and
while
the
american
public
consistently
has
called
on
the
countrys
elected
officials
to
enact
stricter
immigration
controls
republicans
and
democrats
on
capitol
hill
and
in
the
white
house
have
sought
to
broaden
americas
immigrant
base
through
new
laws
along
with
various
amnesty
and
guestworker
programs
for
illegal
aliens
already
in
the
country
on
wednesday
president
bush
proposed
a
new
guestworker
program
which
could
see
the
legalization
of
millions
of
the
illegal
aliens
now
in
the
united
states
immigration
experts
and
others
said
the
proposal
if
approved
by
congress
and
fully
implemented
would
further
change
the
face
of
america
mr
bushs
proposal
has
enraged
proponents
of
stricter
immigration
enforcement
who
believe
the
federal
government
in
the
wake
of
the
september
11
attacks
should
be
bolstering
security
along
us
borders
and
tracking
down
and
deporting
the
millions
of
illegal
aliens
already
here
they
say
guestworker
and
amnesty
programs
reward
lawbreakers
granting
permanent
status
to
those
who
have
entered
the
country
illegally
while
discriminating
against
those
who
seek
legal
immigration
supporters
of
mr
bushs
plan
say
it
allows
employers
to
hire
the
workers
they
need
gives
illegal
aliens
now
in
the
country
a
chance
to
legalize
their
status
and
will
improve
relations
with
mexico
rep
jeff
flake
who
is
cosponsoring
a
guestworker
bill
with
fellow
arizonan
republicans
sen
john
mccain
and
rep
jim
kolbe
credited
the
president
with
presenting
a
rational
and
realistic
vision
of
immigration
reform
president
bush
has
got
it
right
mr
flake
said
a
comprehensive
temporaryworker
program
will
dramatically
improve
the
situation
at
our
borders
liberalized
immigration
laws
and
guestworker
and
amnesty
programs
continue
to
be
pushed
by
what
immigration
experts
call
the
elites
members
of
congress
top
business
and
labor
union
executives
and
various
religious
leaders
it
has
been
those
socalled
elites
according
to
the
immigration
experts
that
have
had
the
most
immediate
impact
on
the
countrys
vast
immigration
system
beginning
most
prominently
in
1965
when
congress
passed
the
landmark
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
ended
a
national
origins
quota
system
james
w
ziglar
former
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ins
now
an
agency
within
homeland
security
said
the
1965
law
changed
our
immigration
policy
dramatically
opening
the
us
border
to
immigrants
from
asia
and
latin
america
but
the
law
lacked
the
flexibility
we
needed
to
accommodate
our
own
society
mr
ziglar
said
with
mexico
a
labor
source
on
our
border
it
contained
no
quota
difference
for
that
country
than
it
did
for
other
countries
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
he
said
and
if
you
dont
deal
with
a
problem
youre
going
to
end
up
with
a
problem
the
problem
the
new
law
created
mr
ziglar
said
was
increased
illegal
immigration
by
mexican
nationals
and
others
looking
to
follow
relatives
and
friends
who
had
immigrated
legally
to
the
united
states
for
jobs
a
wave
of
humanity
that
continues
today
we
have
8
million
to
12
million
illegal
aliens
in
the
country
today
and
a
government
grappling
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
them
he
said
it
is
an
ongoing
debate
with
no
likely
resolution
as
the
war
on
terrorism
focuses
the
countrys
attention
on
border
security
few
government
policies
can
have
so
profound
an
effect
on
a
nation
as
immigration
said
steven
a
camarota
director
of
research
at
the
districtbased
center
for
immigration
studies
cis
large
numbers
of
immigrants
and
their
descendants
cannot
help
but
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
cultural
political
and
economic
situation
of
their
new
country
but
americas
immigration
policy
is
and
has
been
in
chaos
complete
incoherence
mr
camarota
said
we
have
never
put
up
the
money
it
takes
to
either
run
such
a
system
or
to
guarantee
enforcement
we
have
created
a
very
large
immigration
system
but
not
the
infrastructure
it
takes
to
manage
it
in
any
coherent
way
mr
camarota
noted
that
the
rate
of
increase
in
legal
us
immigration
coupled
with
a
dramatic
rise
in
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
coming
annually
to
the
united
states
does
seem
to
be
without
precedent
in
recent
years
adding
that
efforts
have
to
be
made
to
overhaul
the
system
and
reduce
the
total
numbers
because
legal
immigration
is
so
large
it
has
helped
drive
illegal
immigration
he
said
the
bigger
the
legal
population
the
bigger
the
illegal
population
this
chaos
will
continue
until
you
restore
integrity
to
the
system
bring
the
numbers
down
and
then
decide
in
a
careful
way
what
increases
are
warranted
according
to
the
us
census
bureau
the
countrys
foreignborn
population
in
march
2002
was
325
million
about
115
percent
of
the
total
us
population
522
percent
of
whom
were
born
in
latin
america
this
compares
to
197
million
foreignborn
residents
in
1990
14
million
in
1980
and
95
million
in
1970
according
to
census
bureau
records
in
addition
between
8
million
and
12
million
illegal
aliens
are
believed
to
be
living
in
the
united
states
mostly
mexican
nationals
with
anywhere
from
1
million
to
3
million
more
expected
this
year
according
to
us
border
enforcement
officials
rules
changed
described
at
the
time
as
part
of
a
sweeping
overhaul
of
americas
immigration
system
the
1965
act
eliminated
the
country
of
origin
as
the
basis
for
approving
a
persons
legal
entry
to
the
united
states
changing
americas
immigrant
population
from
one
predominantly
european
nearly
90
percent
to
latin
american
and
asian
which
now
make
up
about
77
percent
beginning
in
the
1820s
and
running
through
1890
a
period
known
as
the
era
of
mass
immigration
immigrants
attracted
by
reports
of
economic
opportunity
and
religious
and
political
freedom
came
to
the
united
states
mainly
from
great
britain
ireland
germany
norway
sweden
and
the
netherlands
between
1890
and
1910
the
vast
majority
of
new
immigrants
were
from
austria
hungary
italy
and
russia
in
1924
the
government
enacted
legislation
that
for
the
first
time
set
limits
on
the
number
of
people
who
could
legally
immigrate
to
the
united
states
from
specific
countries
the
limits
were
based
on
the
number
of
people
from
those
countries
already
living
in
america
mr
camarota
said
the
1965
law
came
on
the
heels
of
the
civil
rights
movement
passed
by
a
congress
concerned
that
existing
us
immigration
laws
discriminated
against
asians
and
hispanics
he
said
the
lawmakers
responded
to
their
new
civil
rights
sensibilities
but
failed
to
anticipate
the
enormous
desire
of
immigrants
to
come
to
america
particularly
those
from
mexico
the
difference
between
the
standard
of
living
in
the
united
states
and
almost
everywhere
else
is
so
vast
that
the
desire
to
come
to
this
country
is
equally
vast
he
said
according
to
a
recent
justice
department
report
of
the
1063732
persons
who
immigrated
legally
in
2002
to
the
united
states
219380
were
from
mexico
71105
from
india
61282
from
china
51308
from
the
philippines
and
33267
from
vietnam
those
five
countries
accounted
for
41
percent
of
the
nations
legal
immigrants
illegal
immigrants
illegal
immigration
according
to
lawenforcement
authorities
and
immigration
experts
continues
to
affect
the
face
of
america
aided
in
part
by
various
guestworker
and
amnesty
programs
authorized
by
both
republican
and
democratic
administrations
over
the
past
20
years
since
1986
congress
has
passed
seven
amnesty
proposals
targeting
more
than
57
million
illegal
aliens
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
said
amnesty
and
guestworker
programs
like
the
one
proposed
last
week
by
mr
bush
encourage
additional
illegal
immigration
mr
stein
also
noted
that
when
legal
migration
numbers
are
high
illegal
immigration
totals
also
increase
he
said
fair
with
70000
members
nationwide
has
sought
enhanced
border
security
an
end
to
illegal
immigration
and
the
establishment
of
legal
immigration
levels
it
believes
are
consistent
with
the
national
interest
about
300000
a
year
as
history
has
proven
conclusively
amnesties
do
not
solve
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
they
encourage
even
more
illegal
immigration
the
message
that
is
disseminated
loudly
and
clearly
throughout
the
world
is
that
its
time
to
start
lining
up
for
the
next
amnesty
program
he
said
once
a
pattern
of
dealing
with
illegal
immigration
through
amnesty
programs
is
established
there
will
be
no
end
to
the
number
of
people
prepared
to
get
in
on
the
deal
he
said
considered
key
among
government
efforts
to
revamp
its
immigration
system
was
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
irca
a
onetimeonly
deal
passed
by
a
republicancontrolled
senate
a
democraticcontrolled
house
and
approved
by
president
reagan
as
part
of
a
compromise
package
between
those
who
wanted
to
reduce
illegal
immigration
and
others
who
wanted
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
by
granting
legal
residency
to
illegal
aliens
already
in
the
country
irca
also
mandated
employer
sanctions
or
fines
for
those
who
knowingly
hired
illegal
aliens
the
sanctions
still
on
the
books
rarely
have
been
enforced
but
the
1986
law
resulted
in
amnesty
for
27
million
illegal
aliens
mostly
mexican
nationals
who
had
lived
and
worked
in
the
united
states
for
anywhere
from
90
days
for
agricultural
workers
to
a
year
for
others
in
addition
it
also
granted
legal
residency
to
160000
spouses
and
children
of
those
aliens
lawenforcement
authorities
and
immigration
experts
said
the
act
also
increased
illegal
immigration
as
others
sought
to
find
a
way
into
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
the
plan
many
through
the
use
of
easily
attainable
fraudulent
documents
according
to
a
study
by
the
center
for
immigration
studies
the
total
net
cost
of
the
irca
amnesty
the
direct
and
indirect
costs
of
services
and
benefits
to
the
formerly
illegal
aliens
minus
their
tax
contributions
after
10
years
was
more
than

bombing

qaeda
terrorists
was
legalized
as
a
seasonal
agricultural
worker
as
part
of
the
1986
amnesty
law
mr
ziglar
said
it
is
unlikely
the
debate
over
immigration
will
ever
be
resolved
because
us
sentiment
about
the
role
newcomers
play
in
society
will
likely
ebb
and
flow
with
events
and
with
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
us
economy
but
he
believes
the
country
must
first
determine
if
it
is
committed
to
its
heritage
as
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
as
a
refuge
for
those
escaping
oppression
and
seeking
opportunity
or
if
such
a
commitment
is
relevant
or
necessary
in
todays
america
he
said
questions
also
need
to
be
addressed
on
how
to
control
the
flow
of
illegal
aliens
across
americas
borders
what
to
do
about
the
8
million
to
12
million
illegal
aliens
in
the
country
and
whether
granting
them
amnesty
was
a
reward
for
breaking
the
law
and
while
continuing
to
address
the
threat
of
terrorism
mr
ziglar
also
said
congress
and
the
white
house
must
decide
how
the
united
states
protects
the
civil
liberties
of
its
citizens
and
noncitizens
while
securing
them
from
the
threat
of
a
terrorist
attack
what
we
are
witnessing
today
regarding
immigration
policy
is
not
new
there
is
no
issue
today
that
hasnt
been
debated
throughout
history
he
said
in
good
times
we
oversee
a
fairly
easy
immigration
policy
in
tougher
times
immigration
becomes
an
issue
and
a
problem
it
is
however
one
of
the
most
important
issues
this
country
must
address
and
