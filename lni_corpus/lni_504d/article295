its
2006
and
time
for
the
decennial
immigration
reform
as
in
1986
and
1996
congress
is
again
pondering
comprehensive
amendments
to
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
the
most
recent
proposal
is
sen
arlen
specters
compendium
of
other
bills
that
promises
increased
enforcement
while
granting
legalization
to
perhaps
9
million
illegal
aliens
already
here
if
a
new
immigration
law
is
enacted
this
year
it
probably
will
resemble
specters
bill
the
specter
bill
would
have
a
profound
effect
on
immigration
policy
for
a
while
but
will
do
nothing
to
solve
the
immigration
issue
to
see
why
look
at
the
last
time
congress
fixed
immigration
in
1986
i
was
a
veteran
us
immigration
officer
in
philadelphia
congress
perceived
that
there
was
an
immigration
crisis
with
millions
of
foreign
undocumented
workers
jimmy
carters
felicitous
phrase
and
the
border
patrol
capturing
about
200000
illegals
in
1985
the
result
was
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
irca
irca
tried
to
eliminate
the
illegal
alien
problem
by
making
most
of
the
aliens
in
the
country
legal
and
removing
the
incentive
for
others
to
enter
like
the
specter
bill
irca
was
a
carrotandstick
bill
the
carrot
was
permanent
resident
status
for
most
illegal
aliens
who
could
establish
continuous
presence
from
jan
1
1982
they
had
a
year
to
apply
the
stick
was
employer
sanctions
congress
assumed
that
the
opportunity
to
work
drew
most
illegal
aliens
so
irca
put
the
enforcement
burden
on
americas
employers
who
were
required
to
ensure
that
alien
employees
were
authorized
to
work
if
an
alien
could
not
establish
legal
presence
and
permission
to
work
no
employer
would
hire
him
under
penalty
of
sanctions
a
50
fine
and
the
illegal
alien
rebuffed
at
every
turn
would
go
home
or
so
congress
reasoned
this
seemed
just
as
idiotic
to
those
of
us
in
immigration
enforcement
then
as
it
sounds
now
to
promote
employer
compliance
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ordered
its
force
of
special
agents
to
curtail
enforcement
work
and
personally
deliver
informational
packets
to
any
business
the
agents
could
find
in
198687
there
were
about
950
immigration
agents
responsible
for
interior
enforcement
in
the
united
states
about
20
in
philadelphia
most
interior
enforcement
virtually
stopped
for
months
while
agents
drove
around
handing
out
i9
forms
this
was
about
the
time
the
crack
cocaine
epidemic
was
starting
fueled
largely
by
jamaican
drug
gangs
yet
calls
to
ins
from
police
prosecutors
and
prisons
reporting
criminal
aliens
were
ignored
while
the
agents
were
busy
on
publicrelations
work
at
the
same
time
adjudications
officers
were
reassigned
to
legalization
offices
and
the
perennial
backlog
of
immigration
petitions
always
a
problem
soared
illicit
border
crossings
and
alien
smuggling
swelled
what
were
the
results
of
irca
by
1990
the
washington
post
reported
that
the
nations
prisons
and
jails
held
125000
criminal
aliens
who
should
have
been
tracked
for
possible
deportation
but
were
unknown
to
the
ins
this
was
a
direct
result
of
diverting
enforcement
resources
to
the
sanctions
publicity
program
by
the
early
1990s
employer
sanctions
was
a
dead
letter
rarely
enforced
by
the
government
and
mostly
ignored
by
the
nations
employers
not
one
american
in
50
today
knows
what
an
i9
form
is
although
the
law
still
requires
those
of
us
who
work
to
complete
them
oh
and
congress
estimates
that
there
are
between
9
and
13
million
illegal
aliens
here
waiting
for
the
next
legalization
law
so
much
for
the
stick
ircas
carrot
the
legalization
program
had
a
happy
ending
for
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
aliens
who
got
green
cards
in
addition
aliens
who
missed
the
oneyear
deadline
even
some
who
had
never
been
in
the
united
states
sued
for
an
extension
and
the
federal
courts
obliged
in
1997
aliens
were
still
litigating
their
right
to
apply
for
amnesty
under
the
1986
law
many
of
those
aliens
entered
the
country
long
after
the
oneyear
deadline
yet
presented
proof
of
their
presence
prior
to
that
if
specters
bill
becomes
law
we
will
do
this
all
over
again
