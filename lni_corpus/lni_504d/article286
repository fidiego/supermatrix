when
sharon
nyantekyi
a
rutgers
university
honors
student
was
taken
into
custody
last
month
for
a
civil
immigration
violation
she
had
no
criminal
history
never
as
much
as
high
school
detention
yet
she
was
shackled
taken
to
the
middlesex
county
adult
correction
center
and
placed
among
the
general
female
inmate
population
were
not
criminals
and
we
were
mixed
in
with
criminals
said
nyantekyi
speaking
of
herself
and
other
female
immigration
detainees
she
met
in
jail
to
be
just
thrown
in
there
was
like
being
thrown
to
the
wolves
nyantekyis
experiences
during
her
21
days
of
detention
opened
a
window
into
a
little
known
aspect
of
the
detention
system
into
which
many
immigration
detainees
are
cast
that
female
detainees
are
routinely
held
among
the
general
inmate
population
at
several
new
jersey
facilities
few
women
have
spoken
in
public
about
the
conditions
of
their
detention
since
most
are
deported
straightaway
from
the
facilities
if
this
was
happening
in
another
country
to
us
citizens
the
us
would
be
leading
the
pack
to
call
it
a
human
rights
violation
nyantekyi
said
the
federal
government
increasingly
relies
on
subcontracted
facilities
like
county
jails
to
house
immigration
detainees
the
number
of
detainees
has
gone
from
just
over
9000
in
1996
when
immigration
laws
were
changed
requiring
the
government
to
hold
immigrants
in
custody
prior
to
deportation
to
more
than
21000
in
detention
today
nationwide
more
than
half
of
all
immigration
detainees
in
the
country
are
now
held
in
non
immigration
facilities
like
county
jails
with
the
government
renting
space
at
perdetainee
day
rates
that
add
up
to
millions
of
dollars
a
year
in
local
revenues
but
not
all
local
jails
that
accept
immigration
detainees
have
the
space
to
keep
them
segregated
from
criminal
inmates
there
is
nothing
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
guidelines
that
requires
them
to
do
so
even
though
those
held
on
immigration
law
violations
are
legally
considered
administrative
not
criminal
detainees
although
new
jersey
county
jails
generally
keep
male
immigration
detainees
segregated
from
their
general
inmate
population
several
jails
said
they
sometimes
house
female
detainees
with
the
general
female
inmate
population
in
our
jail
as
in
any
correctional
environment
there
are
generally
more
males
than
females
so
theres
a
much
smaller
space
allotment
to
house
females
said
ben
feldman
a
spokesman
for
the
bergen
county
sheriffs
department
which
oversees
the
bergen
county
jail
as
a
result
of
that
theres
a
need
to
house
those
two
groups
of
females
ins
and
general
inmate
females
together
at
passaic
county
jail
the
number
of
immigration
detainees
reached
nearly
500
before
passaic
county
sheriff
jerry
speziale
suspended
the
agreement
in
december
2005
prompted
by
protests
from
detainees
and
advocates
over
their
treatment
and
a
federal
government
investigation
into
conditions
at
the
jail
bill
maer
the
sheriffs
spokesman
said
the
last
immigration
detainee
was
transferred
out
of
the
jail
on
april
4
when
the
jail
used
to
house
them
he
said
male
immigration
detainees
were
segregated
from
the
general
inmate
population
but
female
immigration
detainees
were
sometimes
housed
with
criminal
female
us
marshal
inmates
he
emphasized
that
immigration
detainees
were
not
mixed
with
the
general
female
inmates
at
the
middlesex
county
adult
correction
center
where
nyantekyi
was
held
among
criminal
inmates
until
being
transferred
into
protective
custody
after
her
safety
was
threatened
warden
edward
cicchi
acknowledged
in
an
interview
last
week
that
the
jail
sometimes
mixed
female
immigration
detainees
in
with
the
general
population
when
we
have
females
we
dont
have
a
separate
spot
to
put
them
so
theyre
in
with
the
general
population
he
said
but
he
added
that
they
try
not
to
mix
them
unless
they
are
short
on
space
as
a
rule
we
try
to
keep
them
separate
he
said
the
housing
of
female
administrative
immigration
detainees
like
nyantekyi
among
female
criminal
inmates
at
new
jersey
county
jails
is
ultimately
up
to
each
facilitys
discretion
as
long
as
they
conform
with
department
of
homeland
security
guidelines
however
the
guidelines
regarding
the
housing
and
treatment
of
immigration
detainees
hold
no
legal
weight
immigration
advocates
and
those
whove
been
through
detention
like
nyantekyi
say
that
unenforceable
guidelines
can
lead
to
arbitrary
decisions
on
treatment
the
basic
problem
with
the
guidelines
is
that
they
are
just
guidelines
and
are
not
incorporated
into
the
contracts
that
ice
takes
out
with
the
jails
said
bryan
lonegan
a
lawyer
with
the
new
york
based
legal
aid
society
who
works
with
immigration
detainees
throughout
new
jersey
if
were
going
to
detain
people
and
these
are
people
in
violation
of
civil
laws
not
criminal
laws
they
should
be
detained
in
different
kinds
of
facilities
lonegan
said
ice
guidelines
focus
on
classifying
detainees
according
to
their
law
enforcement
history
and
the
potential
threat
they
may
pose
rather
than
segregating
them
along
administrative
versus
criminal
classification
lines
according
to
ice
spokesman
mike
gilhooly
we
require
that
facilities
where
we
place
detainees
meet
the
standards
regarding
classification
he
said
we
require
that
detainees
be
held
with
other
general
population
people
with
the
same
classification
but
nyantekyi
23
who
had
no
criminal
history
and
was
facing
deportation
because
she
was
brought
to
this
country
from
ghana
as
a
child
by
a
relative
with
false
papers
said
she
wasnt
the
only
noncriminal
detainee
mixed
in
with
other
female
criminal
inmates
what
happened
to
me
is
not
the
exception
its
the
rule
she
said
right
now
at
this
moment
in
middlesex
or
bergen
there
are
women
suffering
what
