washington
while
house
and
senate
republicans
made
illegal
immigration
their
top
priority
before
hitting
the
campaign
trail
this
month
a
new
pew
research
center
poll
finds
that
most
americans
wont
be
focusing
on
immigration
come
nov
7
just
24
percent
of
voters
name
immigration
as
a
key
election
issue
compared
with
51
percent
who
cite
iraq
and
37
percent
who
cite
terrorism
according
to
the
poll
beyond
borders
view
our
special
section
on
immigration
it
matters
a
great
deal
to
a
small
minority
of
voters
but
it
is
not
a
toptier
issue
for
a
majority
of
voters
said
pews
associate
director
carroll
doherty
with
the
scandal
surrounding
former
congressman
mark
foley
dominating
the
national
political
discussion
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
impact
immigration
or
for
that
matter
any
other
issue
will
have
on
voters
but
the
pew
poll
released
late
last
week
suggests
that
the
foley
scandal
has
not
significantly
affected
voters
views
democrats
according
to
the
telephone
survey
of
1804
adults
maintained
a
slight
advantage
over
republicans
both
before
and
after
the
former
florida
congressman
resigned
in
the
wake
of
disclosed
sexual
emails
between
himself
and
teenage
pages
concern
about
immigration
was
higher
among
republicans
32
percent
of
whom
identified
it
as
a
top
voting
issue
compared
with
12
percent
of
democrats
the
poll
also
noted
doherty
said
that
those
who
favor
a
tough
approach
to
immigration
are
much
more
motivated
than
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue
fully
33
percent
of
those
who
back
strong
border
protection
and
stiffer
penalties
say
immigration
is
important
to
their
vote
that
compares
with
just
11
percent
of
those
who
support
a
comprehensive
approach
to
immigration
policy
the
poll
found
the
numbers
havent
stopped
candidates
in
battleground
states
from
arizona
to
pennsylvania
from
running
on
toughonimmigration
platforms
tamar
jacoby
a
senior
fellow
at
the
manhattan
institute
who
advocates
in
favor
of
legalization
for
undocumented
aliens
said
she
doubts
immigration
will
become
the
central
voting
issue
even
in
those
states
elections
dont
turn
on
immigration
a
lot
of
candidates
think
they
might
but
they
havent
yet
jacoby
said
john
keehey
spokesman
for
the
center
for
immigration
studies
in
washington
dc
which
favors
tough
policies
on
illegal
immigrants
and
restrictions
on
legal
immigration
said
his
own
group
has
found
that
widespread
concern
about
immigration
will
translate
directly
into
votes
on
election
day
its
pretty
clear
that
the
intensity
of
interest
on
this
issue
is
in
no
way
regionally
contained
he
said
but
he
acknowledged
immigration
could
get
overwhelmed
by
the
foley
scandal
its
drowning
out
really
all
policy
discussions
you
cant
have
anything
as
long
as
this
foley
thing
is
going
on
locally
bordercontrol
activists
and
others
who
count
themselves
as
deeply
concerned
about
illegal
immigration
said
they
still
count
it
as
a
top
voting
issue
kenneth
grissom
of
la
crescenta
who
described
himself
as
a
registered
republican
said
he
is
frustrated
with
his
party
on
immigration
republicans
are
not
taking
charge
theyre
not
taking
advantage
of
their
majority
he
said
gop
leaders
last
month
failed
to
enact
broad
measures
they
sought
to
make
it
easier
to
deport
illegal
immigrants
and
give
legal
immigrants
fewer
avenues
for
appeal
when
facing
deportation
they
did
however
approve
a
700mile
fence
between
the
us
and
mexico
which
grissom
called
a
good
start
robin
hvidston
of
upland
a
national
coordinator
for
the
minuteman
civil
border
patrol
group
said
she
counts
the
absence
of
a
new
guestworker
program
or
legalization
measures
as
a
victory
for
her
side
senate
republicans
and
democrats
also
failed
this
year
to
enact
their
legislation
which
would
have
beefed
up
border
security
while
also
creating
a
guestworker
program
as
well
as
granting
citizenship
to
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
it
seems
like
what
weve
mainly
been
able
to
accomplish
is
keeping
the
status
quo
hvidston
said
hvidston
said
she
doesnt
believe
the
foley
scandal
will
influence
votes
for
those
who
care
about
immigration
to
the
person
in
the
voting
booth
in
an
area
affected
by
illegal
immigration
the
foley
scandal
as
harmful
as
it
is
may
fall
to
the
wayside
when
you
get
in
the
booth
to
vote
for
your
man
the
local
issues
may
be
more
important
than
the
foley
scandal
