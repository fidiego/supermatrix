immigration
officials
will
automatically
be
notified
any
time
the
local
or
state
police
do
a
federal
fingerprint
check
on
a
suspect
who
also
happens
to
be
wanted
for
serious
immigration
violations
under
a
new
system
being
tested
in
boston
the
automated
notification
is
part
of
a
department
of
homeland
security
program
that
could
expand
the
role
that
the
local
and
state
police
nationwide
play
in
the
immigration
enforcement
effort
to
federal
officials
it
is
a
natural
next
step
as
police
forces
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
officers
who
routinely
come
into
contact
with
illegal
immigrants
while
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
has
a
squad
of
only
about
6000
criminal
investigators
we
are
giving
more
information
to
more
people
who
can
act
on
the
information
said
robert
a
mocny
acting
director
of
usvisit
the
department
of
homeland
security
program
coordinating
the
effort
it
only
makes
sense
but
some
immigration
and
civil
liberties
advocates
objected
once
the
police
become
viewed
as
immigration
agents
as
opposed
to
simply
safety
and
law
enforcement
patrols
they
will
lose
the
cooperation
and
trust
of
a
significant
portion
of
the
communities
they
serve
said
marshall
fitz
director
of
advocacy
at
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
that
ultimately
undermines
all
of
our
security
interest
barry
steinhardt
director
of
the
technology
and
liberty
program
at
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
he
was
also
concerned
the
homeland
security
departments
records
rely
upon
just
two
fingerprints
instead
of
10
and
are
therefore
more
subject
to
error
mr
steinhardt
said
which
could
result
in
someones
being
wrongly
detained
on
immigration
charges
it
is
an
unreliable
system
being
run
by
a
barely
competent
agency
mr
steinhardt
said
the
new
program
has
started
in
a
relatively
modest
way
when
the
boston
police
department
runs
a
fingerprint
check
of
federal
criminal
records
for
crime
suspects
it
will
also
check
a
homeland
security
department
database
of
420000
people
who
have
violated
immigration
laws
the
federal
list
includes
people
who
have
been
previously
deported
from
the
united
states
or
tried
to
enter
but
were
denied
visas
if
the
police
happen
to
stop
one
of
those
people
both
the
boston
police
department
and
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
a
division
of
the
homeland
security
department
will
be
notified
the
department
may
then
ask
the
boston
police
to
hold
the
person
for
up
to
48
hours
until
the
federal
authorities
can
take
him
into
custody
or
otherwise
begin
deportation
proceedings
an
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
spokesman
said
eventually
as
more
cities
and
states
participate
the
homeland
security
department
intends
to
add
nine
million
sets
of
fingerprints
to
the
database
to
include
people
with
less
serious
immigration
records
like
someone
caught
trying
to
cross
the
border
from
mexico
who
then
voluntarily
returned
home
mr
mocny
said
the
local
and
state
police
in
many
cities
including
boston
already
routinely
contact
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
to
see
if
suspects
they
have
detained
might
also
be
wanted
on
federal
immigration
violations
federal
criminal
databases
already
include
some
people
wanted
on
felony
immigration
violations
but
the
immigrationrelated
inquiries
have
previously
been
based
on
names
and
dates
of
birth
which
may
be
forged
and
the
checks
are
not
frequently
done
for
every
arrest
and
fingerprint
check
as
is
now
the
case
in
boston
you
cant
hide
from
the
fingerprint
mr
mocny
said
mr
fitz
of
the
immigration
lawyers
group
said
he
had
no
objection
if
the
fingerprints
were
checked
for
immigration
violations
only
after
an
individual
had
been
charged
with
another
crime
his
concern
he
said
is
that
the
local
police
might
begin
to
submit
such
requests
routinely
during
traffic
stops
or
patrols
simply
to
determine
if
someone
was
in
the
united
states
legally
william
m
casey
deputy
superintendent
of
the
boston
police
said
boston
did
not
plan
to
take
such
a
step
we
are
doing
nothing
differently
than
we
were
doing
before
last
sunday
mr
casey
said
we
are
enforcing
the
laws
the
boston
police
always
enforce
mr
mocny
said
the
homeland
security
department
was
already
moving
to
a
10fingerprint
system
to
address
the
potential
for
fingerprint
mismatches
he
added
that
he
understood
that
this
new
program
might
provoke
debate
it
is
also
unclear
how
much
demand
it
will
place
on
the
federal
immigration
enforcement
authorities
in
detaining
illegal
immigrants
and
conducting
deportation
proceedings
that
is
why
the
project
is
being
tested
in
boston
before
being
expanded
nationally
over
the
next
two
years
eventually
mr
mocny
said
it
will
be
all
violators
of
all
immigration
laws
but
we
are
going
to
give
this
22
months
to
cook
to
make
sure
that
we
are
getting
it
right
