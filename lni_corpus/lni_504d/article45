and

legal
immigration
and
the
economic
impacts
of
reform
the
historical
importance
of
immigration
in
our
country
cannot
be
diminished
noted
former
secretary
of
state
condoleezza
rice
as
members
of
congress
are
home
in
their
districts
meeting
with
constituents
it
is
important
to
recognize
the
many
areas
in
the
immigration
reform
debate
where
consensus
already
exists
the
recommendations
we
are
releasing
today
will
help
move
the
immigration
reform
conversation
forward
to
control
the
flow
of
unauthorized
immigration
bolster
national
security
and
address
the
problem
of
individuals
overstaying
their
visas
the
task
force
recommends
that
a
new
set
of
bordersecurity
metrics
be
established
and
reviewed
by
an
independent
commission
this
system
would
provide
a
muchneeded
picture
of
the
flow
of
unauthorized
immigration
and
allow
the
public
to
hold
accountable
those
responsible
for
securing
the
nations
borders
preventing
unauthorized
immigration
requires
smart
investments
and
that
means
focusing
on
more
than
just
the
southern
border
said
former
secretary
of
homeland
security
michael
chertoff
a
member
of
bpcs
task
force
a
successful
security
strategy
has
to
include
enforcing
laws
within
the
country
including
mandatory
employment
verification
we
must
also
have
the
ability
to
measure
this
success
through
trusted
verifiable
and
independent
metrics
when
addressing
legalization
and
citizenship
the
task
force
proposes
that
any
undocumented
individual
who
pays
all
penalties
passes
a
criminal
background
check
and
fully
complies
with
the
requirements
of
a
legalization
program
should
have
the
ability
to
apply
for
citizenship
however
with
the
exception
of
individuals
brought
here
as
children
priority
must
first
be
given
to
immigrants
who
apply
for
visas
through
legal
channels
before
any
unauthorized
immigrant
is
allowed
to
apply
for
a
green
card
congress
may
also
want
to
consider
accelerating
the
process
for
individuals
who
commit
to
and
fulfill
a
period
of
continued
service
in
the
agricultural
sector
and
should
allow
newly
legalized
immigrants
to
stay
and
renew
interim
status
if
they
prefer
instead
of
automatically
applying
for
a
green
card
reforms
to
our
immigration
laws
must
protect
us
workers
and
grow
our
economy
said
former
secretary
of
labor
hilda
solis
member
of
the
task
force
employmentbased
immigration
levels
should
fluctuate
based
on
labor
needs
and
our
nations
economic
strength
new
workers
should
be
directed
toward
occupations
with
labor
shortages
and
employers
must
be
subject
to
stricter
penalties
if
they
choose
to
continue
to
exploit
and
hire
unauthorized
immigrants
all
employers
small
and
large
alike
must
play
by
the
rules
of
the
game
the
task
force
believes
economic
immigration
is
a
way
to
grow
the
us
economy
and
prevent
unauthorized
immigration
but
it
should
not
take
place
at
the
expense
of
family
and
immediaterelative
immigration
temporary
worker
programs
need
to
strike
the
right
balance
between
being
simple
enough
for
employers
especially
small
businesses
to
use
and
ensuring
that
employers
do
not
exploit
immigrant
workers
or
displace
american
workers
a
steady
flow
of
legal
immigrants
has
many
benefits
it
strengthens
the
us
housing
market
increases
tax
revenues
contributes
to
the
financial
stability
of
our
entitlement
programs
and
supports
entrepreneurship
especially
for
small
businesses
said
former
congressman
john
shadegg
a
member
of
bpcs
task
force
allowing
small
businesses
to
hire
and
recruit
temporary
immigrant
workers
through
simplified
procedures
will
help
these
businesses
secure
the
workers
they
need
lawfully
