as
the
peak
summer
season
approaches
many
international
travelers
passing
through
kennedy
international
airport
at
busy
weekend
arrival
times
are
enduring
long
delays
clearing
immigration
because
of
strict
new
inspection
policies
the
waits
stem
from
the
immigration
services
decision
to
reinstitute
its
screening
of
united
states
citizens
until
january
they
had
been
allowed
to
bypass
immigration
and
move
directly
to
customs
now
american
citizens
arriving
at
kennedy
wait
an
average
of
20
to
30
minutes
to
clear
immigration
airport
officials
say
largely
because
of
more
exacting
screening
foreigners
wait
about
twice
as
long
and
on
weekend
afternoons
when
arrivals
peak
the
waits
are
often
more
than
doubled
ron
wexler
a
qualitycontrol
analyst
for
an
electronics
company
travels
between
new
york
and
rome
at
least
once
a
month
although
he
spent
only
about
10
minutes
in
line
in
the
immigration
hall
at
the
international
arrivals
building
yesterday
afternoon
he
said
that
on
his
last
two
trips
he
spent
about
40
minutes
waiting
i
dont
think
this
is
a
good
policy
because
it
takes
much
longer
and
most
of
the
waiting
is
just
standing
around
in
line
he
said
it
doesnt
take
long
for
them
to
look
at
your
passport
once
you
get
up
there
warning
of
even
longer
delays
with
the
arrival
of
summer
customs
and
airport
officials
are
demanding
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
abandon
screening
every
passengers
passport
until
the
service
can
install
computer
technology
to
clear
arriving
travelers
en
route
faster
system
starts
next
week
we
are
anticipating
a
disaster
situation
with
people
waiting
out
on
planes
because
the
immigration
area
is
so
congested
said
david
z
plavin
director
of
aviation
for
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
which
operates
kennedy
the
problems
have
not
been
confined
to
kennedy
immigration
officials
began
tougher
screening
at
other
international
gates
in
1989
and
long
waits
have
been
reported
in
los
angeles
honolulu
and
other
cities
on
thursday
in
the
face
of
criticism
across
the
nation
the
immigration
service
said
it
was
taking
steps
to
ease
the
crush
starting
next
week
the
immigration
authorities
at
international
airports
will
be
allowed
to
use
a
faster
modified
examination
process
during
heavy
arrival
times
said
verne
jervis
a
spokesman
for
the
service
instead
of
clearing
every
arriving
united
states
citizens
name
through
a
computer
inspectors
will
make
selective
checks
like
checking
only
the
names
of
family
heads
or
every
fourth
person
mr
jervis
said
the
specifics
will
be
left
to
the
port
directors
but
port
authority
officials
say
they
are
skeptical
that
the
change
will
insure
that
all
passengers
clear
all
checks
within
45
minutes
as
recommended
by
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
if
this
does
that
well
support
it
said
armando
arrastia
a
spokesman
for
the
port
authority
the
mathematics
of
the
problem
are
simple
many
more
passports
are
being
examined
by
the
same
number
of
inspectors
at
kennedy
half
of
the
52
immigration
booths
are
now
devoted
solely
to
inspecting
the
passports
of
american
citizens
and
passengers
often
must
wait
outside
in
the
corridors
before
they
can
wait
in
the
immigration
line
itself
as
long
as
52
minutes
on
one
unseasonably
warm
day
in
early
april
with
the
airconditioning
system
not
yet
operative
we
held
passengers
from
10
flights
for
as
long
as
52
minutes
in
the
corridors
mr
plavin
told
members
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
during
a
hearing
last
month
the
immigration
service
says
it
began
the
stricter
screenings
because
the
customs
service
was
not
thorough
enough
in
checking
united
states
citizens
its
inspectors
were
looking
only
selectively
at
passports
instead
of
checking
each
when
we
started
surveying
people
to
find
out
what
citizens
were
being
inspected
we
found
that
only
10
percent
were
being
checked
by
customs
said
duke
austin
a
spokesman
for
the
immigration
service
customs
said
they
couldnt
do
100
percent
but
the
law
requires
that
all
persons
entering
the
country
be
checked
the
customs
service
which
checks
for
drugs
and
other
illegal
imports
and
collects
duties
on
goods
bought
abroad
insists
that
its
selective
screening
works
both
for
detecting
contraband
and
people
without
legitimate
passports
70
percent
more
cocaine
the
screening
identifies
potential
drug
smugglers
terrorists
and
other
criminals
based
on
certain
indicators
like
whether
the
reasons
for
a
passengers
visit
match
its
duration
michael
lovejoy
the
services
program
manager
for
airsea
passenger
operations
said
that
using
this
system
the
customs
service
confiscated
70
percent
more
cocaine
and
40
percent
more
heroin
in
1990
than
in
1989
port
authority
officials
described
the
squabbling
between
immigration
and
customs
as
fingerpointing
that
obscured
immigrations
failure
to
hire
a
full
contingent
of
inspectors
to
meet
its
increased
requirements
kennedy
rarely
has
its
full
contingent
of
342
inspectors
because
immigration
officials
have
said
the
agency
lacks
the
money
but
even
though
a
5
fee
levied
on
passengers
entering
the
country
was
extended
last
year
to
travelers
from
mexico
the
caribbean
and
canada
to
finance
more
inspectors
68
positions
were
vacant
yesterday
the
immigration
service
said
it
planned
to
add
32
more
inspectors
on
monday
technology
to
the
rescue
airport
officials
expect
technology
to
solve
the
problem
eventually
some
airlines
already
use
a
system
on
flights
from
japan
and
europe
called
the
advanced
passenger
information
program
it
electronically
transfers
data
on
arriving
passengers
to
the
immigration
service
while
the
passengers
are
en
route
immigration
officials
run
the
information
through
computers
so
that
when
passengers
land
they
have
already
cleared
inspection
at
kennedy
yesterday
the
stream
of
american
citizens
moved
fairly
steadily
but
the
line
for
foreign
citizens
moved
much
more
slowly
and
foreigners
arriving
on
two
jumbo
jets
around
3
pm
filled
the
international
side
of
the
inspection
hall
foreign
passengers
however
seemed
much
less
agitated
by
the
long
lines
than
their
american
counterparts
in
italia
its
the
same
thing
the
waiting
said
giussino
dalessandro
who
arrived
on
an
alitalia
flight
from
rome
forty
minutes
45
minutes
is
not
such
a
long
time
said
giovanni
scorpati
who
had
arrived
on
the
same
flight
they
spent
about
35
minutes
in
line
before
proceeding
to
