bill
mccollum
on
sunday
may
16th
2010
in
interviews
with
florida
media
the
ruling
fullflop
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
has
proven
problematic
for
florida
republicans
who
in
large
part
appear
wary
of
fully
endorsing
a
proposal
thats
supported
by
a
majority
of
floridians
but
one
that
also
could
cost
votes
among
floridas
hispanic
population
the
tightropewalking
act
is
perhaps
no
more
apparent
than
when
it
comes
to
attorney
general
bill
mccollum
a
republican
running
for
governor
mccollums
primary
opponent
rick
scott
unabashedly
supports
the
law
which
will
require
local
law
enforcement
officials
once
police
stop
a
person
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
those
they
reasonably
suspect
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
the
law
is
also
supported
by
a
58
percent
of
floridians
according

poll
we
decided
to
rate
mccollums
statements
on
the
arizona
law
using
our
flipometer
which
measures
how
consistent
someone
has
been
when
taking
a
position
on
an
issue
before
we
get
to
that
though
we
need
to
give
you
a
quick
history
of
how
the
arizona
law
came
to
pass
the
bill
in
question
originally
was
signed
into
law
on
april
23
2010
by
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
an
amended
version
of
the
bill
one
to
lessen
the
prospects
that
racial
profiling
could
occur
passed
and
was
signed
into
law
on
april
30
the
new
version
of
the
law
says
a
law
enforcement
official
or
agency
of
this
state
or
a
county
city
town
or
other
political
subdivision
of
this
state
may
not
consider
race
color
or
national
origin
in
implementing
the
requirements
of
this
subsection
except
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
united
states
or
arizona
constitution
the
prior
version
had
said
that
an
official
may
not
solely
consider
race
in
such
circumstances
the
change
in
the
bill
though
its
impact
can
be
debated
is
important
to
note
when
discussing
mccollums
position
since
his
first
comments
refer
to
the
first
version
of
the
bill
while
later
comments
refer
to
the
second
version
mccollums
first
published
comments
about
the
arizona
law
came
on
april
27
after
the
original
bill
had
passed
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
like
a
florida
version
of
arizonas
law
i
think
arizona
has
its
own
unique
problems
mccollum
said
i
dont
think
florida
should
enact
laws
like
this
quite
that
far
out
then
in
stories
on
may
13
and
may
14
after
the
amended
version
of
arizonas
law
passed
mccollum
aboutfaced
and
said
he
would
support
a
florida
version
as
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officials
in
arizona
begin
to
implement
the
states
aggressive
new
border
security
law
to
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
i
applaud
gov
brewer
and
the
arizona
legislature
for
stepping
up
their
enforcement
efforts
at
a
time
when
president
obamas
administration
has
let
states
down
mccollum
said
i
support
arizonas
law
as
amended
and
if
the
federal
government
fails
to
secure
our
borders
and
solve
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
i
would
support
a
similar
law
for
florida
and
he
also
said
arizona
leaders
recently
made
needed
changes
that
address
concerns
i
had
that
the
law
could
be
abused
and
misused
to
perform
racially
profiled
stops
and
arrests
i
do
not
support
any
measure
that
would
result
in
racial
profiling
or
other
unintended
consequences
for
lawabiding
american
citizens
then
on
may
16
came
another
comment
to
a
television
reporter
in
port
st
lucie
this
time
mccollum
said
he
didnt
think
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
was
needed
in
florida
i
didnt
change
my
position
but
arizona
changed
its
law
after
they
passed
a
law
that
was
very
bad
and
that
had
that
the
potential
for
racial
profiling
mccollum
said
he
was
then
asked
if
it
was
realistic
that
a
similar
law
might
be
passed
in
florida
we
dont
need
that
law
in
florida
he
said
thats
not
whats
going
to
happen
here
mccollums
most
recent
comments
were
picked
up
on
by
the
scott
campaign
which
highlighted
the
quote
in
a
television
ad
mccollum
called
the
original
version
of
the
arizona
immigration
law
far
out
but
then
said
he
would
support
the
amended
law
being
adopted
in
florida
since
theres
a
debate
over
how
much
difference
the
amendment
ultimately
will
have
in
how
the
law
is
enforced
its
hard
for
us
to
properly
measure
whether
mccollums
position
shift
in
this
instance
is
a
complete
flipflop
but
what
does
strike
us
are
mccollums
comments
on
may
13
and
may
16
both
in
reference
to
the
amended
version
on
may
13
mccollum
said
he
would
support
implementing
the
arizona
law
in
florida
then
on
may
16
he
said
florida
doesnt
need
that
law
which
is
it
mccollum
spokeswoman
kristy
campbell
said
mccollums
position
since
the
final
version
of
the
law
passed
has
been
consistent
she
says
mccollum
supports
the
law
arizona
passed
in
large
part
because
of
failures
at
the
federal
level
however
mccollum
thinks
an
arizonastyle
law
is
not
currently
needed
in
florida
because
of
the
states
unique
issues
dealing
with
immigration
but
mccollums
statements
to
the
media
on
may
13
and
may
16
are
just
too
different
to
us
and
warrant
