immigration
collisions
raids
against

the
raids
by
immigration
officials
in
six
states
this
week
stem
from
legitimate
concerns
it
should
go
without
saying
that
us
immigration
laws
warrant
enforcement
and
as
the
phrase
identity
theft
indicates
such
illegal
action
deserves
a
response
from
authorities
too
at
the
same
time
the
complexities
of
the
illegal
immigration
issue
are
many
raids
will
not
provide
a
longterm
remedy
the
difficulties
arise
in
part
because
the
immigration
issue
involves
two
important
collisions
a
collision
between
values
and
a
collision
between
economic
interests
the
values
collision
ask
leaders
and
activists
with
the
nebraska
republican
and
democratic
parties
and
they
will
acknowledge
a
key
finding
from
electionrelated
polling
by
both
parties
this
year
the
amount
of
exasperation
over
illegal
immigration
in
nebraska
is
tremendous
at
the
same
time
nebraska
has
a
large
latino
community
that
is
making
important
contributions
to
the
state
and
to
individual
communities
latinos
have
longestablished
roots
in
parts
of
the
state
particularly
the
panhandle
nebraskas
longterm
future
will
be
shaped
in
farranging
ways
by
its
latinos
the
sharp
difference
in
perspectives
over
illegal
immigration
is
not
going
away
nebraskans
on
each
side
of
the
issue
those
favoring
a
tough
stand
on
illegal
immigration
and
those
favoring
a
soft
one
have
deep
emotional
and
intellectual
commitments
to
their
stances
latinos
promoting
a
gentle
approach
to
illegal
immigration
need
to
acknowledge
the
legitimate
desire
by
other
nebraskans
for
this
countrys
immigration
laws
to
be
respected
not
flouted
nebraskans
angry
over
illegal
immigration
should
take
care
not
to
let
their
rhetorical
zeal
come
across
as
hostility
to
or
alienation
from
the
states
latino
residents
the
economics
collision
it
is
hardly
a
secret
that
some
employers
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
employment
of
illegal
immigrants
the
demand
for
an
end
to
such
practices
is
understandable
at
the
same
time
market
conditions
put
tremendous
pressure
on
employers
in
certain
sectors
to
hire
workers
without
serious
inquiry
into
their
immigration
status
some
of
those
employers
are
large
corporations
but
many
others
are
smaller
enterprises
how
far
the
federal
crackdown
should
go
to
end
such
practices
is
of
course
one
of
the
central
questions
confronting
federal
policymakers
another
economic
reality
is
that
immigration
raids
can
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
employers
some
of
the
nebraska
beef
products
from
the
swift
plant
in
grand
island
targeted
this
week
for
example
were
destined
for
the
export
market
at
a
time
when
nebraska
is
laboring
to
pry
open
asian
markets
closed
several
years
ago
in
the
wake
of
the
scare
over
mad
cow
disease
the
immigration
raids
thus
can
undercut
the
states
ability
to
export
its
products
this
doesnt
mean
the
raids
are
unjustified
it
means
that
like
many
government
actions
they
come
with
a
price
as
for
the
future
there
is
no
neat
solution
the
federal
identity
checks
had
failed
to
pick
up
false
id
claims
by
some
workers
at
the
raided
plants
this
week
for
example
the
best
that
can
be
hoped
for
is
a
compromise
involving
steppedup
enforcement
paired
with
an
improved
process
for
handling
immigration
claims
president
bush
and
us
sen
chuck
hagel
both
have
made
productive
points
on
this
matter
the
united
states
would
be
well
served
if
a
viable
bipartisan
agreement
could
be
reached
on
this
question
between
bush
and
the
new
democraticcontrolled
congress
such
an
agreement
would
be
an
imperfect
one
but
the
effort
is
crucial
and
the
debate
will
continue
given
the
unavoidable
collisions
involving
values
and
economics
