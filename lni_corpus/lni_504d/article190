the
house
voted
april
13
along
party
lines
to
approve
an
immigration
bill
that
will
significantly
change
the
way
local
lawenforcement
agencies
pursue
those
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
the
senate
must
now
approve
amendments
made
to
s1070
before
it
will
be
transmitted
to
gov
jan
brewer
for
a
signature
the
bills
supporters
say
it
will
take
the
handcuffs
off
our
law
enforcement
agents
by
ending
the
sanctuarycity
policies
that
shield
illegal
immigrants
from
law
enforcement
and
by
creating
a
new
state
trespass
law
that
applies
to
anyone
in
violation
of
federal
immigration
status
several
lawmakers
took
time
to
explain
their
support
or
opposition
to
the
bill
during
the
third
read
pointing
to
fixes
the
bill
received
recently
or
the
particulars
that
could
potentially
cause
problems
in
the
future
rep
chad
campbell
dphoenix
called
the
bill
a
red
herring
saying
that
the
real
solution
to
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
rests
with
federal
immigration
policy
and
increased
border
security
this
bill
does
nothing
campbell
said
declarations
of
support
for
the
bill
ranged
from
cautious
to
laudatory
rep
john
kavanagh
rfountain
hills
disagreed
with
campbell
saying
the
fights
against
illegal
immigration
must
be
waged
on
three
fronts
border
security
has
to
be
increased
jobs
and
benefits
must
not
be
available
and
internal
enforcement
must
be
ratcheted
up
kavanagh
said
s1070
is
a
major
achievement
in
internal
enforcement
those
opposing
sen
russell
pearces
immigration
crackdown
bill
listed
their
concerns
earlier
in
the
day
on
the
capitol
lawn
just
hours
before
the
house
was
slated
to
debate
and
vote
on
the
bill
the
arizona
interfaith
network
a
group
of
local
clergy
and
the
arizona
employers
for
immigration
reform
azeir
pointed
out
the
problems
they
saw
in
the
bill
highlighting
the
precarious
position
this
puts
law
enforcement
and
local
governments
into
as
well
as
the
overall
humanitarian
rights
trampling
they
see
this
bill
promoting
david
selden
an
employment
attorney
said
the
fundamental
problems
with
the
bill
are
that
police
throughout
arizona
will
have
to
abide
by
a
policy
of
racial
profiling
at
the
risk
of
bringing
lawsuits
to
his
or
her
agency
the
only
real
winners
here
will
be
the
lawyers
selden
said

the
bills
impact
sheridan
bailey
of
azeir
said
the
bill
would
put
arizona
in
uncharted
territory
for
immigration
law
and
said
the
results
will
be
disasterous
on
a
personal
and
community
level
this
community
is
not
a
laboratory
for
experimental
immigration
law
and
social
engineering
ideas
bailey
said
bailey
said
the
immigration
bills
pearce
has
authored
over
the
years
rely
on
mob
rule
and
intimidation
to
rally
support
he
went
on
to
read
a
psychological
profile
of
hitler
from
the
1940s
and
asked
whether
it
reminded
the
crowd
of
certain
politicians
in
the
legislature
all
it
takes
is
six
moderate
republicans
to
stand
up
to
this
bill
bailey
said
connie
andersen
a
representative
of
the
arizona
interfaith
network
said
later
that
her
organization
does
not
support
the
statements
of
mr
bailey
regarding
hitler
or
social
engineering
