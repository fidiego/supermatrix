todays
house
immigration
subcommittee
hearing
is
just
another
madefortelevision
event
that
will
titillate
cspan
viewers
but
few
others
on
deeper
examination
though
it
represents
the
beginning
of
a
landmark
debate
about
whether
a
key
element
of
the
american
dream
the
countrys
tradition
of
welcoming
immigrants
to
its
shores
has
gone
haywire
the
hearing
will
be
led
by
texas
republican
lamar
smith
who
has
promised
to
introduce
a
bill
next
month
to
overhaul
the
countrys
immigration
system
both
legal
and
illegal
from
top
to
bottom
the
debate
will
have
extraordinary
significance
for
california
where
about
onethird
of
legal
immigrants
settle
i
understand
we
all
are
immigrants
or
descendants
of
immigrants
but
the
united
states
is
like
a
boat
or
plane
said
yeh
lingling
an
orinda
resident
who
works
for
the
washingtonbased
carrying
capacity
network
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
the
line
and
say
were
all
full
she
and
other
restrictionists
argue
that
immigration
from
the
third
world
is
resulting
in
overcrowded
schools
and
a
cauldron
of
competition
for
low
skill
jobs
in
minority
communities
immigration
advocates
counter
that
the
newcomers
are
revitalizing
neighborhoods
and
generating
jobs
through
their
entrepreneurial
spirit
one
of
the
first
witnesses
at
todays
hearing
will
be
peter
brimelow
author
of
a
sizzling
new
book
called
alien
nation
its
tenet
the
united
states
is
committing
cultural
and
economic
suicide
by
accepting
too
many
third
world
immigrants
the
debate
about
legal
immigration
is
expected
to
pick
up
further
momentum
when
the
bipartisan
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
texas
rep
barbara
jordan
issues
recommendations
on
the
subject
next
month
some
politicians
predict
that
the
national
debate
that
will
emerge
during
the
next
few
months
is
bound
to
be
as
divisive
as
californias
debate
over
proposition
187
aimed
at
denying
public
services
to
illegal
immigrants
the
premise
of
alien
nation
and
antiimmigration
groups
is
basically
that
these
new
immigrants
dont
look
like
us
and
dont
sound
like
us
so
we
ought
to
fear
and
reject
them
said
robert
rubin
of
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
in
san
francisco
and
even
proposition
187s
leading
proponents
now
concede
that
the
debate
within
their
ranks
was
never
as
simple
as
their
own
campaign
rhetoric
some
people
just
werent
interested
in
whether
the
immigration
was
legal
or
illegal
said
rick
oltman
who
was
chairman
of
the
yes
on
187
save
our
state
committee
anytime
anybody
in
our
group
started
talking
about
legal
immigration
wed
cut
them
off
and
say
it
wasnt
pertinent
for
his
part
oltman
would
like
to
see
the
united
states
slash
legal
immigration
levels
by
at
least
a
third
and
im
a
moderate
in
that
group
oltman
said
laughing
he
agrees
with
brimelow
an
immigrant
from
england
on
one
major
point
right
now
our
immigration
policy
is
changing
the
racial
makeup
of
the
country
oltman
said
and
thats
never
been
done
before
in
history
the
countrys
changing
complexion
is
largely
the
result
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
amendments
of
1965
which
replaced
what
was
seen
as
a
racist
system
with
one
based
on
family
reunification
and
job
skills
most
immigration
restrictionists
though
say
their
reasons
are
environmental
not
racial
we
only
care
about
the
numbers
said
monique
miller
executive
director
of
the
carrying
capacity
network
her
6yearold
organization
and
the
older
federation
for
immigration
reform
fair
have
called
for
a
fiveyear
immigration
moratorium
to
give
the
country
a
chance
to
catch
its
breath
while
it
develops
a
new
immigration
policy
rep
bob
stump
rariz
and
sen
richard
shelby
rala
have
introduced
moratorium
bills
stumps
has
64
cosponsors
restrictionists
point
to
new
studies
showing
that
legal
immigrants
use
welfare
more
than
nativeborn
americans
and
they
say
nearly
twothirds
entering
every
year
are
lowskilled
reflecting
the
laborintensive
economy
of
the
past
rather
than
the
global
economy
of
the
future
i
talk
to
so
many
people
and
they
are
concerned
about
the
future
not
about
the
browning
of
america
said
restrictionist
yeh
an
ethnic
chinese
who
was
born
in
vietnam
and
raised
in
cambodia
before
immigrating
from
france
to
the
united
states
15
years
ago
they
just
feel
the
countrys
falling
apart
but
proimmigration
groups
which
include
a
righttoleft
array
of
business
interests
labor
unions
and
civil
rights
organizations
argue
that
the
restrictionists
are
using
hysteria
rather
than
reason
this
xenophobic
refrain
is
the
same
one
used
against
immigrants
100
years
ago
said
kathleen
sullivan
a
san
francisco
immigration
attorney
proimmigrant
organizations
argue
that
immigrants
tend
to
be
selfreliant
want
to
assimilate
and
live
in
strong
stable
families
i
meet
people
on
the
street
and
their
first
reaction
is
immigration
thats
terrible
you
have
to
do
something
about
it
said
warren
leiden
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
and
a
member
of
jordans
commission
but
leiden
said
that
once
he
explains
to
the
critics
that
modern
legal
immigration
is
mostly
based
on
uniting
families
and
its
not
some
gift
were
giving
to
strangers
many
americans
turn
around
on
the
issue
virtually
nobody
even
those
calling
for
a
moratorium
is
talking
about
denying
us
citizens
the
right
to
bring
in
spouses
and
unmarried
minor
children
but
some
restrictionists
are
questioning
whether
citizens
parents
should
be
automatically
entitled
to
enter
as
in
current
policy
another
possible
target
is
the
annual
lottery
aimed
at
increasing
immigration
from
areas
others
than
asia
and
latin
america
said
cecilia
munoz
of
the
pro
immigration
national
council
of
la
raza
the
lottery
program
is
the
one
that
doesnt
have
a
constituency
