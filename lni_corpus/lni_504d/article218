washington
on
the
eve
of
the
white
houses
longdelayed
bipartisan
meeting
today
to
kick
off
its
drive
to
revamp
us
immigration
policy
lawmakers
and
interest
groups
weighed
in
on
whats
needed
in
a
bill
on
wednesday
the
senator
tapped
to
write
it
democrat
charles
schumer
of
new
york
gave
his
most
detailed
outline
to
date
on
what
he
intends
to
include
in
an
immigration
bill
that
he
and
congressional
democratic
leaders
say
could
be
written
and
voted
on
this
fall
schumers
goal
is
to
balance
a
gettough
approach
to
illegal
immigration
while
still
providing
a
path
to
citizenship
for
the
nearly
12
million
illegal
immigrants
who
are
already
here
i
do
not
believe
that
a
bipartisan
immigration
bill
can
be
enacted
if
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
do
not
believe
that
democrats
are
serious
about
enforcement
schumer
told
a
conference
at
georgetown
university
schumer
said
democrats
can
no
longer
afford
to
use
soft
euphemistic
language
about
illegal
immigration
if
they
are
to
pass
an
immigration
bill
on
obamas
watch
when
we
use
phrases
like
undocumented
workers
we
convey
a
message
to
the
american
people
that
their
government
is
not
serious
about
combating
illegal
immigration
which
the
american
people
overwhelmingly
oppose
schumers
immigration
plan
includes
·
acknowledging
that
illegal
immigration
is
wrong
and
making
a
dramatic
reduction
in
future
illegal
immigration
a
priority
·
bolstering
infrastructure
technology
and
personnel
along
the
us
border
within
a
year
of
enactment
·
using
a
biometricbased
employer
verification
system
to
significantly
diminish
the
job
magnet
that
attracts
illegal
aliens
to
the
united
states
·
registering
all
illegal
aliens
inside
the
country
upon
enactment
of
the
new
law
and
having
them
submit
to
a
rigorous
process
of
converting
to
legal
status
and
earning
a
path
to
citizenship
or
face
imminent
deportment
·
making
reunification
of
families
a
cornerstone
value
of
our
immigration
system
·
encouraging
immigration
of
the
worlds
best
and
brightest
individuals
to
the
united
states
while
discouraging
businesses
from
using
immigration
laws
to
obtain
temporary
and
lessexpensive
foreign
labor
to
replace
capable
american
workers
·
changing
the
current
flow
of
unskilled
illegal
workers
into
a
more
manageable
flow
of
legal
ones
who
can
be
absorbed
by
the
economy
schumer
laid
down
his
markers
one
day
before
he
and
other
lawmakers
convene
at
the
white
house
to
launch
obamas
effort
to
overhaul
the
countrys
immigration
policy
a
goal
that
eluded
his
predecessor
george
w
bush
the
meeting
comes
after
two
postponements
which
prompted
some
immigration
advocates
to
question
obamas
commitment
to
hispanic
voters
obama
promised
during
the
presidential
campaign
that
he
would
address
immigration
in
his
first
year
in
office
that
vow
helped
him
earn
67
percent
of
the
hispanic
vote
to
republican
presidential
candidate
john
mccains
31
percent
we
see
this
as
really
a
critical
moment
of
truth
on
immigration
said
the
most
rev
jaime

the

of
sacramento
calif
and
a

bishops
committee

migration
tomorrows

tell
us
if
the
administration
is
serious
about
enacting
comprehensive
immigration
reform
this
year
white
house
officials
and
congressional
democratic
leaders
have
given
mixed
signals
on
how
eager
they
are
to
move
immigration
forward
their
agenda
is
already
loaded
with
complex
urgent
challenges
including
an
overhaul
of
national
health
insurance
trying
to
cap
carbon
emissions
redesigning
financial
regulation
and
confirming
a
new
justice
for
the
supreme
court
white
house
press
secretary
robert
gibbs
said
monday
that
obama
would
like
to
see
immigration
addressed
this
year
but
added
currently

math
makes
that
real
difficult
