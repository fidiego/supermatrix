highlightÂ practical
bipartisan
voices
can
prevail
despite
political
pressure
last
weekend
a
handful
of
republican
congressmen
tried
to
tamp
down
any
new
momentum
for
immigration
reform
a
few
lawmakers
and
party
strategists
said
they
doubted
reform
could
pass
in
the
gopled
house
because
president
obama
could
not
be
trusted
to
enforce
immigration
laws
that
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
obama
has
aggressively
enforced
the
existing
laws
by
deporting
about
2
million
undocumented
immigrants
the
highest
number
for
any
president
fortunately
the
just
say
no
to
immigration
reform
faction
isnt
the
only
voice
last
week
wiser
gop
heads
released
a
set
of
immigration
principles
that
have
the
potential
to
lead
to
muchneeded
compromise
on
federal
immigration
laws
there
is
nearly
universal
agreement
that
the
united
states
broken
immigration
policy
should
be
fixed
current
circumstances
send
this
mixed
message
businesses
are
eagerly
hiring
the
undocumented
workers
to
fill
lowerpaying
jobs
yet
we
want
all
immigrants
to
follow
our
cumbersome
rules
for
legal
immigration
to
fix
those
contradictions
the
us
senate
passed
a
comprehensive
reform
bill
last
year
and
following
a
retreat
last
week
for
the
first
time
house
republican
leaders
said
they
would
be
open
to
having
americas
12
million
undocumented
immigrants
live
and
work
legally
although
the
gop
leaders
fell
short
of
supporting
a
special
path
for
them
to
become
citizens
the
principles
say
the
undocumented
must
get
right
with
the
law
an
important
change
from
the
selfdeportation
theme
some
in
the
gop
have
echoed
in
recent
years
in
addition
to
allowing
many
immigrants
to
remain
in
this
country
lawfully
the
plan
would
improve
the
nations
immigration
system
and
strengthen
efforts
to
combat
illegal
immigration
unlike
the
senate
plan
it
would
not
provide
a
track
to
citizenship
except
for
those
brought
here
illegally
by
their
parents
granting
some
form
of
legal
status
to
undocumented
workers
is
the
right
thing
to
do
it
would
allow
them
to
come
out
of
hiding
and
live
as
full
members
of
society
there
should
also
be
a
reasonable
path
to
citizenship
but
legal
status
would
be
a
major
step
forward
in
his
state
of
the
union
address
obama
sounded
open
to
compromise
to
move
immigration
reform
along
this
year
and
so
are
many
proimmigration
groups
a
recent
pew
research
center
survey
found
that
55
percent
of
hispanics
believe
it
is
more
important
to
get
relief
from
the
threat
of
deportation
than
it
is
to
secure
citizenship
comprehensive
legislation
also
would
help
address
some
critical
immigration
issues
that
dont
have
enough
support
to
survive
on
their
own
it
would
overhaul
the
system
of
visas
and
green
cards
for
highly
skilled
workers
and
it
would
strengthen
the
everify
program
for
checking
the
status
of
workers
as
they
apply
for
jobs
a
good
compromise
should
be
possible
house
committees
already
have
approved
measures
that
would
increase
border
security
add
visas
for
workers
and
require
employers
to
use
everify
all
of
those
provisions
are
included
in
the
senate
bill
and
there
is
broad
support
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
to
offer
citizenship
to
dreamers
the
17
million
young
people
who
were
brought
to
this
country
illegally
as
children
theres
another
reason
reform
should
be
adopted
this
year
it
would
be
good
for
the
economy
obama
made
that
point
during
his
state
of
the
union
address
and
economists
overwhelmingly
say
that
improving
the
immigration
system
will
lead
to
stronger
economic
growth
the
republican
faction
that
wants
to
stop
immigration
reform
appears
to
be
more
motivated
by
politics
than
whats
right
for
the
country
theyd
rather
hammer
away
at
problems
with
obamacare
and
avoid
immigration
action
altogether
to
boost
chances
at
winning
more
midterm
elections
our
hope
is
that
the
more
reasonable
members
of
both
parties
will
prevail
and
make
meaningful
progress
on
immigration
reform
for
the
good
of
the
country
ray
of
hope
while
these
standards
house
republican
immigration
principals
are
certainly
not
everything
we
would
agree
with
they
leave
a
real
possibility
that
democrats
and
republicans
can
in
some
way
come
together
and
pass
immigration
reform
that
both
sides
can
accept
it
is
a
long
hard
road
but
the
door
is
open
