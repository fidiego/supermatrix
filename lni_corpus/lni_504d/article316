a
permanent
federal
immigration
court
along
with
an
immigration
judge
and
two
trial
attorneys
to
prosecute
the
cases
is
coming
to
utah
us
sen
orrin
hatch
rutah
who
as
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
has
been
pushing
the
department
of
justice
for
months
to
establish
an
immigration
court
in
utah
confirmed
monday
what
he
told
the
deseret
morning
news
last
month
that
utah
would
soon
be
getting
the
new
court
we
must
protect
our
borders
and
be
vigilant
in
the
enforcement
of
our
immigration
laws
hatch
said
utahs
need
to
address
immigration
issues
is
evident
in
our
dramatic
increase
in
immigration
cases
hatch
said
the
number
of
new
utah
immigration
cases
requiring
adjudication
has
grown
from
about
340
in
2000
to
more
than
1000
cases
in
2003
we
had
all
kinds
of
problems
because
of
the
dramatic
increase
in
cases
hatch
said
he
noted
the
number
of
new
cases
has
tripled
creating
a
backlog
and
delaying
justice
it
seems
to
me
that
placing
an
immigration
court
in
utah
will
produce
swifter
processing
of
cases
to
be
heard
and
resolved
he
said
having
a
federal
immigration
judge
in
utah
will
help
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
office
in
salt
lake
to
process
criminal
aliens
and
others
who
need
to
be
seen
by
an
immigration
judge
hatch
said
it
will
also
permit
local
immigration
officials
to
address
the
existing
and
growing
case
load
and
also
provide
the
opportunity
for
utah
immigration
cases
to
be
heard
in
person
before
a
judge
he
said
minority
leaders
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
late
monday
immigration
courts
are
established
by
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
eoir
within
the
department
of
justice
which
also
appoints
the
judges
who
are
not
subject
to
senate
approval
decisions
reached
by
the
immigration
courts
can
be
appealed
to
a
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
just
as
cases
can
be
appealed
from
a
us
district
court
historically
utah
has
been
part
of
the
denver
district
for
immigration
cases
and
judges
used
to
fly
to
utah
frequently
to
hear
cases
more
recently
in
the
wake
of
a
growing
backlog
of
cases
the
department
of
justice
has
resorted
to
teleconferencing
the
judicial
proceedings
that
said
hatch
is
no
way
to
arrive
at
fair
and
equitable
justice
utah
is
not
alone
with
its
burgeoning
immigration
problems
other
cities
around
the
country
have
experienced
similar
increases
in
immigration
cases
particularly
after
the
department
of
justice
began
increasing
the
profile
of
immigration
cases
after
the
911
terrorist
attacks
it
certainly
didnt
hurt
that
hatch
who
this
month
stepped
down
as
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
was
in
a
powerful
position
to
persuade
thenattorney
general
john
ashcroft
that
utah
should
be
moved
to
the
front
of
the
line
the
immigration
problem
in
utah
is
only
going
to
get
worse
we
are
the
crossroads
of
the
west
he
said
we
have
really
needed
this
and
i
am
happy
we
have
succeeded
in
this
effort
he
said
the
new
court
is
expected
to
be
operational
