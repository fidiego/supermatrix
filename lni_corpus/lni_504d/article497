that
naturalized
united
states
citizens
are
committing
suicide
or
driving
their
wives
and
children
back
to
mexico
out
of
fear
that
their
families
will
fail
to
qualify
for
amnesty
then
ignorance
of
united
states
immigration
law
has
reached
lethal
proportions
there
is
no
need
for
spouses
parents
or
minor
children
of
united
states
citizens
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
amnesty
program
created
by
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
these
immediate
relatives
of
united
states
citizens
are
virtually
guaranteed
legal
status
under
the
general
immigration
law
to
which
the
1986
act
was
a
series
of
amendments
the
process
is
quicker
and
often
cheaper
than
applying
for
amnesty
a
trained
immigration
counselor
whether
a
lawyer
or
a
lay
counselor
could
tell
such
citizens
that
their
wives
and
children
are
almost
assured
of
legal
admission
and
could
advise
them
on
how
to
apply
for
it
the
counselor
could
also
reassure
them
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
does
not
deport
family
members
if
immediaterelative
applications
are
being
adjudicated
money
for
application
fees
and
medical
examinations
can
be
a
severe
problem
for
some
applicants
but
it
does
not
appear
to
be
major
in
new
york
city
a
greater
problem
is
the
scarcity
of
lowcost
immigration
counselors
to
guide
clients
through
the
immigration
maze
passage
of
last
years
immigration
law
has
brought
many
more
community
agencies
into
immigration
counseling
but
it
is
still
painfully
evident
that
lowcost
agencies
are
always
understaffed
and
sometimes
undertrained
for
their
work
one
hopes
that
public
awareness
of
the
pervasive
and
varied
need
exposed
by
the
new
law
will
increase
public
and
private
support
for
training
and
immigration
work
even
after
the
legalization
program
created
by
the
new
immigration
act
has
run
its
course
the
cases
that
todays
immigration
counselors
face
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
just
undocumented
aliens
who
need
immigration
counseling
it
is
also
legal
aliens
and
united
states
citizens
