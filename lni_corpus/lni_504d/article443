ah
the
ongoing
drama
of
the
immigration
debate
it
shows
how
fear
can
make
the
most
rational
among
us
irrational
immigration
reform
is
critical
we
are
late
in
resolving
the
issue
through
comprehensive
repair
of
the
laws
its
amazing
to
see
rational
and
intelligent
people
froth
at
the
mouth
as
they
talk
about
illegals
and
how
the
undocumented
population
should
all
be
rounded
up
and
deported
without
knowing
anything
about
immigration
laws
they
refer
back
to
their
parents
and
grandparents
immigrant
story
as
if
that
option
still
exists
preferring
to
rest
in
stale
arguments
than
to
acknowledge
the
realities
of
migration
antiimmigrant
sentiment
is
not
new
in
the
us
however
in
a
country
built
on
the
backs
of
immigrant
labor
whose
economy
still
depends
upon
immigrants
contributions
and
celebrates
its
immigrant
heritage
isnt
it
a
bit
hypocritical
congress
has
applied
piecemeal
approaches
to
immigration
over
the
past
216
years
resulting
in
a
nonresponsive
underfunded
system
prior
to
1952
there
was
no
orderly
system
of
legal
immigration
immigration
laws
were
scattered
throughout
the
us
code
in
1790
the
first
immigration
law
required
immigrants
to
live
in
the
us
for
two
years
before
becoming
citizens
in
1795
that
was
changed
to
five
years
it
was
raised
to
14
years
in
1798
when
a
registry
of
immigrants
was
created
a
week
later
congress
passed
the
first
deportation
law
thereafter
laws
defined
who
was
unwelcome
in
the
us
the
first
alien
enemy
law
chinese
workers
people
from
latin
america
and
women
in
1924
the
first
quota
system
was
established
consular
processing
requiring
foreign
nationals
to
obtain
visas
to
come
to
the
us
was
codified
in
1952
the
immigration
nationality
act
was
implemented
corralling
the
piecemeal
laws
in
the
us
code
and
establishing
the
family
immigration
system
several
attempts
to
address
discrimination
were
imposed
reversing
exclusion
of
certain
races
from
citizenship
and
allowing
single
women
to
immigrate
however
there
was
no
funding
mechanism
for
the
agency
issuing
immigration
benefits
in
1965
the
visaallocation
system
was
established
and
has
not
been
significantly
changed
nor
has
the
worldwide
distribution
of
immigrant
visas
been
adjusted
to
meet
migration
flows
from
western
europe
to
the
current
reality
latin
america
the
asianpacific
region
and
the
african
continent
since
1790
142
immigration
laws
have
passed
in
response
to
a
political
crisis
each
based
upon
exclusion
and
not
the
realities
of
migration
flows
family
reunification
or
our
need
for
low
and
midskilled
laborers
people
came
to
the
us
50
years
ago
through
quota
immigration
largely
done
away
with
in
the
1950s
in
the
1980s
the
lowskilled
immigration
system
was
gutted
lowskilled
labor
categories
were
largely
excised
from
the
laws
over
the
past
20
years
family
immigration
has
been
derailed
creating
barriers
to
family
reunification
and
incountry
status
regularization
border
security
cannot
be
addressed
without
comprehensive
immigration
reform
reinstatement
of
lowskilled
labor
classifications
reestablishment
of
due
process
for
people
facing
removal
protection
of
asylumseekers
and
unaccompanied
minors
and
commensurate
funding
for
citizenship
immigration
services
the
path
to
citizenship
begins
with
legal
permanent
residency
and
theres
no
gate
there
is
no
mechanism
for
a
lowskilled
worker
to
become
a
legal
permanent
resident
nor
is
there
an
efficient
timely
way
to
reunify
families
no
it
was
never
orderly
and
its
time
to
fix
it
