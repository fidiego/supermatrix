a
mexican
immigrant
in
the
borderland
who
has
lived
in
the
shadows
for
more
than
10
years
is
among
the
millions
of
undocumented
immigrants
who
are
looking
to
the
new
administration
to
lead
the
way
for
immigration
reform
i
have
friends
and
relatives
some
who
have
legalized
their
status
and
others
who
remain
in
a
precarious
immigration
status
barreno
said
we
are
all
hoping
the
new
president
barack
obama
will
take
us
into
account
barreno
learned
through
news
reports
that
obama
has
a
relative
who
is
an
undocumented
immigrant
it
brings
home
the
issue
she
said
i
hope
it
also
serves
to
raise
the
consciousness
of
the
public
and
the
president
about
the
need
to
address
our
dire
situation
i
feel
especially
feel
bad
for
the
students
who
finish
high
school
and
cannot
go
on
to
college
because
they
are
considered
illegals
obamas

halfsister
was
ordered
to
leave
the
country
in
2004
by
an
immigration
judge
who
rejected
her
request
for
asylum
from
kenya
she
now
lives
in
the
united
states
as
an
undocumented
immigrant
according
to
the
associated
press
katherine
vargas
spokeswoman
for
the
national
immigration
forum
in
washington
said
the
big
turnout
by
hispanic
voters
in
tuesdays
election
makes
immigration
reform
a
mandate
for
the
new
president
about
105
million
latinos
voted
and
this
creates
a
political
space
and
momentum
to
push
for
immigration
reform
vargas
said
the
presidentelect
acknowledged
that
the
system
is
broken
we
saw
an
example
of
this
in
the
raids
in
iowa
in
may
that
netted
183
immigrants
and
cost
taxpayers
6
million
she
said
the
forum
which
advocates
for
policies
that
are
welcoming
to
all
immigrants
also
expects
changes
at
law
enforcement
agencies
like
the
border
patrol
and
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
the
center
for
immigration
studies
in
washington
has
spent
years
researching
and
testifying
on
the
downside
of
immigration
it
estimates
one
in
eight
people
in
the
united
states
is
an
immigrant
and
one
in
three
of
those
are
undocumented
immigrants
the
centers
executive
director
mark
krikorian
argues
against
further
immigration
in
his
book
the
new
case
against
immigration
both
legal
and
illegal
he
has
written
opinion
articles
against
amnesty
and
supports
reducing
illegal
immigration
through
steppedup
enforcement
modern
america
has
simply
outgrown
immigration
and
we
must
end
it
before
it
cripples
the
center
says
in
its
online
book
description
at
wwwcisorg
although
immigration
was
absent
from
the
englishlanguage
presidential
candidate
debates
the
two
major
candidates
spent
money
on
spanishlanguage
media
to
reach
out
to
hispanics
during
the
campaigns
according
to
immigration
analysts
clarissa
martinez
immigration
director
for
the
national
council
of
la
raza
in
washington
said
small
but
vocal
antiimmigrant
groups
mobilized
a
strong
lobby
against
immigration
reform
by
congress
last
year
federal
lawmakers
came
close
to
passing
a
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bill
but
failed
to
get
it
past
a
bloc
in
the
senate
but
weve
gone
through
three
electoral
cycles
and
these
groups
have
shown
they
cant
deliver
at
the
election
booth
she
said
in
the
previous
election
latinos
went
with
the
republicans
and
this
time
they
sided
with
democrats
because
of
the
immigration
issue
they
cant
be
taken
for
granted
because
the
latinos
can
swing
the
other
way
again
in
the
el
paso
sector
border
patrol
apprehensions
over
the
past
four
years
fell
by
75
percent
prompting
critics
to
say
the
border
fence
under
construction
is
not
needed
the
section
of
the
fence
in
el
paso
is
supposed
to
be
finished
by
the
end
of
the
year
