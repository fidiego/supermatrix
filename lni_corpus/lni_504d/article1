when
the
british
government
surveyed
employment
in
the
city
of
london
recently
it
came
across
a
pleasingly
symmetrical
fact
about
onethird
of
the
highskilled
workers
were
foreigners
and
so
were
about
onethird
of
the
lowskilled
workers
this
knowledge
that
foreign
workers
are
critical
to
the
most
dynamic
sector
of
the
economy
has
not
stopped
gordon
brown
the
prime
minister
from
growling
about
british
jobs
for
british
workers
across
the
developed
world
politicians
such
as
mr
brown
are
responding
to
public
fears
about
high
levels
of
immigration
in
italy
last
week
police
backed
by
bulldozers
swept
through
settlements
of
romanian
immigrants
in
the
us
hillary
clinton
recently
made
the
first
false
step
in
her
formidable
presidential
election
campaign
by
sounding
soft
on
illegal
immigration
some
antiimmigration
activists
think
we
are
now
reaching
a
tipping
point
in
both
western
europe
and
north
america
immigration
is
becoming
such
a
hot
political
issue
that
politicians
will
be
forced
to
clamp
down
the
period
of
high
migration
will
come
to
a
close
i
doubt
it
this
is
not
as
some
argue
because
it
would
be
impossible
to
clamp
down
the
reason
is
more
heartening
most
western
societies
do
not
have
the
stomach
to
take
the
extremely
tough
and
illiberal
measures
that
would
be
needed
immigration
is
so
controversial
that
the
search
for
a
middle
ground
sounds
futile
but
i
was
surprised
to
discover
at
a
recent
ditchley
foundation
conference
that
there
are
things
that
the
pro
and
anti
camps
agree
on
first
everybody
agrees
that
while
the
data
are
lousy
we
are
in
a
period
of
high
migration
second
both
sides
of
the
debate
are
really
talking
about
managed
migration
there
are
very
few
antiimmigration
activists
who
actually
want
no
new
migrants
and
even
the
most
liberal
advocates
of
free
movement
of
labour
rarely
argue
for
dismantling
all
immigration
controls
it
also
became
apparent
that
the
argument
is
ultimately
about
political
and
social
choices
rather
than
economics
of
course
economic
needs
drive
many
of
the
flows
of
people
migrants
move
to
find
work
and
employers
want
rare
skills
or
cheap
and
willing
labour
but
the
economic
effects
of
all
this
migration
are
ambiguous
a
british
study
recently
suggested
that
while
immigration
has
increased
the
size
of
the
uk
economy
it
has
not
significantly
increased
percapita
income
in
the
short
term
immigrants
may
make
life
tougher
for
unskilled
nativeborn
workers
over
the
longer
term
immigrants
tend
to
be
a
dynamic
group
who
found
businesses
and
create
jobs
you
can
argue
the
economics
either
way
the
thesis
that
immigration
cannot
be
controlled
is
also
unconvincing
it
all
depends
on
the
measures
you
are
prepared
to
take
when
the
danish
government
brought
in
draconian
restrictions
on
arranged
marriages
and
asylumseekers
it
did
drive
down
the
number
of
migrants
to
the
country
if
the
us
really
were
to
build
a
giant
fence
along
its
mexican
border
it
probably
would
reduce
illegal
immigration
both
examples
underline
something
important
about
the
immigration
debate
in
the
rich
world
the
fatalists
are
wrong
this
is
not
about
unstoppable
economic
forces
there
are
political
choices
to
be
made
opinion
polls
in
north
america
and
western
europe
suggest
at
first
glance
that
those
choices
will
increasingly
be
to
restrict
immigration
there
are
times
when
public
concern
about
immigration
peaks
and
politicians
feel
compelled
to
take
action
italy
facing
a
recent
influx
of
up
to
500000
romanians
seems
to
be
in
that
situation
now
the
netherlands
a
few
years
ago
underwent
a
political
upheaval
when
pim
fortuyn
created
a
new
party
capitalising
on
unease
about
highlevels
of
muslim
immigration
but
the
dutch
example
is
less
clearcut
than
it
appears
antiimmigration
sentiment
seems
to
have
waned
in
the
past
couple
of
years
postfortuyn
political
parties
that
based
their
pitch
on
restricting
immigration
have
not
really
prospered
the
danish
election
today
may
also
show
a
decline
in
the
power
of
the
antiimmigration
movement
in
britain
efforts
by
the
conservatives
to
play
the
immigration
card
have
not
been
crowned
with
political
success
in
the
us
tom
tancredo
a
leader
of
the
campaign
against
illegal
immigration
has
made
no
headway
in
his
bid
for
the
republican
nomination
for
the
presidency
this
may
be
because
in
normal
times
antiimmigration
sentiment
is
simply
not
important
enough
to
determine
how
people
vote
but
it
also
suggests
that
voters
are
more
attached
to
the
principles
of
an
open
society
than
the
raw
polling
data
on
immigration
suggest
it
is
certainly
possible
to
crack
down
on
legal
and
illegal
immigration
but
the
necessary
measures
would
often
involve
sacrificing
freedom
and
convenience
you
could
have
much
tougher
controls
at
borders
and
even
longer
waitingtimes
at
immigration
control
forget
just
hopping
on
the
eurostar
to
paris
you
could
introduce
identity
cards
in
countries
such
as
the
us
and
the
netherlands
that
have
long
resisted
them
you
could
bind
employers
in
even
more
red
tape
you
could
restrict
peoples
right
to
marry
you
could
arrange
mass
deportations
of
illegal
immigrants
and
shut
your
eyes
to
the
resulting
injustices
some
combination
of
all
of
those
measures
probably
would
dramatically
reduce
immigration
but
in
the
process
you
would
risk
creating
countries
that
are
not
only
less
welcoming
to
immigrants
they
would
probably
be
much
less
palatable
for
nativeborn
citizens
as
well
