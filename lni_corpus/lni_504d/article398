the
haitian
soldiers
who
went
to
the
womans
house
that
day
wore
stockings
over
their
heads
to
disguise
their
faces
they
mocked
her
political
work
in
support
of
jeanbertrand
aristide
the
president
overthrown
a
few
months
earlier
in
a
military
coup
they
threatened
to
kill
her
then
while
her
mother
was
forced
to
watch
three
soldiers
raped
and
beat
her
the
woman
who
was
27
and
married
is
unable
to
bear
children
as
a
result
of
the
attacks
she
fled
to
the
united
states
in
july
1992
five
months
after
the
attacks
and
sought
political
asylum
her
request
was
denied
a
us
immigration
judge
ruled
that
she
had
failed
to
prove
she
was
persecuted
because
of
her
political
beliefs
but
last
month
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
overturned
the
decision
the
board
an
administrative
decisionmaking
body
found
that
her
rape
was
a
form
of
political
persecution
in
a
ruling
that
all
asylum
officers
and
immigration
judges
are
now
required
to
apply
in
deciding
similar
cases
last
week
in
a
related
step
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
issued
new
guidelines
formally
recognizing
that
rape
domestic
abuse
and
other
forms
of
violence
against
women
can
constitute
grounds
for
asylum
only
canada
had
previously
adopted
such
specific
measures
on
asylum
cases
related
to
gender
the
guidelines
and
the
board
decision
reflect
a
growing
recognition
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
that
violence
against
women
solely
because
they
are
women
can
constitute
serious
human
rights
violations
and
should
therefore
be
considered
when
granting
asylum
in
the
past
the
fact
that
an
asylum
claim
was
based
on
a
rape
or
some
other
genderrelated
factor
would
result
in
its
dismissal
as
merely
personal
by
us
immigration
authorities
even
if
it
amounted
to
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion
according
to
deborah
anker
a
founding
member
of
the
women
refugees
project
at
harvard
law
school
and
the
cambridge
and
somerville
legal
services
the
group
was
instrumental
in
helping
the
ins
develop
the
guidelines
until
quite
recently
there
were
few
federal
court
decisions
that
addressed
the
claims
of
women
to
asylum
protection
even
tangentially
she
said
but
in
the
last
few
years
there
has
been
growing
attention
to
human
rights
abuses
based
on
gender
prompted
in
part
by
international
atrocities
such
as
the
mass
rape
of
women
in
bosnia
as
part
of
ethnic
cleansing
the
systematic
use
of
rape
in
haiti
by
police
and
soldiers
during
and
after
the
1991
coup
against
aristide
and
the
domestic
violence
in
rwanda
immigration
officials
and
advocates
said
these
claims
werent
made
in
the
past
but
theyre
beginning
to
be
made
now
said
t
alexander
aleinikoff
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
in
an
important
decision
last
december
an
immigration
judge
in
arlington
granted
political
asylum
for
the
first
time
to
a
51yearold
jordanian
woman
whose
government
had
failed
to
protect
her
from
over
three
decades
of
physical
and
mental
abuse
by
her
husband
the
immigration
service
initially
turned
down
her
request
for
asylum
arguing
that
it
was
simply
a
case
of
domestic
abuse
that
should
be
settled
in
another
forum
the
husband
was
from
a
wealthy
wellconnected
jordanian
family
among
his
good
friends
was
the
head
of
the
secret
police
who
gave
him
a
gun
that
the
husband
later
used
to
shoot
at
his
wife
after
getting
drunk
the
husband
often
beat
his
wife
even
when
she
was
pregnant
and
once
used
a
tennis
racket
to
hit
her
when
he
found
her
studying
for
a
high
school
equivalency
exam
in
his
decision
judge
paul
a
najelski
wrote
that
the
woman
had
been
persecuted
because
she
sought
her
own
identity
and
espoused
western
values
in
a
country
where
wives
generally
are
expected
to
subordinate
themselves
to
their
husbands
also
she
was
among
a
group
of
women
who
were
unwilling
to
live
their
lives
in
a
harem
at
the
mercy
of
their
husbands
their
society
and
their
government
he
wrote
this
ruling
marked
the
first
recognition
that
spousal
abuse
can
become
a
form
of
persecution
under
some
conditions
the
jordanian
woman
had
suffered
at
her
husbands
hands
because
of
her
beliefs
and
she
could
not
get
real
protection
from
the
jordanian
authorities
because
of
those
same
beliefs
the
ins
guidelines
took
effect
immediately
they
do
not
lower
the
standard
for
asylum
that
must
be
met
for
women
women
will
have
to
meet
the
same
basic
tests
as
men
and
all
asylum
cases
will
continue
to
be
decided
on
a
casebycase
basis
applicants
seeking
asylum
in
the
united
states
must
still
demonstrate
a
wellfounded
fear
of
persecution
based
on
race
religion
nationality
political
opinion
or
membership
in
a
particular
social
group
some
groups
that
favor
less
immigration
such
as
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
have
argued
that
permitting
genderrelated
asylum
claims
will
produce
a
rush
of
claims
by
many
thousands
of
women
who
will
see
an
easy
opportunity
to
obtain
legal
status
in
the
united
states
we
cannot
bring
people
here
simply
because
they
are
suffering
under
general
cultural
forms
of
oppression
said
dan
stein
president
of
fair
although
most
of
the
worlds
refugees
are
women
and
children
supporters
of
the
new
guidelines
argue
that
women
are
often
the
least
able
to
leave
refugee
camps
or
their
native
countries
to
seek
asylum
abroad
and
are
unlikely
to
produce
the
flood
of
asylum
claims
that
opponents
fear
in
the
two
years
since
canada
adopted
specific
guidelines
195
genderrelated
claims
for
asylum
were
accepted
according
to
canadian
officials
that
accounts
for
about
2
percent
of
all
canadian
asylum
claims
filed
since
the
guidelines
went
into
effect
in
the
united
states
there
were
147000
asylum
applications
last
year
almost
triple
the
number

1991
