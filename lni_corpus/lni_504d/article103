v
united
states
challenges
the
authority
of
a
state
to
enact
its
own
immigration
enforcement
laws
instead
of
following
federal
regulations
sb1070
signed
into
law
in
april
2010
included
many
antiillegalimmigration
provisions
and
reignited
the
immigration
debate
in
the
country
sparking
similar
laws
in
other
states
including
georgia
alabama
and
south
carolina
in
orange
county
the
law
mobilized
residents
longtime
immigration
activists
and
legislators
to
take
a
stand
on
the
issue
some
residents
even
traveled
to
arizona
for
rallies
supporting
and
opposing
the
measure
barbara
coe
who
went
to
arizona
with
a
contingent
of
people
to
rally
in
support
of
the
law
said
she
is
sending

to
the
1700
people
in
her
list
keeping
them
updated
and
urging
them
to
voice
their
support
for

were
certainly
pushing
the
best
we
can
to
put

hope
the
nations
highest
court
will
side
with
the
us
government
laws
like
sb1070
encourage
racial
profiling
but
they
also
make
our

like

states
we
should
not
be
forcing

said
wendy

director
of
clergy
and
laity
united
for
economic
justice
of
orange
county
our
nation
needs
to
fix
immigration
at
the
federal
level
through
comprehensive
immigration
reform
she
said
we
need
to
halt
this
patchwork
of
immigration
regulations
at
the
state
levels
that
are
ineffective
and
shortsighted
and
get
to
the
real
task
of
passing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
gives
clear
pathways
for
citizenship
the
most
controversial
part
of
sb1070
gives
officials
the
authority
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
detained
by
police
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
may
be
in
the
country

a
us
district
court
judge

the
us
justice
department
launched
a
lawsuit
against
arizona
us
officials
contend
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
arizona
was
attempting
to
take
the
role
of
the
federal
government
arizona
authorities
argue
that
the
law
is
an
effort
to
cooperate
with
federal
officials
stating
that
its
the
only
way
to
defend
their
state
from
what
they
have
described
as
a
flood
