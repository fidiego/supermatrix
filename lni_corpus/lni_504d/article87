how
the
immigration
policy
stalemate
is
hurting
businesses
and
the
economy
examines
the
recent
53
supreme
court
ruling
that
struck
down
much
of
arizonas
controversial
2010
immigration
law
and
its
implications
for
employers
nationwide
while
the
decision
in
arizona
v
us
eased
many
employers
anxieties
by
affirming
the
supremacy
of
federal
immigration
law
over
a
hodgepodge
of
state
legislation
some
experts
say
that
us
immigration
policy
is
still
stymieing
economic
growth
preemption
affirmed
in
its
arizona
v
us
ruling
the
court
overturned
three
of
the
immigration
laws
four
provisions
one
of
which
barred
illegal
immigrants
from
seeking
work
or
being
employed
in
arizona
writing
for
the
majority
justice
kennedy
noted
that
federal
law
has
already
laid
down
guidelines
for
employment
verification
and
alien
registration
which
preempt
state
regulations
some
experts
believe
the
courts
ruling
will
dissuade
other
states
from
passing
immigration
legislation
of
their
own
employers
can
breathe
a
bit
easier
with
the
implications
from
this
ruling
that
the
growing
trend
of
a
patchwork
of
different
states
immigration
laws
may
finally
abate
said
jackson
lewis
partner
sean
hanagan
enhanced
enforcement
in
his
first
term
president
obama
has
shifted
the
focus
of
immigration
policy
from
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
raids
to
ice
paperwork
audits
and
fines
with
the
aim
of
deporting
illegal
immigrants
with
criminal
records
he
has
also
instituted
policies
such
as
the
recent
dream
act
which
would
allow
some
young
illegal
immigrants
brought
to
the
us
as
children
to
remain
in
the
country
the
nature
of
enforcement
has
changed
according
to
ford
harrison
partner
charles
roach
now
the
focus
is
on
the
employer
and
doing
desk
audits
of
i9s
the
incidence
of
i9
audits
has
increased
in
number
frequency
and
fines
under
the
obama
administration
hiring
handcuff
the
us
v
arizona
ruling
settled
the
question
of
arizonas
immigration
law
but
many
uncertainties
remain
when
it
comes
to
the
uss
broader
immigration
policies
which
some
say
are
hampering
economic
growth
especially
at
issue
are
visa
caps
and
quotas
that
can
complicate
the
hiring
of
overseas
workers
we
have
a
worldwide
economy
and
with
advances
in
technology
it
is
possible
to
employ
people
abroad
and
remain
productive
said
andrew
merrills
shareholder
at
ogletree
deakins
this
has
a
very
negative
effect
on
the
us
economy
call
for
action
americans
have
the
economy
on
the
brain
this
election
season
and
immigration
policy
is
an
integral
part
of
economic
development
according
to
a
recent
report
from
the
partnership
from
the
new
america
the
report
advocates
revised
visa
caps
and
green
card
policies
especially
as
they
apply
to
workers
in
the
fields
of
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
when
firms
cannot
find
the
scientific
talent
they
need
among
native
workers
they
have
two
options
hire
immigrants
to
fill
these
vital
jobs
or
establish
facilities
in
countries
with
more
welcoming
immigration
policies
the
report
said
conclusion
with
its
arizona
v
us
decision
the
supreme
court
largely
gutted
the
states
immigration
legislation
in
doing
so
the
court
reaffirmed
the
federal
governments
supremacy
over
state
governments
in
the
immigration
arena
but
the
ruling
did
not
resolve
the
complexities
of
an
immigration
system
that
some
say
is
stifling
economic
growth
and
hindering
the
uss
ability
to
attract
talent
in
the
global
marketplace
