immigrants
are
the
lifeblood
of
the
country
and
americans
must
not
forget
it
that
was
the
message
from
mayor
bloomberg
yesterday
when
he
visited
citizenship
now
and
thanked
the
daily
news
and
cuny
for
coming
together
to
help
unravel
callers
complex
immigration
issues
this
is
a
country
that
was
built
on
people
coming
from
around
the
world
to
be
in
charge
of
their
own
destiny
unfortunately
in
this
country
some
people
have
forgotten
what
made
us
great
he
said
i
want
to
congratulate
cuny
and
the
department
of
immigrant
affairs
and
particularly
the
daily
news
with
doing
all
this
bloombergs
comments
came
a
day
after
tens
of
thousands
of
immigrants
around
the
country
marched
in
favor
of
creating
a
path
to
citizenship
for
the
countrys
estimated
12
million
illegals
walking
around
the
call
center
bloomberg
said
residents
need
to
acknowledge
the
contribution
immigrants
make
to
american
society
he
also
marveled
at
the
expertise
and
array
of
languages
spoken
by
the
volunteers
who
are
on
hand
from
9
am
to
7
pm
all
week
i
dont
know
if
i
can
help
you
with
most
of
these
bloomberg
said
looking
at
the
long
list
of
languages
which
included
cantonese
albanian
ibo
and
russian
maybe
here
a
little
he
added
pointing
to
spanish
my
high
school
spanish
is
just
enough
to
get
by
the
number
of
phone
lines
have
been
doubled
this
year
thanks
to
sponsor
verizon
half
are
dedicated
to
spanish
speakers
but
callers
from
russia
korea
china
and
across
europe
can
also
have
their
queries
answered
in
their
mother
tongue
understanding
immigration
is
even
difficult
for
native
american
speakers
so
for
a
person
who
hasnt
lived
in
this
country
a
long
time
and
might
not
feel
comfortable
with
english
its
really
tough
said
euna
park
an
attorney
and
cuny
staff
member
who
works
at
their
flushing
immigration
center
and
speaks
korean
just
to
hear
someone
say
hello
in
your
own
language
makes
you
feel
like
theres
someone
who
can
help
almost
200
volunteers
will
be
on
hand
all
week

answer
immigration
questions
