the

he
would
moderate

tough
policy
on
immigration
enforcement
his
administration
is
pursuing
an
aggressive
strategy
for
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigration
that
relies
significantly
on
programs
started
by
president
george
w
bush
a
recent
blitz
of
measures
has
antagonized
immigrant
groups
and
many
of
mr
obamas
hispanic
supporters
who
have
planned
a
national
campaign
against
the
tactics
including
scattered
street
protests
this
week
the
administration
recently
opened
audits
of
employee
paperwork
at
hundreds
of
businesses
expanded
a
program
to
verify
workers
immigration
status
that
has
been
widely
criticized
as
flawed
expanded
an
immigration
cooperation
program
between
federal
and
local
law
enforcement
authorities
and
rejected
proposals
for
legally
binding
rules
governing
conditions
in
immigration
detention
centers
the
homeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
and
other
administration
officials
argue
that
nononsense
immigration
enforcement
is
necessary
if
american
voters
are
to
be
persuaded
to
accept
legislation
to
give
legal
status
to
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
we
are
expanding
enforcement
but
i
think
in
the
right
way
ms
napolitano
said
in
an
interview
the
approach
moves
mr
obama
toward
the
position
that
his
republican
presidential
rival
senator
john
mccain
of
arizona
espoused
during
the
election
campaign
last
year
which
mr
obama
rejected
as
too
hard
on
latino
and
immigrant
communities
the
enforcement
strategy
has
opened
a
political
rift
between
the
administration
and
some
hispanic
and
immigrant
advocacy
groups
representing
voters
who
were
crucial
to
mr
obamas
victory
our
feelings
are
mixed
at
best
said
clarissa
martinez
de
castro
immigration
director
of
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
national
hispanic
group
that
joined
in
the
criticism
of
ms
napolitano
we
understand
the
need
for
sensible
enforcement
but
that
does
not
mean
expanding
programs
that
often
led
to
civil
rights
violations
under
ms
napolitano
the
immigration
authorities
have
backed
away
from
the
frequent
mass
roundups
of
illegal
immigrants
in
factories
that
took
place
during
the
bush
administration
but
us
criminal
prosecutions
for
immigration
violations
have
increased
this
year
according
to
a
study
by
the
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
a
nonpartisan
group
that
analyzes
government
data
in
april
there
were
9037
immigration
cases
in
the
us
courts
an
increase
of
32
percent
from
the
number
in
april
2008
the
group
found
in
a
recent
speech
at
the
council
on
foreign
relations
in
new
york
ms
napolitano
seemed
to
echo
the
bush
administration
when
she
framed
illegal
immigration
as
a
national
security
threat
citing
the
reality
that
potential
terrorists
could
use
a
variety
of
ways
to
enter
the
country
illegally
fake
documents
visa
overstays
and
even
border
tunnels
she
said
she
would
not
call
off
immigration
raids
entirely
as
representative
luis
v
gutierrez
democrat
of
illinois
and
some
other
hispanic
lawmakers
had
suggested
we
will
continue
to
enforce
the
law
and
to
look
for
effective
ways
to
do
it
ms
napolitano
said
in
the
interview
thats
my
job
but
ms
napolitano
who
sparred
with
republicans
in
the
state
legislature
in
arizona
over
immigration
policy
when
she
was
governor
there
said
she
was
looking
for
ways
to
make
enforcement
programs
inherited
from
the
bush
administration
less
heavyhanded
and
to
focus
them
on
illegal
immigrant
gang
members
and
criminal
convicts
and
on
employers
who
routinely
hire
unauthorized
immigrants
to
exploit
them
ms
napolitano
has
decided
to
expand
a
national
program
everify
that
allows
employers
to
verify
the
documents
of
new
employees
electronically
immigrant
and
business
groups
have
sued
in
federal
court
to
try
to
stop
the
program
saying
the
databases
it
relies
on
are
riddled
with
inaccuracies
that
could
lead
to
denial
of
jobs
to
american
citizens
but
homeland
security
officials
said
technological
improvements
had
improved
the
speed
and
accuracy
