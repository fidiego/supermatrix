while
we
are
a
nation
of
immigrants
our
policies
regarding
immigration
are
dysfunctional
this
is
not
just
because
we
cant
control
our
own
borders
and
enforce
our
immigration
laws
but
also
because
even
our
system
of
legal
immigration
fails
to
reflect
the
needs
of
our
country
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
proposal
must
incorporate
three
essential
elements
it
must
secure
our
borders
and
provide
for
the
effective
enforcement
of
our
immigration
laws
it
must
contribute
to
the
economic
growth
of
our
country
and
it
must
be
compassionate
in
keeping
families
together
first
we
must
secure
our
borders
and
enforce
our
laws
ironically
my
first
overseas
military
assignment
involved
providing
border
security
for
another
country
while
our
own
border
remained
unsecure
ive
been
down
to
our
border
with
mexico
and
im
not
convinced
that
simply
throwing
more
money
at
border
security
will
solve
the
problem
what
is
needed
is
leadership
that
reflects
both
the
will
to
secure
our
borders
and
objective
metrics
evaluated
by
experts
outside
of
the
executive
branch
to
make
that
determination
in
addition
i
dont
think
many
americans
realize
that
40
percent
of
illegal
immigration
is
committed
by
those
who
first
enter
our
country
legally
but
then
overstay
their
visas
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
not
only
provide
for
border
security
but
also
must
help
us
enforce
our
immigration
laws
on
those
who
enter
our
country
on
visas
removing
the
incentives
for
employers
to
hire
people
who
are
in
this
country
illegally
should
be
an
essential
element
of
any
comprehensive
proposal
to
help
enforce
our
laws
employers
must
have
access
and
be
required
to
use
an
electronic
system
such
as
e
verify
where
they
can
quickly
and
accurately
verify
the
legal
status
of
each
job
applicant
employers
should
be
subject
to
stiff
fines
and
criminal
prosecution
should
they
knowingly
hire
workers
in
this
country
illegally
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
meet
the
economic
needs
of
our
country
no
doubt
immigration
policies
should
not
be
used
as
a
tool
to
displace
americans
labor
but
to
complement
it
reform
efforts
should
facilitate
a
more
fluid
and
workable
visa
authorization
system
so
that
temporary
workers
for
both
low
and
highly
skilled
positions
can
obtain
and
renew
work
permits
seasonal
temporary
work
such
as
in
agriculture
needs
a
robust
system
that
allows
the
workers
without
their
families
to
come
into
our
country
when
they
are
needed
and
then
go
home
after
their
seasonal
work
is
done
for
those
on
student
visas
in
technical
fields
critical
to
our
economy
we
should
allow
them
to
stay
and
work
in
the
united
states
after
they
graduate
lastly
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
show
compassion
to
the
families
that
have
been
here
regardless
of
their
immigration
status
many
have
either
children
who
were
born
here
and
are
american
citizens
or
children
who
grew
up
here
went
to
school
here
and
who
know
of
no
other
country
besides
the
united
states
i
believe
that
these
young
people
should
be
afforded
a
pathway
to
citizenship
the
adults
who
knowingly
broke
our
immigration
laws
but
who
have
otherwise
not
violated
any
criminal
laws
should
be
provided
a
temporary
provisional
residency
this
would
constitute
a
probationary
status
that
would
be
rescinded
if
certain
requirements
such
as
criminal
background
checks
paying
taxes
and
independence
from
public
assistance
are
not
met
from
this
status
they
could
apply
to
be
permanent
residents
green
card
but
not
until
all
the
border
security
and
enforcement
requirements
under
a
new
immigration
reform
law
are
certified
to
be
effectively
in
place
by
experts
outside
of
the
executive
branch
there
should
be
no
special
pathway
to
citizenship
after
earning
permanent
resident
status
they
could
apply
for
citizenship
and
should
be
treated
like
any
other
applicant
understanding
that
a
critical
part
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
must
include
the
establishment
of
a
much
higher
standard
for
both
english
proficiency
and
for
demonstrating
an
understanding
of
the
civic
culture
of
our
nation
our
immigration
system
is
badly
broken
and
every
day
that
it
is
allowed
to
continue
constitutes
amnesty
for
those
who
have
violated
our
laws
