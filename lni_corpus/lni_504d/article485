a
federal
advisory
commission
will
soon
recommend
gradually
reducing
legal
immigration
by
onethird
and
reshuffling
visa
priorities
to
speed
up
the
admission
of
spouses
and
young
children
of
legal
aliens
members
of
the
panel
have
said
the
proposals
to
be
presented
to
congress
later
this
month
would
make
the
biggest
changes
in
more
than
40
years
in
policies
governing
the
selection
of
legal
immigrants
the
panels
plan
would
clear
up
a
huge
backlog
of
visa
applications
from
the
immediate
relatives
of
permanent
resident
aliens
but
it
would
also
eliminate
longstanding
visa
preferences
for
siblings
and
adult
children
of
united
states
citizens
making
immigration
more
difficult
for
them
the
ninemember
advisory
panel
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
representative
barbara
jordan
of
texas
will
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
nuclear
family
as
the
basic
unit
of
immigration
members
said
under
the
panels
recommendations
the
immediate
relatives
of
united
states
citizens
spouses
children
under
the
age
of
21
and
parents
would
still
be
allowed
to
immigrate
without
a
waiting
period
or
limits
on
the
number
admitted
each
year
but
panel
members
said
they
would
recommend
eliminating
immigration
preferences
that
have
been
granted
for
decades
to
other
close
relatives
including
the
brothers
sisters
and
adult
children
of
united
states
citizens
in
general
those
relatives
could
not
obtain
visas
to
immigrate
unless
they
qualified
because
of
their
job
skills
the
commissions
proposals
are
likely
to
be
influential
on
capitol
hill
because
congress
created
the
commission
appointed
eight
of
the
nine
members
and
is
seeking
new
ways
to
overcome
deep
disagreements
on
immigration
policy
since
lawmakers
have
not
yet
seen
the
report
there
is
no
way
to
know
how
its
recommendations
will
fare
in
congress
but
it
is
built
on
a
complex
set
of
tradeoffs
intended
to
offer
something
to
all
sides
in
the
immigration
debate
and
it
will
no
doubt
further
appeal
to
many
in
congress
simply
because
the
commission
and
its
report
offer
some
political
cover
on
highly
contentious
issues
many
republican
lawmakers
favor
new
limits
but
some
like
dick
armey
of
texas
the
house
majority
leader
see
immigration
as
an
engine
of
economic
growth
and
oppose
new
restrictions
in
addition
the
recommendations
come
at
a
time
when
many
americans
are
expressing
concern
about
immigration
whether
legal
and
illegal
in
california
last
november
voters
approved
a
ballot
measure
that
would
make
illegal
aliens
ineligible
for
public
education
and
most
social
services
judges
have
delayed
its
enforcement
while
it
faces
legal
challenges
in
addition
the
house
of
representatives
in
march
approved
a
bill
that
would
deny
welfare
food
stamps
and
medicaid
to
legal
aliens
some
members
of
the
immigration
panel
said
they
were
reluctant
to
discuss
its
recommendations
because
they
were
still
editing
the
report
but
some
suggested
that
public
concern
about
illegal
immigration
was
inevitably
influencing
public
attitudes
toward
legal
immigration
one
member
of
the
panel
bruce
a
morrison
a
former
democratic
member
of
congress
from
connecticut
said
current
levels
of
legal
immigration
are
not
a
problem
but
in
the
context
of
substantial
illegal
immigration
there
is
a
problem
lawrence
h
fuchs
a
professor
at
brandeis
university
who
is
vice
chairman
of
the
commission
said
in
the
aggregate
on
balance
immigrants
have
contributed
to
strengthening
the
united
states
he
deplored
what
he
described
as
a
public
fixation
on
numbers
but
added
we
have
to
have
limits
because
of
the
disproportionate
impact
of
immigration
in
some
places
like
los
angeles
at
a
closed
meeting
from
may
23
to
25
commission
members
said
they
affirmed
the
value
of
legal
immigration
but
voted
to
recommend
that
congress
reduce
it
by
onethird
over
the
next
few
years
from
its
average
over
the
last
three
years
of
830000
a
year
in
the
transition
period
700000
immigrants
would
be
admitted
annually
after
the
transition
550000
would
be
admitted
each
year
and
that
would
become
the
normal
level
of
legal
immigration
as
a
corollary
panel
members
said
congress
should
eliminate
the
large
backlog
of
visa
applications
already
filed
on
behalf
of
the
spouses
and
minor
children
of
permanent
resident
aliens
congress
could
do
that
over
three
to
eight
years
they
said
an
immigration
expert
who
worked
with
the
commission
said
both
sides
of
the
equation
are
necessary
reducing
immigration
without
expediting
the
entry
of
immediate
relatives
flies
in
the
face
of
human
nature
it
will
only
increase
illegal
migration
but
expediting
their
entry
requires
the
elimination
of
other
categories
in
order
to
get
the
needed
visa
numbers
susan
martin
executive
director
of
the
commission
said
there
were
11
million
wouldbe
immigrants
on
the
waiting
list
of
spouses
and
minor
children
of
legal
permanent
residents
about
850000
are
relatives
of
illegal
aliens
who
gained
legal
status
under
an
amnesty
program
created
by
congress
in
1986
most
others
are
overseas
relatives
of
recent
legal
immigrants
ms
martin
said
it
would
take
at
least
a
decade
to
work
through
the
backlog
under
current
law
commission
members
said
it
was
not
in
the
national
interest
for
families
to
be
apart
for
so
long
the
panels
major
recommendations
were
approved
by
votes
of
8
to
1
commission
members
said
they
were
surprised
that
they
had
achieved
a
bipartisan
consensus
the
dissenter
was
warren
r
leiden
executive
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
whose
members
represent
legal
and
illegal
aliens
their
relatives
and
employers
this
is
a
shortsighted
proposal
mr
leiden
said
in
an
interview
i
would
support
revising
the
priorities
for
family
immigration
but
cannot
support
the
commissions
proposal
to
eliminate
three
of
the
four
existing
family
preference
categories
i
also
oppose
the
reduction
of
almost
30
percent
in
the
ceiling
for
employmentbased
immigrants
the
commission
recommends
that
the
government
levy
substantial
fees
on
employers
who
want
to
bring
in
foreign
workers
like
computer
scientists
engineers
and
health
professionals
the
fees
are
meant
to
discourage
employers
from
hiring
foreign
workers
when
americans
are
available
employers
willing
to
pay
the
fees
could
import
foreign
workers
faster
than
they
do
now
mr
leiden
criticized
this
proposal
as
a
tax
on
american
businesses
that
use
foreign
workers
he
said
it
would
hinder
access
to
the
skills
needed
to
compete
in
a
global
economy
another
panel
member
harold
w
ezell
a
former
western
regional
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
said
i
believe
immigration
is
good
for
america
but
too
much
of
a
good
thing
can
be
harmful
i
love
certain
types
of
candy
but
if
you
eat
too
much
youll
overdose
on
chocolate
weve
got
to
have

senator
alan
k
simpson
the
wyoming
republican
who
is
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committees
subcommittee
on
immigration
has
proposed
a
25
percent
reduction
in
legal
immigration
over
the
next
five
years
to
provide
a
breathing
space
the
current
flow
of
legal
immigrants
is
more
than
can
be
comfortably
absorbed
he
said
in
september
the
commission
recommended
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
along
the
border
and
at
work
sites
it
said
the
government
should
establish
a
computerized
register
of
the
names
and
social
security
numbers
of
all
citizens
and
legal
aliens
authorized
to
work
in
the
united
states
so
employers
could
verify
the
immigration
status
of
job
applicants
in
february
president
clinton
said
he
wanted
to
test
such
a
system
but
many
civil
liberties
advocate
hispanic
organizations
and
chinese
and
jewish
groups
have
opposed
such
proposals
saying
they
could
increase
job
discrimination
the
argument
that
illegal
immigration
would
undermine
support
for
legal
immigration
upsets
many
immigration
lawyers
in
essence
legal
immigrants
are
being
made
scapegoats
for
the
inability
of
congress
and
the
administration
to
control
illegal
immigration
said
stephen
yaleloehr
who
teaches
immigration
law
at
cornell
law
school
the
proposed
changes
come
just
five
years
after
congress
authorized
increases
in
immigration
for
certain
groups
including
highly
skilled
workers
the
1990
law
more
than
doubled
the
number
of
immigrants
who
could
be
admitted
because
of
job
skills
to
140000
a
year
from
54000
the
jordan
commission
proposes
reducing
the
number
to
100000
on
the
ground
that
no
more
are
needed
commission
members
said
they
would
also
recommend
eliminating
the
annual
allotment
of
10000
visas
for
unskilled
workers
seeking
jobs
in
the
united
states
the
commission
concluded
that
these
immigrants
compete
directly
with
unskilled
american
workers
and
young
people
entering
the
labor
force
in
addition
panel
members
said
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
welfare
recipients
would
soon
be
looking
for
jobs
if
as
expected
congress
imposes
tough
work
requirements
as
part
of
a
bill
to
overhaul
the
welfare
system
many
unskilled
immigrants
work
in
restaurants
and
homecare
jobs
helping
people
who
are
elderly
or
disabled
about
79000
unskilled
workers
are
on
the
waiting
list
in
this
category
the
government
is
now
issuing
visas
to
people
who
have
been
waiting
five
years
