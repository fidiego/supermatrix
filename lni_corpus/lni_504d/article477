raising
serious
doubt
that
congress
will
make
any
meaningful
changes
in
legal
immigration
this
year
the
senate
today
resoundingly
rejected
two
measures
to
reduce
the
number
of
foreigners
entering
this
country
legally
after
six
hours
of
debate
senators
rejected
80
to
20
a
proposal
to
reduce
immigration
by
legal
residents
family
members
by
at
least
10
percent
over
the
next
five
years
the
proposal
would
also
have
effectively
shut
the
door
on
american
citizens
efforts
to
bring
their
adult
children
or
siblings
into
this
country
those
visas
would
instead
have
gone
to
the
spouses
and
young
children
of
permanent
legal
residents
many
of
those
people
are
already
living
in
the
united
states
but
without
proper
papers
though
the
proposal
was
offered
by
senator
alan
k
simpson
the
wyoming
republican
who
is
the
senates
authority
on
immigration
40
republicans
voted
against
it
among
them
was
senator
bob
dole
of
kansas
the
majority
leader
those
republicans
position
reflected
their
strong
agreement
with
the
senate
judiciary
committees
decision
last
month
to
deal
with
legal
and
illegal
immigration
in
separate
bills
mr
simpsons
proposal
was
an
amendment
to
a
bill
intended
to
curb
illegal
immigration
the
bipartisan
vote
against
the
simpson
proposal
also
reflected
strong
support
for
the
position
that
immigrants
who
enter
the
country
legally
serve
as
a
wellspring
of
economic
growth
and
innovation
a
second
amendment
to
the
immigration
bill
offered
by
senator
dianne
feinstein
democrat
of
california
closely
resembled
mr
simpsons
but
would
have
allowed
some
visas
for
adult
and
minor
children
of
legal
residents
it
was
defeated
74
to
26
both
amendments
would
have
limited
family
sponsored
immigration
to
the
current
level
of
480000
people
a
year
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
projects
a
41
percent
increase
in
legal
immigration
this
year
including
family
categories
the
number
declined
10
percent
last
year
to
593000
last
month
the
house
by
a
vote
of
238
to
183
removed
from
its
illegal
immigration
bill
most
provisions
on
legal
immigration
and
then
passed
the
bill
the
senate
appears
likely
to
pass
its
bill
on
illegal
immigration
next
week
with
the
legislative
calendar
running
short
and
senators
now
on
record
against
reducing
legal
immigration
and
certain
family
categories
many
experts
in
immigration
said
that
the
likelihood
of
the
senate
considering
the
separate
bill
on
legal
immigration
might
be
dimming
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
research
group
in
washington
that
favors
reducing
legal
immigration
said
that
the
legalimmigration
bill
technically
is
still
alive
but
that
its
fate
rested
with
mr
doles
clearing
time
on
the
senate
floor
for
debate
todays
debate
over
the
two
amendments
particularly
mr
simpsons
was
as
lopsided
as
the
eventual
vote
on
them
even
with
his
amendment
mr
simpson
argued
we
will
continue
to
have
the
most
open
door
of
any
country
in
the
world
but
senator
after
senator
rose
to
defend
the
nations
history
of
accepting
legal
immigrants
weve
got
room
for
people
who
want
to
come
and
work
said
one
of
them
senator
phil
gramm
republican
of
texas
we
dont
have
room
for
people
who
are
looking
for
a
handout
many
lawmakers
including
republicans
also
objected
to
mr
simpsons
tactics
tacking
this
on
to
the
illegal
immigration
bill
is
the
worst
conceivable
way
to
deal
with
legal
immigration

spencer
