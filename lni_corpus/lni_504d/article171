summit
what
to
expect
president
obama
will
meet
with
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
thursday
to
discuss
the
arizona
immigration
law
but
room
for
compromise
appears
to
be

arizonas
push
for
immigration
reform
is
getting
its
day
at
the
white
house
when
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
signed
sb
1070
on
april
24
the
states
tough
new
immigration
law
requiring
police
to
ask
for
id
from
anyone
they
suspect
of
being
undocumented
she
said
the
bill
was
necessary
to
address
a
situation
we
did
not
create
and
the
federal
government
has
refused
to
fix
the
crisis
caused
by
illegal
immigration
on
arizonas
porous
border
president
obama
responded
days
later
from
the
white
house
rose
garden
with
highlyquoted
remarks
a
failure
to
act
at
the
federal
level
will
only
open
the
door
to
irresponsibility
by
others
that
includes
the
recent
efforts
by
arizona
which
threaten
to
undermine
basic
notions
of
fairness
that
we
cherish
as
americans
now
the
two
are
scheduled
to
meet
thursday
in
washington
and
observers
from
all
sides
will
be
sifting
through
accounts
of
the
encounter
to
decipher
any
hints
of
movement
by
either
side
most
say
tangible
action
from
the
meeting
is
unlikely
it
appears
that
the
chief
objective
of
the
meeting
is
one
that
is
symbolic
in
nature
to
bring
both
sides
of
the
issue
together
at
the
table
says
villanova
assistant
professor
of
political
science
catherine
wilson
it
is
highly
unexpected
that
governor
brewer
and
president
obama
will
change
their
point
of
view
on
the
issue
the
president
will
be
forced
to
walk
the
tightrope
between
two
political
needs
says
jack
pitney
a
political
scientist
at
claremont
mckenna
college
on
the
one
hand
he
has
to
assure
hispanic
supporters
that
he
will
fight
discrimination
and
work
to
reform
immigration
law
he
says
on
the
other
hand
he
also
has
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
serious
about
border
security
and
that
he
understands
the
gravity
of
arizonas
problems
progress
wont
come
from
the
meeting
because
brewer
is
just
in
it
for
politics
argues
immigration
reform
advocate
robert
gittleman
there
is
not
going
to
be
much
accomplished
because
the
governor
is
disingenuously
pushing
for
federal
immigration
reform
brewer
has
been
rattling
cages
from
the
beginning
he
says
blatantly
pandering
to
the
far
right
of
her
base
supporters
of
the
arizona
law
say
they
will
be
watching
for
something
tangible
from
the
administration
the
decision
by
arizona
state
officials
to
enact
sb
1070
was
not
political
maneuvering
says
ira
mehlman
spokesman
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
it
was
a
carefully
thoughtout
response
to
a
crisis
that
is
draining
state
resources
and
endangering
the
security
of
arizonans
mr
mehlman
accuses
the
obama
administration
of
systematically
undermining
immigration
law
enforcement
and
says
the
public
should
be
asking
why
obama
hasnt
exercised
the
authority
he
already
has
the
day
the
arizona
law
was
signed
president
obama
admitted
that
the
federal
government
has
failed
to
address
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
adequately
says
mehlman
he
has
all
the
authority
he
needs
to
enforce
immigration
laws
at
the
border
and
in
the
interior
of
the
country
arizonas
new
law
has
drawn
criticism
from
the
federal
government
and
sparked
rallies
and
economic
boycotts
related
arizona
immigration

to
