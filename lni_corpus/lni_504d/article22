since
the
september
11
terrorist
attacks
there
has
been
increasing
discussion
in
policy
circles
about
integrating
canadian
and
us
labour
markets
such
a
move
would
require
the
harmonization
of
our
immigration
policies
but
since
our
own
immigration
policy
has
served
us
well
in
the
past
and
gives
every
indication
of
doing
so
in
the
future
canada
should
reject
any
move
toward
adopting
us
rules
at
first
glance
the
integration
of
north
american
labour
markets
has
some
appeal
when
economic
conditions
in
the
united
states
improve
relative
to
canadas
labour
would
move
freely
to
take
up
the
us
jobs
and
vice
versa
economic
theory
suggests
this
free
flow
of
labour
is
optimal
for
the
efficient
operation
of
the
two
labour
markets
these
conclusions
fit
well
in
a
pictureperfect
theoretical
world
but
we
live
in
the
real
world
and
the
existence
of
largescale
immigration
into
both
countries
complicates
this
picture
labour
market
integration
would
require
creating
a
single
set
of
rules
governing
the
admission
of
immigrants
to
north
america
without
a
single
set
of
rules
for
example
it
would
be
impossible
for
one
country
to
close
its
borders
to
immigration
since
migrants
would
simply
enter
via
the
other
country
and
move
to
the
one
that
had
shut
its
doors
since
the
second
world
war
the
united
states
has
consistently
admitted
more
than
six
times
as
many
immigrants
as
canada
this
numerical
imbalance
makes
it
likely
that
us
immigration
rules
would
dominate
the
shape
of
any
harmonized
policy
the
question
then
is
would
this
matter
in
answering
this
question
it
is
useful
to
ask
what
if
canada
had
adopted
us
immigration
policy
at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
and
stuck
with
it
since
then
would
such
a
decision
have
made
any
difference
to
canadian
longterm
economic
and
social
development
the
short
answer
is
that
it
would
have
had
substantial
negative
effects
harmonization
would
have
decreased
economic
growth
accentuated
shortterm
fluctuations
in
unemployment
and
limited
our
ability
to
use
immigration
as
a
social
policy
tool
canadian
immigration
policy
since
the
immigration
act
of
1910
has
aimed
to
meet
the
short
and
longrun
economic
needs
of
the
country
for
example
immigration
policy
during
the
opening
decades
of
the
last
century
was
aimed
almost
exclusively
at
populating
the
canadian
west
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
second
world
war
the
country
again
turned
to
immigration
to
meet
the
needs
of
a
rapidly
growing
economy
in
recent
years
immigration
policy
has
concentrated
on
augmenting
the
skill
base
of
the
canadian
labour
force
immigrants
played
a
crucial
role
in
lowering
adjustment
costs
by
moving
into
expanding
sectors
and
out
of
declining
areas
more
rapidly
than
did
their
nativeborn
counterparts
us
immigration
policy
followed
a
very
different
path
the
quota
act
of
1924
lowered
total
annual
inflow
to
about
150000
a
year
essentially
closing
the
door
on
immigration
more
importantly
us
policy
focused
significantly
on
family
reunification
a
policy
that
holds
as
much
today
as
it
did
80
years
ago
in
2002
only
16
of
us
immigrants
were
admitted
for
economic
reasons
compared
to
60
in
canada
this
noneconomic
policy
would
have
imposed
serious
constraints
on
canadian
economic
development
canadian
immigration
policy
is
also
much
more
flexible
than
its
us
counterpart
for
almost
a
century
canada
has
regulated
the
inflow
of
immigrants
on
the
basis
of
shortrun
economic
conditions
when
domestic
unemployment
is
low
the
tap
is
turned
on
and
when
economic
conditions
are
poor
the
tap
is
closed
this
defining
feature
of
canadian
immigration
policy
is
known
as
absorptive
capacity
but
us
immigration
policy
lacks
this
capacity
to
respond
to
shortrun
needs
since
over
the
long
run
it
has
set
low
annual
intake
levels
this
approach
would
not
have
worked
for
canada
as
a
small
open
economy
we
needed
the
flexibility
to
respond
quickly
to
changing
commodity
demands
and
to
technological
change
canadian
immigration
policy
has
been
highly
innovative
over
the
past
century
and
harmonization
would
have
limited
the
concomitant
benefits
the
best
example
is
the
development
of
the
point
system
which
sets
out
objective
measures
age
education
professional
experience
etc
by
which
to
judge
the
admissibility
of
prospective
immigrants
this
has
proved
to
be
a
powerful
economic
policy
tool
to
shift
toward
a
greater
share
of
skilled
workers
the
united
states
has
made
no
move
toward
adopting
any
type
of
policy
that
would
increase
the
share
of
skilled
foreignborn
workers
entering
the
country
as
canada
faces
a
looming
shortage
of
skilled
labour
in
the
next
10
years
the
adoption
of
us
regulations
would
not
be
in
our
longterm
interests
past
experience
shows
canadas
immigration
policy
is
superior
to
its
southern
neighbours
in
terms
of
its
economic
focus
shortterm
flexibility
and
innovative
capacity
as
appealing
as
labour
market
harmonization
may
appear
immigration
accounts
for
60
of
our
current
population
growth
it
is
imperative
that
we
not
surrender
control
over
this
powerful
tool
of
social
and
economic
development
