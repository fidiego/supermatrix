makes

his
1600acre
piece
of
westcentral
texas
and
pronounces
everything
under

his

his

to
be
just
fine
but
west
like
his
pioneering
grandfather
makes
his
main
living
in
the
hardscrabble
oil
fields
nearby
and
hes
seen
this
tiny
town
through
enough
boomandbust
cycles
to
recognize
a
gathering
economic
storm
and
wonder
if
its
time
to
seal
the
border
weve
got
a
lot
of
nice
people
here
and
weve
got
a

of
nice
spanish
people
west
says
casually

with
jobs
in

we
just
dont

any
more
when
west
goes
to
the
polls
in
todays
super
tuesday
presidential
primary
hell
have
his
pick
of
gettough
remedies
republican
candidates
have
been
talking
about
immigration
with
a
forcefulness
that
resonates
even
here
hundreds
of
miles
from
americas
porous
borderlands
but
border
politics
arent
likely
to
reach
full
boil
until
later
this
month
when
the
candidates
reach
california
where
the
heated
debate
promises
to
echo
in
novembers
general
election
and
in
congress
as
lawmakers
consider
the
most
restrictive
immigration
policies
in
30
years
though
frontrunning
bob
dole
is
expected
in
todays
contests
to
make
his
nomination
all
but
a
formality
analysts
say
immigration
will
be
amplified
as
a
campaign
issue
by
the
renegade
candidacy
of
pat
buchanan
buchanans
fence
the
cabletv
pundit
wants
to
build
a
fence
at
the
usmexico
border
to
halt
illegal
immigration
and
shut
down
most
legal
immigration
for
five
years
he
has
tied
the
issue
to
concerns
about
free
trade
declining
wages
crime
and
a
decline
in
social
values
buchanan
is
going
to
hang
in
there
until
the
convention
in
san
diego
and
he
will
continue
to
beat
the
drum
on
immigration
said
calvin
jillson
chairman
of
the
political
science
department
at
southern
methodist
university
doles
need
to
assuage
buchanans
supporters
experts
say
may
have
dramatic
impact
on
what
he
does
as
both
the
gop
nominee
and
as
majority
leader
in
the
senate
where
he
will
have
to
give
his
blessing
to
the
immigration
bill
republicans
hope
to
pass
the
pending
legislation
would
establish
a
pilot
verification
system
in
states
with
many
immigrants
such
as
california
that
would
allow
employers
to
check
the
legal
residency
status
of
potential
workers
opponents
say
that
is
a
first
step
toward
a
national
identification
card
the
legislation
also
would
curb
the
ability
of
us
residents
to
have
their
siblings
and
adult
children
join
them
in
this
country
and
calls
for
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
heres
the
danger
if
a
politician
can
appear
more
moderate
on
immigration
by
appearing
slightly
more
moderate
than
those
who
want
to
dig
ditches
at
the
border
and
erect
fences
that
is
going
to
be
counterproductive
said
robert
rubin
of
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
of
the
san
francisco
bay
area
buchanan
can
push
for
the
great
wall
of
china
at
our
border
and
then
someone
comes
along
talking
about
a
national
id
card
or
denying
due
process
to
immigrants
and
they
sound
tame
by
comparison
here
in
texas
where
trade
with
mexico
was
a
24
billion
business
in
1994
immigration
resonates
only
in
pockets
along
the
border
where
immigrants
are
overwhelming
schools
and
in
the
fields
of
the
flagging
oil
business
where
economic
anxiety
has
taken
over
richard
estrada
a
member
of
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
which
has
called
for
reductions
in
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
and
crackdowns
on
illegal
immigration
said
texas
longstanding
ties
to
mexico
help
distinguish
it
from
the
wrenching
debate
in
california
still
we
have
reached
a
saturation
point
in
places
like
el
paso
where
they
have
had
to
raise
property
taxes
to
deal
with
immigration
and
people
are
resentful
about
it
said
estrada
a
dallas
newspaperman
throbbing
migraine
if
that
resentment
is
an
isolated
ache
in
texas
it
is
a
throbbing
migraine
in
california
where
gov
pete
wilson
used
illegal
immigration
to
propel
himself
to
a
second
term
in
1994
voters
that
year
also
overwhelmingly
approved
a
ballot
initiative
he
championed
proposition
187
which
would
cut
off
public
education
social
services
and
nonemergency
health
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
wilson
doles
california
chairman
continues
to
press
the
immigration
issue
suing
the
federal
government
to
pay
the
costs
of
incarcerating
illegal
immigrants
who
break
the
law
in
california
beating
up
on
latinos
is
good
politics
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
national
immigration
forum
a
proimmigration
group
i
dont
think
immigration
is
going
to
be
a
big
national
issue
this
year
but
its
going
to
be
a
big
issue
in
regions
that
cannot
be
ignored
and
that
means
california
that
means
president
clinton
is
expected
to
continue
to
trumpet
his
moves
to
dramatically
increase
patrols
at
the
border
while
doubling
the
immigration
and
naturalization
services
budget
it
means
dole
who
has
called
for
a
modest
temporary
reduction
in
legal
immigration
and
the
elimination
of
services
to
illegal
immigrants
is
expected
to
trumpet
his
endorsement
of
proposition
187
and
it
means
buchanan
who
has
warned
illegals
are
coming
by
the
millions
will
be
in
fullthroated
battle
cry
as
his
insurgent
campaign
moves
west
support
in
california
the
architects
of
prop
187
most
of
which
has
been
invalidated
in
court
say
support
for
buchanans
message
is
powerful
in
california
pat
buchanan
is
not
simply
a
little
flea
on
the
backside
of
an
elephant
said
bill
ong
hing
an
immigration
law
expert
at
stanford
and
founder
and
director
of
the
immigrant
legal
resource
center
in
san
francisco
and
east
palo
alto
he
has
a
lot
more
credibility
on
this
issue
in
california
than
elsewhere
if
pat
buchanan
wasnt
going
to
be
in
california
maybe
dole
wouldnt
have
to
talk
about
immigration
but
now
he
has
to
some
republicans
worry
buchanans
california
campaign
will
have
the
effect
of
frustrating
legitimate
efforts
to
control
legal
and
illegal
immigration
if
pat
buchanan
gets
to
these
issues
in
california
before
bob
dole
does
he
defines
the
terms
of
the
debate
and
its
no
longer
a
debate
between
illegal
immigration
and
legal
immigration
said
dan
schnur
a
republican
strategist
and
former
wilson
aide
it
becomes
a
debate
about
the
cultural
differences
in
our
society
and
thats
a
much
more
dangerous
debate
to
have
and
a
much
more
difficult
debate
to
win
