immigration
law
has
echoes
of
controversial
federal
act
elements
of
the
arizona
immigration
law
echo
1995s
controversial
section
287g
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
gave
some
local
law
enforcement
officials
the
authority
to
identify
and
detain
immigration
offenders

words
as
critics
assail
arizonas
new
immigration
law
saying
it
is
wrong
to
put
federal
immigration
duties
in
the
hands
of
local
law
enforcement
observers
note
that
the
country
has
been
down
this
road
before
in
1995
the
immigration
and
nationality
acts
section
287g
allowed
us
immigration
officials
to
train
local
law
enforcement
officers
and
authorize
them
to
identity
and
if
necessary
detain
immigration
offenders
the
program
spread
across
the
south
of
the
united
states
from
florida
to
san
bernadino
calif
to
arizona
itself
in
many
ways
287g
has
become
a
litmus
for
the
issues
now
playing
out
in
the
arizona
immigration
law
debate
specifically
the
desire
to
rein
in
illegal
immigration
versus
concerns
about
the
potential
for
abuse
and
racial
profiling
to
proponents
287g
has
been
enormously
successful
to
critics
it
has
harmed
not
served
our
public
safety
it
is
a
microcosm
of
what
has
erupted
from
arizona
during
the
past
month
and
it
points
to
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
middle
ground
in
what
is
an
intensely
polarizing
topic
the
287g
program
has
been
enormously
successful
says
ira
mehlman
media
director
for
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
he
says
the
program
is
used
by
more
than
70
law
enforcement
agencies
in
26
states
and
was
responsible
for
identifying
more
than
160000
removable
aliens
between
january
2006
and
january
2010
others
say
the
287g
partnerships
have
seen
local
law
enforcement
get
carried
away
in
arizonas
maricopa
county
sheriff
joe
arpaio
led
the
largest
287g
operation
in
the
us
says
aarti
shahani
an
immigration
expert
at
new
york
universitys
gallatin
school
he
overstepped
his
bounds
so
profoundly
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
had
to
terminate
his
street
enforcement
powers
she
adds
in
a
2009
report
for
justice
strategies
ms
shahani
concludes
that
the
287g
program
has
failed
it
has
harmed
not
served
our
public
safety
a
chief
concern
of
critics
of
both
287g
and
arizonas
new
law
is
that
such
programs
lead
to
racial
profiling
a
287g
program
run
by
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
called
the
criminal
alien
program
seeks
to
ensure
that
criminal
aliens
serving
time
in
federal
state
or
local
jails
are
not
released
into
the
community
upon
completion
of
their
sentences
notes
a
september
report
by
the
chief
justice
earl
warren
institute
on
race
ethnicity
diversity
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
the
287g
program
tacitly
encourages
local
police
to
arrest
hispanics
for
petty
offenses
the
report
concludes
the
justice
strategies
study
comes
to
similar
conclusions
that
287gs
central
targets
were
traffic
violators
and
day
laborers
suggesting
that
it
was
less
a
crimefighting
tool
then
a
means
of
rounding
up
illegal
immigrants
based
on
ethnicity
the
287g
program
rests
on
a
faulty
assumption
that
the
civil
immigration
mandate
can
be
seamlessly
absorbed
into
the
crimecontrol
mission
shared
by
criminaljustice
agencies
writes
shahani
such
claims
are
unwarranted
says
mr
mehlman
287g
does
not
rely
on
profiling
but
on
training
police
officers
to
identify
people
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
using
the
sort
of
object
information
that
police
use
everyday
to
form
reasonable
suspicion
that
laws
are
being
violated
he
says
in
this
way
observers
say
287g
is
different
from
sb
1070
the
arizona
immigration
law
287g
agreements
provide
training
for
officers
sb
1070
and
287g
laws
are
not
precisely
comparable
says
jessica
vaughan
director
of
policy
studies
at
the
center
for
immigration
studies
287g
agreements
put
officers
through
a
fourweek
training
and
they
get
the
authority
to
arrest
people
for
immigration
violations
sb
1070
simply
has
the
officers
ask
people
about
their
immigration
status
the
287g
laws
were
revamped
in
2009
to
address
concerns
that
individuals
would
be
arrested
for
minor
offenses
as
a
guise
to
initiate
removal
proceedings
