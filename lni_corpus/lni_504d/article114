words
the
recent
us
supreme
court
ruling
upholding
an
arizona
law
imposing
sanctions
on
employers
who
hire
undocumented
workers
and
mandating
the
use
of
the
federal
everify
database
has
drawn
criticisms
from
immigration
lawyers
as
well
as
from
attorneys
for
business
and
civil
rights
groups
who
say
it
creates
a
confusing
landscape
for
employers
what
this
opinion
does
is
open
the
door
to
a
hodgepodge
patchwork
of
50
different
employment
immigration
laws
around
the
country
which
is
very
dangerous
said
david
leopold
president
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
and
principal
of
david
wolfe
leopold
associates
in
cleveland
but
leopold
and
others
were
just
as
quick
to
label
the
ruling
in
chamber
of
commerce
v
whiting
a
narrow
one
brushing
aside
suggestions
that
the
ruling
could
be
a
precursor
to
the
court
reaching
a
similar
conclusion
about
arizonas
other
controversial
immigration
law
sb
1070
which
authorizes
police
to
verify
a
suspects
immigration
status
we
are
talking
about
a
very
limited
application
of
the
federal
immigration
law
leopold
said
whiting
does
not
grant
states
the
right
to
enforce
immigration
law
agreed
linton
joaquin
general
counsel
for
the
washingtonbased
national
immigration
law
center
business
death
penalty
the
2007
law
called
the
legal
arizona
workers
act
subjects
employers
who
knowingly
employ
undocumented
workers
to
penalties
including
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
their
business
licenses
the
law
also
mandates
that
employers
use
the
federal
everify
system
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
workers
federal
law
makes
the
use
of
the
everify
system
voluntary
the
law
referred
to
by
critics
as
a
business
death
penalty
due
to
its
severe
penalties
drew
the
opposition
of
a
motley
coalition
including
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
american
civil
liberties
union
service
employees
international
the
southern
poverty
law
center
and
the
obama
administration
who
challenged
the
law
in
federal
court
arguing
that
it
was
preempted
by
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
that
law
preempts
any
state
or
local
law
imposing
civil
or
criminal
sanctions
other
than
through
licensing
and
similar
laws
upon
those
who
employ
or
recruit
or
refer
for
a
fee
for
employment
unauthorized
aliens
but
the
us
supreme
court
held
in
a
53
ruling
that
the
law
fell
within
the
licensing
and
similar
laws
savings
clause
of
the
federal
statute
and
was
neither
expressly
nor
impliedly
preempted
in
a
statement
issued
after
the
ruling
was
handed
down
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
said
she
was
gratified
despite
the
obama
administrations
opposition
at
the
us
supreme
court
arizona
and
all
states
are
now
free
to
take
down
the
help
wanted
sign
for
illegal
aliens
in
their
states
brewer
said
arizonas
employer
sanctions
law
allows
the
vast
majority
of
businesses
that
want
to
play
by
the
rules
to
comply
with
federal
and
state
laws
against
hiring
illegal
aliens
and
seeks
to
punish
those
employers
who
take
advantage
of
the
federal
governments
immigration
failures
because
of
the
law
brewer
said
arizona
now
leads
the
nation
in
use
of
the
federal
everify
system
by
employers
but
critics
said
the
law
neither
treats
employers
fairly
nor
solves
the
problem
of
employing
illegal
workers
in
fact
in
some
ways
it
makes
the
problem
of
undocumented
workers
worse
because
you
are
just
sending
them
from
one
state
to
another
if
you
have
50
different
laws
leopold
said
that
is
a
very
confusing
situation
for
an
employer
to
do
business
robin
conrad
executive
vice
president
of
the
national
chamber
litigation
center
the
legal
arm
of
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
echoed
those
sentiments
in
a
statement
issued
after
the
ruling
this
ruling
does
not
change
the
reality
that
businesses
from
main
street
to
wall
street
are
overwhelmed
by
a
cacophony
of
conflicting
state
and
local
immigration
legislation
the
growing
patchwork
of
state
and
local
immigration
laws
is
a
serious
obstacle
to
doing
business
across
state
lines
conrad
said
whats
worse
the
ruling
could
spur
states
to
pass
other
immigration
statutes
and
refer
to
them
as
licensing
laws
leopold
said
what
really
disturbs
me
is
if
the
supreme
court
called
this
law
a
licensing
rule
you
could
make
that
argument
for
any
number
of
laws
leopold
said
leasing
and
renting
might
be
seen
the
same
way
leopold
and
conrad
agreed
that
the
only
solution
is
congressional
intervention
its
time
to
put
politics
aside
and
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
leopold
said
in
her
statement
conrad
said
the
decision
makes
it
all
the
more
urgent
for
congress
to
bring
muchneeded
clarity
to
immigration
law
through
legislative
reform
including
preemption
of
employmentrelated
state
immigration
laws
no
blank
check
brewer
said
she
hoped
the
court
would
take
a
similar
approach
to
sb
1070
the
2010
measure
she
signed
into
law
requiring
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
an
individual
who
is
stopped
detained
or
arrested
if
a
reasonable
suspicion
exists
that
the
person
has
entered
the
country
illegally
in
april
the
9th
circuit
upheld
a
preliminary
injunction
preventing
enforcement
of
that
law
and
brewer
vowed
to
appeal
the
ruling
to
the
supreme
court
while
sb
1070
and
the
legal
arizona
workers
act
are
obviously
different
laws
i
am
hopeful
and
optimistic
that
the
us
supreme
court
will
hear
arizonas
future
appeal
of
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
against
sb
1070
and
apply
the
same
general
principle
of
federalism
by
rejecting
claims
of
federal
preemption
brewers
statement
said
i
am
more
adamant
than
ever
that
states
do
have
a
complimentary
role
in
enforcing
federal
immigration
laws
joaquin
vehemently
disagreed
saying
that
unlike
the
whiting
case
sb
1070
did
not
involve
the
application
of
a
federal
savings
clause
the
right
to
enforce
immigration
law
is
the
issue
at
the
heart
of
current
legal
challenges
to
sb
1070
arizonas
racial
profiling
law
joaquin
said
state
legislators
who
consider
whiting
a
free
pass
to
enact
and
implement
legislation
targeting
immigrants
are
gravely
mistaken
conrad
agreed
lets
be
clear
the
decision
does
not
give
states
or
local
governments
a
blank
check
to
pass
any
and
every
immigration
law
she
said
immigration
regulation
continues
to
be
predominantly
a
federal
concern
state
and
local
laws
that
do
not
carefully
and
assiduously
track
federal
law
or
that
merely
masquerade
as
licensing
laws
would
still
be
preempted
