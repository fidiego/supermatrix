people
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
agreed
on
one
thing
at
a
national
conference
monday
federal
inaction
is
behind
state
efforts
to
write
new
immigration
laws
states
and
local
levels
are
legislating
out
of
frustration
and
that
is
about
as
good
as
drunk
dialing
is
for
a
relationship
clarissa
martinez
de
castro
of
the
national
council
of
la
raza
told
journalists
and
students
at
the
heartland
conference
at
the
university
of
oklahoma
dan
stein
president
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
said
his
organization
has
helped
craft
most
of
the
state
laws
that
have
been
debated
recently
including
arizonas
immigration
law
steins
group
has
called
for
tighter
controls
on
immigrants
coming
to
the
us
and
coordination
of
all
government
agencies
to
track
immigrants
theres
a
need
to
have
a
partnership
with
the
executive
branch
to
carry
out
immigration
laws
stein
said
these
state
laws
are
about
trying
to
carve
out
terms
and
put
political
pressure
to
do
more
the
arizona
law
that
went
into
effect
last
year
is
considered
the
toughest
and
most
restrictive
in
the
us
it
is
being
contested
in
federal
court
don
kerwin
of
the
migration
policy
institute
said
there
is
a
risk
of
creating
a
permanent
underclass
in
the
us
and
multitudes
of
scattered
state
laws
are
worse
than
the
status
quo
he
said
the
federal
government
is
deporting
more
than
400000
immigrants
a
year
nationally
its
overstating
it
to
say
the
federal
government
is
not
enforcing
the
laws
kerwin
said
it
is
not
legitimate
to
say
the
federal
government
cant
establish
priorities
state
senators
tackle
the
debate
several
oklahoma
proposals
could
be
rolled
into
house
bill
1446
legislation
that
would
allow
law
enforcement
to
determine
the
legal
status
of
those
they
stop
sen
ralph
shortey
roklahoma
city
campaigned
on
strengthening
immigration
laws
in
oklahoma
and
is
a
member
of
the
joint
committee
on
immigration
one
of
his
bills
would
require
undocumented
students
to
pay
nonresident
tuition
rates
at
state
colleges
and
universities
shortey
said
it
isnt
fair
for
undocumented
students
to
pay
inresident
rates
when
citizen
students
from
other
states
like
texas
cant
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
make
these
people
realize
theyre
not
wanted
here
and
to
leave
our
state
said
shortey
my
native
american
heritage
prompts
me
to
protect
what
we
have
shortey
said
some
american
indians
he
speaks
to
as
well
as
other
constituents
see
they
are
losing
the
country
again
the
freshman
senator
added
he
feels
morally
obligated
to
uphold
and
protect
federal
immigration
laws
recent
census
data
shows
the
hispanic
population
in
the
state
now
tops
the
number
of
american
indians
here
senate
minority
leader
sen
andrew
rice
doklahoma
city
said
he
fears
proposals
like
shorteys
would
alienate
legal
immigrant
communities
and
push
illegal
immigrants
further
underground
this
foments
tension
between
classes
and
races
of
people
and
isnt
a
productive
way
to
address
the
issue
he
said
this
will
affect
our
state
in
ways
we
wont
like
said
rice
who
used
an
example
of
phoenixs
declining
convention
business
because
of
the
states
controversial
immigration
law
that
went
into
effect
last
year
rice
said
immigration
isnt
an
easy
issue
to
tackle
but
the
majority
of
the
immigrants
here
want
to
contribute
and
become
a
part
of
their
communities
oklahoma
values
are
to
do
what
it
takes
to
provide
for
your
family
rice
said
stereotyping
seen
in
issue
martinez
de
castro
said
the
immigration
debate
is
negative
and
often
stereotyped
she
said
seven
of
10
hispanic
people
in
the
us
are
legal
that
jumps
to
nine
out
of
10
among
those
younger
than
18
part
of
the
discussion
of
immigration
is
over
demographic
change
and
cultural
change
and
latinos
are
part
of
that
equation
she
said
panelists
spoke
about
needing
ongoing
evaluations
of
the
labor
market
needs
but
a
couple
warned
of
watching
civil
and
human
rights
our
immigration
laws
are
generous
but
do
they
allow
for
basic
human
rights
kerwin
said
we
are
still
separating
families
after
petitions
are
heard
jerry
kammer
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
said
about
1
million
immigrants
are
granted
residency
status
known
as
green
cards
a
year
he
said
it
was
onefourth
of
that
in
the
1960s
and
half
of
that
in
the
1980s
no
one
is
talking
about
stopping
immigration
kammer
said
it
is
not
antiimmigrant
to
say
maybe
we
should
dial
it
back

glance
