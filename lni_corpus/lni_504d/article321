illegal
immigration
now
costs
arizona
taxpayers
about
13
billion
annually
a
ninefold
increase
in
the
past
decade
according
to
a
new
report
by
the
federation
of
immigration
reform
the
analysis
by
fair
a
group
that
opposes
illegal
immigration
and
supports
moderation
in
legal
immigration
says
the
biggest
increases
have
been
in
expenses
for
educating
providing
health
care
and
jailing
illegal
aliens
that
have
converged
on
arizona
jack
martin
author
of
the
new
fair
report
said
the
real
objective
of
the
study
is
to
inform
arizona
voters
of
efforts
to
place
on
the
november
ballot
a
referendum
to
restrict
the
benefits
available
to
illegal
immigrants
including
health
care
services
and
kindergarten
through
12thgrade
education
those
benefits
are
now
mandated
by
the
federal
government
the
fair
report
the
cost
of
illegal
immigration
to
arizonans
says
the
average
arizona
household
headed
by
a
us
native
bears
more
than
700
a
year
in
additional
costs
because
of
mass
illegal
immigration
to
the
state
arizona
is
second
to
california
in
terms
of
the
size
of
its
illegal
population
and
most
of
the
aliens
come
there
from
mexico
unless
the
federal
government
takes
steps
to
clamp
down
on
the
massive
influx
of
new
illegal
aliens
and
state
officials
begin
cooperating
with
immigration
enforcement
authorities
illegal
immigration
will
do
to
arizona
what
it
has
already
done
to
californias
state
budget
which
is
to
bankrupt
it
mr
martin
said
jeanine
lecuyer
press
secretary
for
arizona
gov
janet
napolitano
a
democrat
said
she
could
not
provide
a
comprehensive
list
of
the
costs
that
state
has
borne
as
a
result
of
illegal
immigration
so
she
could
not
attest
to
the
accuracy
of
fairs
13
billion
figure
we
are
not
aligned
in
any
way
with
that
group
but
we
do
know
that
the
lack
of
responsiveness
by
the
federal
government
to
deal
with
this
problem
has
placed
terrible
pressures
on
our
education
health
care
and
prison
systems
she
said
yesterday
in
a
telephone
interview
officials
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
nonprofit
proimmigration
national
advocacy
group
accuse
fair
of
attacking
illegal
immigration
in
order
to
restrict
legal
immigration
they
say
fairs
new
report
is
clearly
linked
to
its
efforts
to
get
the
antiimmigration
referendum
on
the
arizona
ballot
this
fall
there
is
a
broken
immigration
system
that
needs
to
be
fixed
the
question
is
how
do
you
fix
the
immigration
system
fair
leaders
have
yet
to
provide
an
answer
thats
workable
said
angela
kelley
a
nif
spokeswoman
federal
immigration
officials
estimate
arizonas
illegal
population
is
currently
at
425000
up
from
283000
four
years
ago
in
2000
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
in
california
was
estimated
at
22
million
published
reports
have
said
the
influx
of
such
aliens
to
california
costs
that
state
more
than
4
billion
a
year
and
that
medical
costs
account
for
a
quarter
of
that
