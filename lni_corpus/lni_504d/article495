beginning

immigration
officials
are
stepping
up
enforcement
against
employers
who
knowingly
hire
aliens
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
penalties
against
employers
who
hire
such
aliens
took
effect
when
the
sweeping
immigration
law
was
enacted
in
november
1986
in
the
first
phase
of
enforcement
the
immigration
authorities
familiarized
employers
with
the
law
and
issued
warnings
rather
than
fines
in
most
cases
but
beginning
wednesday
immigration
officials
are
empowered
to
seek
fines
against
employers
the
first
time
they
are
found
hiring
workers
who
are
not
eligible
for
employment
in
the
united
states
the
employer
sanctions
designed
to
curtail
the
availability
of
jobs
that
attract
illegal
workers
across
the
border
are
one
of
the
major
components
of
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
the
law
also
established
an
amnesty
program
that
offered
legal
status
to
several
million
aliens
forces
to
be
increased
immigration
officials
said
the
new
phase
of
enforcement
is
not
intended
to
be
a
crackdown
against
employers
the
mode
of
enforcement
will
not
dramatically
change
said
duke
austin
a
spokesman
for
the
service
however
in
cases
that
are
egregious
willful
and
knowing
we
will
take
action
immediately
to
augment
its
enforcement
efforts
the
immigration
service
is
increasing
from
800
to
1700
the
number
of
immigration
inspectors
the
border
patrol
is
adding
1100
officers
and
is
to
bring
the
total
force
to
4200
officers
by
end
of
the
year
immigration
officials
said
they
would
concentrate
their
enforcement
efforts
in
a
few
key
industries
that
have
historically
employed
ineligible
alien
workers
including
the
construction
garment
hotel
and
service
industries
agricultural
employers
will
not
be
subject
to
the
more
stringent
enforcement
procedures
until
december
of
this
year
the
new
stage
of
enforcement
of
the
law
comes
as
its
critics
contend
it
will
have
a
small
impact
on
illegal
immigration
prompt
some
employers
to
discriminate
against
workers
on
the
basis
of
their
national
origin
or
ethnic
backgrounds
and
create
a
policelike
role
for
businesses
attempting
to
comply
employer
apprehension
representatives
of
business
groups
who
opposed
the
law
said
they
are
awaiting
the
new
phase
of
enforcement
with
apprehension
the
ins
has
been
pretty
responsive
to
employer
concerns
so
far
said
frederick
j
krebs
director
of
the
employee
relations
policy
center
for
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
the
real
test
will
come
after
june
1
and
whether
there
will
be
a
confrontational
approach
or
a
more
responsible
one
for
the
first
violation
an
employer
may
be
fined
between
250
and
2000
for
each
illegal
alien
but
a
repeat
violator
may
be
fined
up
to
10000
per
unauthorized
alien
employers
who
engage
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
violations
also
face
a
prison
sentence
of
up
to
six
months
the
illegal
workers
are
subject
to
deportation
the
law
applies
to
the
estimated
seven
million
employers
in
the
united
states
including
household
employers
who
hire
workers
on
a
regular
basis
immigration
officials
said
that
in
1987
after
the
law
was
enacted
they
detected
a
drop
in
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
apprehended
by
the
authorities
however
the
rate
of
apprehensions
which
is
regarded
as
an
indicator
of
illegal
immigration
remained
largely
unchanged
in
the
first
months
of
this
year
some
critics
of
the
law
interpret
the
statistics
as
a
sign
that
the
law
is
losing
its
deterrent
effect
its
not
going
to
turn
off
the
flow
until
you
address
the
underlying
problems
in
the
sending
countries
said
mario
moreno
associate
counsel
of
the
mexicanamerican
legal
defense
and
education
fund
he
said
that
until
unemployment
and
inflation
in
mexico
and
central
america
decline
youre
not
going
to
see
people
staying
in
their
countries
the
pressures
are
just
to
great
and
the
risks
are
not
that
much
a
special
prosecutors
office
has
been
established
within
the
justice
department
to
investigate
discrimination
cases
under
the
law
but
members
of
congress
concerned
about
the
issue
said
discrimination
has
not
emerged
so
far
as
a
major
problem
