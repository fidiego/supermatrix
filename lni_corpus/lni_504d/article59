during
the
presidential
election
campaign
in
2008
the
expectation
in
washington
was
that
whoever
would
be
elected
as
president
either
democrat
barack
obama
or
republican
john
mccain
the
next
white
house
occupant
would
be
working
together
with
a
bipartisan
congress
to
launch
an
historic
reform
of
us
immigration
policy
after
all
at
that
time
there
seemed
not
to
be
lot
of
ideological
differences
between
the
democratic
and
republican
presidential
candidates
and
their
political
allies
in
capitol
hill
when
it
came
to
the
need
to
come
up
with
solutions
to
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
this
issue
has
dominated
political
debates
for
the
last
two
decades
it
has
been
estimated
that
there
are
between
10
million
to
20
million
illegal
immigrants
from
mexico
and
latin
america
residing
in
the
united
states
surpassing
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
these
people
have
constituted
a
huge
population
flow
that
has
placed
enormous
pressure
on
the
healthcare
and
educational
systems
in
many
states
not
to
mention
the
major
challenge
to
the
legal
system
and
the
police
the
interesting
thing
was
that
until
2008
it
was
the
mr
mccain
who
represents
arizona
a
state
with
a
large
hispanic
population
and
growing
number
of
illegal
immigrants
and
not
the
mr
obama
who
was
playing
a
leading
role
in
congress
in
pressing
for
major
changes
in
the
immigration
policy
this
included
his
efforts
to
craft
with
the
late
liberal
democratic
senator
ted
kennedy
a
law
that
would
have
provided
many
of
the
millions
of
the
illegal
hispanic
immigrants
a
path
to
getting
an
american
citizenship
but
starting
in
2009
something
happened
to
senator
mccain
and
the
entire
republican
party
on
the
road
to
immigration
reform
the
gop
came
under
the
influence
of
the
populist
and
nationalist
wing
of
the
party
represented
by
the
tea
party
movement
tea
partiers
advocated
more
restrictive
policies
on
immigration
and
opposed
mr
mccains
plan
to
allow
illegal
immigrants
to
become
citizens
which
they
denounced
as
an
amnesty
to
those
who
violated
the
law
by
entering
and
staying
illegally
in
the
us
the
antiimmigration
sentiment
became
popular
not
only
in
the
republican
party
but
also
among
many
americans
hit
by
the
financial
crisis
and
rising
unemployment
produced
by
the
great
recession
and
who
feared
that
illegal
and
legal
immigrants
were
stealing
their
jobs
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
opposition
to
immigration
reform
and
in
particular
to
the
amnesty
plan
became
a
central
tenet
of
the
gop
agenda
with
mr
mccain
and
other
moderate
republican
politicians
recognising
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
win
the
support
of
the
partys
activists
especially
during
election
primaries
without
denouncing
even
modest
efforts
towards
immigration
reform
the
result
was
that
the
republicans
in
congress
including
mr
mccain
had
emerged
during
the
first
term
of
mr
obama
as
the
main
obstacle
to
any
proposal
that
could
have
been
perceived
as
an
amnesty
to
the
illegals
indeed
with
the
exception
of
former
utah
governor
jon
huntsman
all
the
republican
presidential
candidates
in
2012
including
the
nominee
former
massachusetts
governor
mitt
romney
rejected
all
the
plans
for
providing
a
path
of
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
including
mr
obamas
proposal
to
grant
citizenship
to
children
of
illegal
immigrants
who
were
born
and
raised
in
the
us
but
then
starting
in
2013
something
happened
to
the
republicans
on
the
road
to
opposing
immigration
reform
that
something
was
the
huge
electoral
loss
of
hispanic
votes
that
the
republicans
suffered
during
the
2012
presidential
and
congressional
elections
indeed
concluding
that
the
growing
electoral
power
of
hispanic
voters
could
determine
the
outcome
of
elections
in
key
states
in
the
coming
years
including
in
traditionally
red
ones
such
as
nevada
colorado
and
perhaps
even
in
texas
and
recognising
that
their
agenda
on
immigration
has
been
responsible
for
antagonising
voters
the
republicans
decided
that
they
needed
to
change
and
to
exhibit
a
more
accommodating
position
on
immigration
reform
with
mr
mccain
and
cubanamerican
senator
marco
rubio
from
florida
leading
the
way
the
republicans
on
capitol
hill
made
it
clear
that
they
were
ready
to
make
a
deal
with
the
white
house
and
the
democrats
on
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
legislation
that
would
include
a
timetable
for
granting
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
in
addition
to
the
consideration
of
electoral
politics
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
immigration
reformers
in
the
gop
has
been
the
improving
economy
that
has
started
to
change
antiimmigration
public
attitudes
in
fact
according
to
gallup
opinion
polls
around
70
per
cent
of
americans
now
support
a
form
of
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants
who
politicians
and
journalists
are
referring
now
to
as
undocumented
immigrants
new
reality
in
addition
the
high
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
us
has
made
the
country
less
attractive
to
potential
immigrants
from
mexico
that
new
reality
together
with
stricter
border
security
has
brought
about
a
decline
in
the
number
of
mexicans
crossing
into
the
us
and
has
helped
make
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
more
manageable
the
endresult
is
that
a
group
of
democratic
and
republican
senators
including
mr
mccain
and
mr
rubio
and
dubbed
by
the
press
as
the
gang
of
eight
is
developing
a
long
844
pages
and
complex
immigration
reform
bill
that
is
bound
to
anger
many
of
the
antiamnesty
republican
activists
and
lawmakers
since
its
expected
to
propose
a
13year
period
for
processing
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
who
would
be
required
among
other
things
to
pay
penalties
and
back
taxes
go
through
a
rigorous
criminal
and
security
checkup
and
pass
a
citizenship
test
but
while
proimmigration
and
hispanic
activists
exude
a
sense
of
optimism
these
days
about
the
chances
that
a
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bill
would
be
approved
during
mr
obamas
second
term
they
concede
that
its
not
a
sure
thing
yet
that
two
immigrants
from
the
caucasus
were
behind
the
recent
terrorism
atrocity
in
boston
has
already
led
a
few
wavering
lawmakers
to
express
some
scepticism
about
the
idea
of
relaxing
immigration
rules
but
what
would
probably
determine
whether
an
immigration
bill
would
finally
get
approved
by
congress
would
be
the
electoral
calculations
of
the
republicans
or
to
put
it
in
more
simple
terms
would
the
republicans
be
more
worried
about
a
potential
backlash
from
hispanic
voters
if
they
reject
the
immigration
plan
or
from
the
partys
antiimmigration
activists
if
they
approve
the
plan
