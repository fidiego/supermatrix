it
all
costa
mesa
resident
john
powelson
a
lifelong
republican
displayed
his
political
sentiments
across
his
chest
at
an
antiillegal
immigration
meeting
last
week
is
john
mccain
the
manchurian
candidate
the
slogan
refers
to
the
1962
film
starring
frank
sinatra
in
which
american
soldiers
are
captured
in
korea
taken
to
china
and
brainwashed
to
become
unwitting
communist
agents
powelson

wonders
if
mccains
policies
on
guns
and
immigration
which
he
sees
as
far
too
liberal
are
the
result
of
a
reallife
manchurian
incident
it
could
very
well
be
that
he
was
brainwashed
he
said
referring
to
mccains
six
years
as
a
prisoner
of
war
in
vietnam
powelson
is
part
of
a
vocal
orange
county
contingent
of
voters
who
see
mccain
and
barack
obama
as
too
soft
on
illegal
immigration
last
year
mccain
cosponsored
a
failed
immigration
package
that
would
have
among
other
things
offered
a
path
to
legal
status
for
immigrants
living
in
the
us
illegally
obamas
position
is
similar
for
many
across
the
country
who
see
illegal
immigration
as
a
critical
campaign
issue
neither
major
party
candidate
fits
the
bill
as
a
result
some
voters
will
be
boycotting
the
presidential
election
others
will
choose
libertarian
bob
barr
or
republican
ron
paul
even
though
paul
has
dropped
out
of
the
election
still
others
may
vote
for
chuck
baldwin
the
american
independent
party
candidate
but
louis
desipio
chairman
of
chicano
and
latino
studies
at
uc
irvine
says
immigration
isnt
as
important
to
voters
as
activists
say
if
you
look
at
public
opinion
polls
immigration
is
rarely
at
the
top
of
list
desipio
said
for
a
core
of
the
republican
party
maybe
10
to
15
percent
its
a
core
issue
economic
issues
national
security
personal
and
public
safety
issues
are
usually
much
higher
last
week
american
independent
candidate
baldwin
a
baptist
minister
from
pensacola
fla
spoke
to
a
receptive
crowd
at
a
california
coalition
for
immigration
reform
meeting
in
garden
grove
in
1994
the
huntington
beachbased
coalition
sponsored
prop
187
which
would
have
denied
illegal
immigrants
health
care
social
services
and
public
education
it
passed
but
was
overturned
by
a
federal
court
even
after
baldwins
fiery
speech
local
voters
who
favor
tougher
enforcement
of
immigration
law
doubt
that
any
of
the
thirdparty
candidates
will
make
it
to
the
white
house
we
know
theyre
not
going
to
win
unless
a
miracle
happens
said
chelene
nightingale
who
runs
save
our
state
an
antiillegal
immigration
group
based
in
orange
county
she
predicts
obama
will
win
instead
of
the
presidential
contest
groups
that
fight
illegal
immigration
are
focusing
on
races
for
state
and
federal
legislative
seats
quite
frankly
thats
where
the
voting
happens
anyway
nightingale
said
there
isnt
much
that
a
president
can
do
orange
countys
antiillegal
immigration
voters
hope
that
santa
ana
school
board
member
rosemarie
avila
will
defeat
rep
loretta
sanchez
a
democrat
in
the
47th
congressional
district
and
that
rep
dana
rohrabacher
a
republican
will
fend
off
huntington
beach
mayor
debbie
cook
to
hold
onto
his
46th
congressional
district
seat
in
los
angeles
immigration
hardliners
are
supporting
republican
ted
hayes
who
is
seeking
to
unseat
veteran
35th
district
rep
maxine
waters
a
democrat
the
focus
on
local
and
state
races
is
a
national
trend
according
to
william
gheen
president
of
americans
for
legal
immigration
a
political
action
committee
states
can
enforce
federal
immigration
policies
and
congressional
candidates
are
seen
as
necessary
to
fight
the
kind
of
sweeping
change
that
mccain
and
obama
would
like
states
cracked
down
on
illegal
immigration
in
the
first
three
months
of
2008
44
states
considered
1106
bills
according
to
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
groups
such
as
gheens
have
lobbied
for
state
legislative
packages
to
empower
police
to
enforce
federal
immigration
law
as
well
as
measures
to
cut
off
social
services
college
access
and
drivers
licenses
for
workers
here
illegally
and
require
businesses
to
verify
immigration
status
of
their
employees
components
of
these
policies
have
been
adopted
in
arizona
oklahoma
south
carolina
utah
and
georgia
were
hoping
to
see
a
political
meltdown
in
november
gheen
said
unless
you
know
strongly
that
your
incumbent
is
not
like
mccain
or
obama
on
immigration
throw

an
organization
that
rates
politicians
on
antiillegal
immigration
policies
cites
the
recent
ouster
of
rep
chris
cannon
rutah
who
lost
to
a
rookie
who
was
tougher
on
immigration
as
evidence
that
voters
want
to
see
immigration
law
enforced
cannons
loss
was
an
outburst
