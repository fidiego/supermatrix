two
refugees
from
central
america
say
they
fear
for
their
lives
after
being
accidentally
turned
away
by
a
canadian
customs
officer
at
the
manitoba
border
one
is
already
carrying
three
bullets
in
his
body
as
a
result
of
a
shooting
in
el
salvador
according
to
a
north
dakota
priest
who
tried
to
bring
the
refugees
into
canada
the
two
refugees
were
taken
into
custody
by
us
authorities
after
they
were
turned
back
one
is
from
el
salvador
the
other
from
guatemala
a
federal
immigration
official
has
acknowledged
that
the
customs
officer
made
an
error
in
that
canadian
policy
requires
all
salvadorean
refugees
to
be
permitted
to
enter
the
country
in
manitoba
only
one
of
the
14
border
posts
is
manned
by
an
immigration
official
at
the
remaining
13
customs
officers
handle
immigration
matters
customs
officers
are
not
fully
trained
in
immigration
winnipeg
immigration
lawyer
david
matas
said
yesterday
theyre
not
familiar
with
the
exceptions
that
relate
to
specific
countries
manitobas
acting
immigration
director
larry
baillargeon
said
the
customs
officer
at
the
small
manitoba
town
of
windygates
was
supposed
to
telephone
an
immigration
official
before
deciding
whether
to
allow
the
refugees
into
canada
but
the
immigration
official
was
not
consulted
until
after
the
refugees
had
been
turned
away
this
was
simply
an
error
by
a
young
man
on
duty
mr
baillargeon
said
weve
confirmed
that
this
wont
happen
again
rev
richard
sinner
a
priest
in
fargo
nd
said
the
refugees
were
detained
for
several
hours
by
the
us
immigration
authorities
they
were
eventually
released
but
they
were
told
to
appear
at
an
immigration
hearing
that
could
decide
to
deport
them
to
central
america
one
of
the
two
rolando
enrique
galvez
of
el
salvador
was
shot
by
the
salvadorean
military
four
years
ago
when
he
tried
to
leave
the
military
rev
sinner
said
and
a
doctor
in
fargo
recently
removed
one
of
the
bullets
from
his
body
the
refugees
father
and
brother
were
killed
by
the
salvadorean
military
rev
sinner
added
the
other
refugee
is
carlos
enriquez
mungia
of
guatemala
rev
sinner
drove
both
refugees
to
the
manitoba
border
a
week
ago
he
had
brought
a
family
of
seven
central
american
refugees
into
canada
by
the
same
route
last
summer
the
customs
officer
at
windygates
should
have
realized
that
the
refugees
would
be
detained
by
the
us
authorities
if
they
were
turned
away
at
the
canadian
border
rev
sinner
said
rev
sinner
said
a
mennonite
group
from
morden
man
had
agreed
to
look
after
the
refugees
the
group
was
waiting
at
the
border
post
when
the
refugees
were
turned
away
i
felt
so
badly
he
said
i
was
just
so
discouraged
there
should
not
have
been
any
problem
federal
immigration
policy
requires
that
salvadorean
refugees
not
be
turned
away
at
the
canadian
border
unless
immigration
officials
have
obtained
an
assurance
from
us
authorities
the
refugees
will
allowed
to
return
to
canada
mr
baillargeon
said
the
customs
officers
are
given
a
fiveday
training
course
in
immigration
matters
they
also
have
a
small
manual
summarizing
canadas
customs
and
immigration
policies
mr
matas
said
this
is
just
not
good
enough
he
noted
that
canada
has
seen
an
influx
of
central
american
refugees
in
recent
months
after
a
change
in
us
employment
laws
because
of
this
the
immigration
department
should
have
sent
instructions
to
every
customs
officer
to
alert
them
of
department
policy
mr
matas
said
mr
baillargeon
said
the
customs
officers
do
not
have
the
full
five
volume
canadian
immigration
manual
because
immigration
is
a
minor
part
of
their
business
mr
baillargeon
said
he
expects
the
refugees
to
be
admitted
to
canada
within
the
next
few
days
however
rev
sinner
said
he
is
afraid
to
drive
the
refugees
to
the
manitoba
border
again
because
he
believes
he
could
be
prosecuted
by
us
authorities
if
he
is
caught
if
they
catch
me
on
the
road
now
theyll
throw
the
book
at
me
he
said
he
noted
that
a
us
district
attorney
in
fargo
has
already
mentioned
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
him
for
harboring
illegal
aliens
