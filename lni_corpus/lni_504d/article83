washington
two
senators
on
opposite
sides
of
the
aisle
are
proposing
comprehensive
changes
to
the
immigration
laws
that
would
include
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
the
estimated
11
million
illegal
immigrants
now
in
the
united
states
democrat
chuck
schumer
of
new
york
and
republican
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
who
promoted
similar
proposals
on
separate
sunday
news
shows
said
that
no
path
to
citizenship
would
be
available
until
the
countrys
borders
were
secure
only
then
could
those
in
the
us
without
authorization
come
out
of
the
shadows
get
biometrically
identified
start
paying
taxes
pay
a
fine
for
the
law
they
broke
graham
told
cbs
face
the
nation
they
cant
stay
unless
they
learn
our
language
and
they
have
to
get
in
the
back
of
line
before
they
become
citizens
they
cant
cut
in
front
of
the
line
regarding
people
who
are
doing
it
right
and
it
can
take
over
a
decade
to
get
their
green
card
schumer
told
nbcs
meet
the
press
that
he
and
graham
have
resumed
talks
on
immigration
policy
that
broke
off
two
years
ago
and
have
put
together
a
comprehensive
detailed
blueprint
on
immigration
reform
that
has
the
real
potential
for
bipartisan
support
based
on
the
theory
that
most
americans
are
for
legal
immigration
but
very
much
against
illegal
immigration
the
associated
press
immigration
policy
largely
ignored
during
president
obamas
first
four
years
in
office
has
reemerged
as
a
major
issue
as
republicans
seek
ways
to
rebound
from
their
election
performance
more
than
70
percent
of
hispanic
voters
supported
obama
who
has
been
more
open
than
republicans
to
comprehensive
overhaul
of
immigration
laws
three
days
after
tuesdays
election
house
speaker
john
boehner
rohio
said
it
was
time
to
address
immigration
policy
he
urged
obama
to
take
the
lead
in
coming
up
with
a
plan
that
would
look
at
both
improved
enforcement
of
immigration
law
and
the
future
of
the
estimated
11
million
people
living
in
the
country
illegally
boehner
however
did
not
commit
to
the
citizenship
issue
graham
said
that
the
tone
and
rhetoric
republicans
used
in
the
immigration
debate
of
2006
and
2007
has
built
a
wall
between
the
republican
party
and
hispanic
community
causing
hispanic
support
to
dwindle
from
44
percent
in
2004
to
27
percent
in
2012
this
is
an
odd
formula
for
a
party
to
adopt
the
fastest
growing
demographic
in
the
country
and
were
losing
votes
every
election
its
one
thing
to
shoot
yourself
in
the
foot
just
dont
reload
the
gun
i
intend
not
to
reload
this
gun
when
it
comes
to
hispanics
i
intend
to
tear
this
wall
down
and
pass
an
immigration
reform
bill
thats
an
american
solution
to
an
american
problem
he
said
both
senators
said
the
overhaul
would
include
developing
a
secure
document
to
assure
employers
theyre
hiring
people
authorized
to
work
in
the
country
and
allowing
legal
immigration
for
needed
workers
at
all
skill
levels
the
path
to
citizenship
would
require
immigrants
to
learn
english
go
to
the
back
of
the
citizenship
line
have
a
job
and
not
commit
crimes
graham
said
the
overhaul
would
have
to
be
done
in
such
a
way
that
we
dont
have
a
third
wave
of
illegal
immigration
20
years
from
now
thats
what
americans
want
they
want
more
legal
immigration
and
they
want
to
fix
illegal
immigration
once
and
for
all
in
exit
polls
on
tuesday
the
associated
press
found
65
percent
favored
offering
most
illegal
immigrants
workers
in
the
united
states
a
chance
to
apply
for
legal
status
more
than
double
the
number
who
said
most
should
be
deported
even
among
republicans
the
party
associated
with
crackdowns
on
illegal
immigration
about
half
favored
a
path
toward
staying
in
the
us
