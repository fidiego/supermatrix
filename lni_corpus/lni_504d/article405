president
clintons
request
for
a
1
billion
jump
in
immigrationrelated
spending
even
as
he
cuts
billions
in
his
1996
budget
reflects
growing
competition
between
the
white
house
and
congress
to
get
tough
on
illegal
immigration
theres
a
madcap
dash
on
to
see
who
can
come
up
with
the
most
aggressive
border
strategy
says
dan
stein
head
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
a
prorestrictions
group
at
stake
control
of
us
borders
and
of
volatile
public
opinion
in
key
states
california
florida
and
texas
in
1996
presidential
elections
the
gop
in
congress
will
try
to
outdo
whatever
the
administration
proposes
to
stay
in
charge
of
issue
says
stein
but
administration
officials
make
a
strong
case
that
no
president
has
paid
as
much
attention
to
border
issues
while
most
of
the
talk
was
about
cutting
the
budget
there
are
some
things
we
should
spend
more
money
on
says
clinton
who
held
a
white
house
ceremony
tuesday
to
spotlight
antiillegal
immigration
efforts
we
are
doing
more
to
stem
the
flow
of
illegal
immigration
than
has
any
previous
administration
today

arrive
in
nogales
ariz
to
bolster
efforts
to
stem
the
illegal
border
crossings
under
clintons
proposed
1996
budget
released
monday
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
alone
will
get
a
528
million
increase
to
26
billion
thats
a
24
increase
over
1995
spending
itself
25
higher
than
1994
and
millions
more
will
go
to
other
federal
agencies
for
enhanced
border
control
worksite
enforcement
faster
deportation
of
aliens
and
cash
to
states
to
help
pay
for
the
costs
of
illegal
immigration
clintons
program
includes
700
new
border
patrol
agents
bringing
the
total
to
5600
by
the
end
of
1996
controversial
pilot
projects
to
test
a
national
registry
to
verify
work
eligibility
tripling
deportations
especially
of
criminal
aliens
to
more
than
110000
per
year
a
new
bordercrossing
fee
of
150
per
pedestrian
and
3
per
vehicle
clinton
stressed
many
of
the
proposals
were
recommended
last
year
by
the
bipartisan
national
commission
on
immigration
reform
lawrence
fuchs
an
immigration
scholar
and
commission
member
says
clintons
program
is
driven
by
necessity
not
politics
ive
been
waiting
15
years
for
some
administration
to
do
what
hes
now
proposing
fuchs
says
i
look
at
the
action
and
im
not
as
concerned
about
motivation
republicans
are
likely
to
rally
behind
a
more
restrictive
bill
introduced
by
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
head
of
the
immigration
subcommittee
but
gop
consensus
may
fall
apart
on
the
bordercrossing
fee
and
the
national
registry
idea
which
critics
condemn
as
unworkable
too
expensive
and
a
threat
to
civil
liberties
