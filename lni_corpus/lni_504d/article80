deportations
of
illegal
immigrants
in
2012
reach
new
us
record
the
obama
administration
deported
at
least
400000
illegal
immigrants
in
fiscal
year
2012
a
new
record
it
emphasizes
deporting
criminal
aliens
to
protect
public
safety
but
the
high
figure
serves
to
remind
latinos
of
the
presidents
unfilled
pledge
to
reform

immigration
and

enforcement
ice
reports
the
record
number
released
friday
is
also
important
for
another
reason
it
is
a
stinging
reminder
to
latinos
that
president
obama
failed
during
his
first
term
to
pursue
the
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
they
seek
the
obama
administration
framed
its
2012
work
in
immigration
enforcement
as
focused
mainly
on
criminals
55
percent
of
deportations
came
from
convicted
criminals
a
record
high
rather
than
on
indiscriminately
rounding
up
illegal
immigrants
and
sending
them
home
ice
on
friday
also
issued
new
detention
guidelines
intended
to
emphasize
legal
action
against
those
who
have
committed
crimes
above
and
beyond
immigration
violations
while
the
fiscal
year
2012
removals
indicate
that
we
continue
to
make
progress
in
focusing
resources
on
criminal
and
priority
aliens
we
are
constantly
looking
for
ways
to
ensure
that
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
utilize
our
resources
in
a
way
that
maximizes
public
safety

director
john
morton
said
in
a
statement
in
four
years
the
obama
administration
has
deported
threequarters
of
the
number
of
people
that
president
george
w
bushs
administration
did
in
eight
and
unlike
mr
bush
obama
made
no
concerted
effort
to
reform
the
us
immigration
system
a
history
thats
not
lost
on
the
presidents
latino
supporters
this
is
nothing
to
be
proud
of
said
rep
luis
gutierrez
d
of
illinois
a
leading
lawmaker
on
immigration
reform
for
a
decade
in
a
statement
on
the
deportation
statistics
while
representative
gutierrez
lauded
the
crackdown
on
criminals
as
necessary
he
said
some
90000
undocumented
parents
of
americanborn
children
continue
to
be
deported
each
year
we
must
also
realize
that
among
these
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deportations
are
parents
and
breadwinners
and
heads
of
american
families
that
are
assets
to
american
communities
and
have
committed
no
crimes
the
gutierrez
statement
said
solving
this
problem
in
a
humane
and
sensible
way
requires
congress
to
act
on
immigration
reform
and
do
what
we
have
been
unable
to
do
for
25
or
30
years
the
closest
the
obama
administration
came
to
reshaping
immigration
policy
was
the
summer
2012
implementation
of
the
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
daca
program
whereby
some
young
unauthorized
immigrants
could
gain
a
twoyear
deferral
of
deportation
and
access
to
work
permits
and
drivers
licenses
some
355000
people
have
applied
under
the
program
and
just
over
100000
have
been
approved
through
middecember
according
to
the
latest
data
from
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
as
many
as
17
million
undocumented
immigrants
could
be
eligible
for
the
program
over
time
experts
say
while
immigration
advocates
cheered
the
presidents
daca
order
they
also
remember
his
unfulfilled
promise
at
the
start
of
his
term
in
2009
to
take
on
immigration
reform
as
well
as
the
record
number
of
deportations
under
his
watch
the
credibility
of
the
president
is
on
the
line
says
ali
noorani
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
the
president
has
to
lead
the
president
has
to
show
republicans
and
democrats
that
hes
serious
about
this
and
that
hes
not
just
going
to
use
it
as
a
political
lightning
rod
obama
has
promised
to
tackle
immigration
reform
early
in
2013
and
congressional
discussions
about
potential
legislation
are
under
way
between
lawmakers
from
both
parties
in
the
house
and
senate
if
obama
doesnt
republicans
will
be
eager
to
point
out
that
democrats
once
again
broke
their
promises
to
some
of
the
lefts
key
voting
blocs
i
just
want
to
remind
all
of
you
though
that
the
democrats
had
two
years
to
do
something
about
immigration
reform
said
rep
raul
labrador
r
of
idaho
after
a
vote
on
a
gopled
bill
that
would
havewould
have
didnt
that
pass
killed

in
favor
of
more
visas
for
highly
educated

in

fields
they
had
a
white
house
they
had
the
house
they
had
the
senate
and
they
did
nothing
about
immigration
reform
he
said
and
that
could
make
latino
and
asian
voters
who
sided
overwhelmingly
with
democrats
in
the
2012
election
susceptible
to
republican
overtures
in
the
future
everybody
talks
about
the
incredible
turnout
of
the
new
american
vote
in
2012
but
latinos
asians
and
other
voters
are
not
diehard
democrats
mr
noorani
says
theres
a
lot
of
space
there
for
republicans
to
step
into
until
obama
and
reformminded
members
of
congress
make
good
on
their
vows
that
2013
will
yield
a
comprehensive
fix
to
americas
immigration
system
however
latino
asian
and
other
proimmigration
forces
will
continue
to
feel
uneasy
about
the
high
level
of
deportations
under
a
democratic
president
we
are
the
one
