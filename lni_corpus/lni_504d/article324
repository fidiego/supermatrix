words
   the
government
is
considering
gathering
biological
information
such
as
fingerprints
and
iris
photographs
from
foreigners
beginning
in
2007
to
reduce
entry
and
departure
time
to
and
from
the
country
officials
said
on
thursday
the
plan
is
to
establish
a
bio
immigration
management
system
in
which
foreigners
would
leave
fingerprints
and
iris
photos
at
their
will
to
the
immigration
office
to
speed
up
the
immigration
procedure
the
officials
said
the
policy
is
to
improve
our
service
at
airports
for
foreigners
who
visit
the
country
very
often
a
researcher
of
the
immigration
bureaus
immigration
policydeveloping
team
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
records
of
biological
information
such
as
fingerprints
and
iris
photgraphs
will
be
converted
into
smart
cards
scanners
to
be
installed
at
immigration
desks
at
airports
will
read
the
cards
when
travelers
go
through
the
immigration
procedurethe
officials
stressed
the
cards
will
be
issued
to
only
those
who
want
the
quick
immigration
service
but
the
question
is
who
is
going
to
willingly
leave
crucial
information
with
a
foreign
government
that
could
lead
to
serious
crimesthe
official
said
the
new
immigration
system
is
for
the
convenience
of
foreign
travelers
and
basically
different
from
the
immigration
policy
of
the
united
states
which
has
been
taking
photos
and
fingerprints
of
travelers
from
nonvisa
exemption
countries
from
early
this
year
citing
danger
of
terrorism
the
south
korean
governments
plan
comes
amid
global
controversy
over
the
us
governments
new
immigration
policy
last
week
the
us
government
caused
a
global
uproar
by
saying
that
it
will
gather
biological
information
from
all
countries
including
those
it
signed
visa
exemption
pacts
with
from
september
30
local
immigration
officials
dismissed
worries
that
the
policy
may
violate
human
rights
because
the
smart
card
is
very
similar
to
the
vip
card
that
many
countries
such
as
singapore
issue
to
selected
foreign
visitors
to
provide
quick
immigration
service
officials
from
the
justice
ministry
and
immigration
bureau
said
the
technology
is
expected
to
take
more
than
a
couple
of
years
to
implement
because
no
local
companies
are
not
yet
up
for
it
they
said
the
immigration
office
will
gather
opinions
from
civic
groups
and
airport
officials
to
set
the
details
for
the
policy
