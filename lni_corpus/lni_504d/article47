scores
of

on
both
sides

to
rally
their
causes
about
two
dozen
immigration
reform
advocates
from
the

coalition
are
asking
rep
gary
miller
rrancho
cucamonga
to
support
legislation

allow
a
path
for
citizenship
for
11
million
undocumented
citizens
im
here
in
support
of
a
new
law

does
not
answer
the
needs
of
the
people

auxiliary
bishop
rutilio
del

who
came
on
behalf
of
the
diocese
in
support
of
immigration
reform
we
need
a
new
law
on
immigration
that
is
comprehensive
not
piece
by
piece
and
includes
the
path
to
citizenship
and
contributes
to
the
unity
of
families

had
a
petition
signed
by
nearly
700
in
san
bernardino
county
to
show
the
congressman
how
much
the
folks
in
his
district
support
immigration
reform
theres
too
many
people
living
in
the
shadows
and
its
time
for
people
to
participate
fully
in
a
society
that
theyve
been
a
part
of
for
a
number
of
years

americans
chris
marsh
district
director
for
miller
said
the
congressman
agrees
the
system
is
badly
broken
in
need
of
fixing
but
is
focusing
on
two
priorities
right
now
as
far
as
the
immigration
debate
goes
marsh
said
millers
priorities
are
making
sure
american
jobs
are
preserved
for
american
workers
and
to
strengthen
the
nations
borders
and
coastlines
once
those
priorities
are
met
we
can
discuss
all
other
aspects
of
the
immigration
debate
