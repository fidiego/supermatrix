the
us
supreme
court
ruling
on
monday
blocking
key
provisions
of
the
controversial
arizona
immigration
law
justly
affirmed
the
federal
governments
unassailable
right
to
set
immigration
policy
for
the
country
arizona
and
a
growing
number
of
states
in
the
last
several
years
have
been
writing
their
own
immigration
laws
in
the
wake
they
say
of
the
federal
governments
refusal
to
curtail
illegal
immigration
and
its
often
adverse
social
and
economic
impacts
on
some
states
particularly
border
states
like
arizona
the
arizona
law
reviewed
by
the
high
court
required
that
all
immigrants
obtain
or
carry
immigration
registration
papers
made
it
a
crime
for
illegal
immigrants
to
seek
or
hold
a
job
and
empowered
police
to
arrest
suspected
illegal
immigrants
without
warrants
and
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
stopped
arrested
or
detained
on
some
other
legitimate
basis
if
the
officer
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
the
person
was
in
the
country
illegally
the
court
struck
down
all
but
the
provision
allowing
police
to
demand
papers
from
anyone
they
stop
arrest
or
detain
although
the
ruling
was
largely
viewed
by
some
as
a
victory
in
affirming
the
rule
of
law
on
immigration
policy
opponents
of
the
arizona
law
are
afraid
that
the
provision
left
standing
will
have
a
chilling
impact
on
the
lives
of
arizona
latino
residents
even
if
they
are
here
legally
it
sent
a
mixed
message
said
eva
millona
executive
director
of
the
massachusetts
immigrant
and
refugee
advocacy
coalition
it
did
not
go
far
enough
in
protecting
arizona
residents
by
upholding
this
controversial
and
problematic
provision
the
court
is
inviting
racial
profiling
she
said
justice
anthony
kennedy
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
acknowledged
the
potential
for
such
an
outcome
and
noted
that
this
would
raise
constitutional
concerns
he
however
concluded
that
it
would
be
premature
for
justices
to
assume
such
an
outcome
it
is
not
clear
at
this
stage
and
on
this
record
that
the
arizona
law
in
practice
will
require
state
officers
to
delay
the
release
of
detainees
for
no
reason
other
than
to
verify
their
immigration
status
he
wrote
but
perhaps
the
deeper
concern
from
this
ruling
should
be
the
realization
that
while
the
court
has
upheld
the
federal
governments
ascendancy
in
setting
immigration
policy
there
is
still
no
solution
in
sight
since
congress
continues
to
find
reasons
not
to
act
speaking
at
the
annual
conference
of
the
national
association
of
latino
elected
and
appointed
officials
on
june
22
president
barack
obama
who
has
long
embraced
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
policy
with
some
form
of
amnesty
and
a
path
to
citizenship
for
many
who
are
here
illegally
spoke
about
the
current
stalemate
on
immigration
reform
the
problem
is
not
the
lack
of
technical
solutions
he
said
we
know
what
the
solutions
are
to
this
challenge
just
six
years
ago
an
unlikely
trio
john
mccain
ted
kennedy
president
bush
came
together
to
champion
comprehensive
immigration
reform
i
along
with
a
lot
of
democrats
were
proud
to
join
23
senate
republicans
in
voting
for
it
today
those
same
republicans
have
been
driven
away
from
the
table
by
a
small
faction
of
their
own
party
its
created
the
same
kind
of
stalemate
on
immigration
reform
that
were
seeing
on
a
whole
range
of
other
economic
issues
he
said
this
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
countrys
immigration
problems
as
well
as
its
economic
and
a
host
of
other
challenges
have
mostly
been
reduced
to
partisan
political
maneuverings
that
while
benefiting
the
designs
of
a
few
have
been
wholly
detrimental
to
the
country
as
a
whole
