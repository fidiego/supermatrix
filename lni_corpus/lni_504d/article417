president
clinton
asked
congress
tuesday
for
1725
million
and
more
tools
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
his
plan
would
double
penalties
against
smugglers
to
10
years
use
wiretapping
and
racketeering
laws
against
them
add
up
to
600
more
border
patrol
agents
allow
officers
to
immediately
turn
away
asylum
seekers
if
their
claim
lacks
credibility
the
asylum
review
process
now
takes
years
we
must
say
no
to
illegal
immigration
so
we
can
continue
to
say
yes
to
legal
immigration
clinton
said
the
proposed
bill
was
hailed
by
a
bipartisan
chorus
in
congress
suggesting
easy
passage
its
an
excellent
first
step
said
sen
alfonse
damato
rny
it
contains
virtually
everything
ive
called
for
said
sen
dianne
feinstein
dcalif
but
advocates
for
immigrants
call
the
plan
political
its
a
cavalier
kneejerk
response
said
margie
mchugh
of
the
new
york
immigration
coalition
there
will
be
more
due
process
for
people
protesting
parking
tickets
than
for
people
fleeing
rape
in
bosnia
but
the
immigration
bill
looks
like
a
quick
bipartisan
winner
on
capitol
hill
i
cant
imagine
that
it
wont
pass
was
the
glum
assessment
of
warren
leiden
director
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
which
would
like
to
see
it
killed
or
amended
polls
indicate
the
public
is
demanding
a
new
hardline
attitude
against
smugglers
of
illegal
immigrants
and
people
who
abuse
the
asylum
system
clintons
proposal
alludes
to
chinese
refugees
and
muslim
terrorism
like
the
world
trade
center
bombing
we
cannot
tolerate
those
who
traffic
in
human
cargo
clinton
said
nor
can
we
allow
our
people
to
be
endangered
by
those
who
would
enter
our
country
to
terrorize
americans
antiimmigration
groups
grumble
that
clinton
didnt
go
far
enough
but
at
least
they
recognize
now
its
a
serious
problem
said
louisa
parker
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
how
funds
would
be
spent
in
his
proposal
to
curb
illegal
immigration
president
clinton
has
asked
for
an
additional
1725
million
the
money
would
boost
border
patrols
and
airport
security
speed
up
the
asylum
and
deportation
processes
and
provide
rewards
for
information
on
terrorist
how
the
money
would
be
distributed
