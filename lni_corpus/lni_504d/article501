the

been
criticized

shifts

lookout
listings
of
security
suspects
with
a
computer
system
already
in
place
at
newark
international
airport
mr
schumer
said
he
planned
to
introduce
legislation
that
would
allow
immigration
to
levy
a
250
charge
on
some
arriving
foreigners
to
raise
73
million
a
year
to
defray
processing
costs
