are
pushing
for
increased

as
a
tool
for
rooting
out

inside

the
nations
top
immigration
enforcer
says
michael
garcia
assistant
secretary
of
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
said
in
an
interview
with
the
denver
post
on
wednesday
that
his
agency
is
using
such
tactics
to
disrupt
potential
terrorist
cells
across
the
country
including
the
case
of
two
denver
residents
suspected
of
alqaeda
connections
we
have
a
powerful
lawenforcement
tool
in
immigration
enforcement
one
that
has
to
be
recognized
as
an
important
part
of
the
counterterrorism
effort
after
911
garcia
said
that
vision
highlights
the
changing
role
a
new
breed
of
aggressive
young
enforcement
officers
hopes
to
bring
to
an
agency
that
before
sept
11
2001
was
among
the
most
belittled
in
the
federal
bureaucracy
garcia
in
denver
for
a
national
conference
of
immigration
enforcement
agents
now
leads
the
postsept

equivalent
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
as
part
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
includes
parts
of
us
customs
the
federal
protective
service
and
the
air
marshals
its
more
than
20000
agents
are
tasked
with
everything
from
enforcing
immigration
law
to
protecting
federal
office
buildings
garcia
is
steering
the
agency
to
a
more
highprofile
role
one
concerned
less
with
dishwashers
and
construction
workers
he
said
than
the
nexus
between
immigration
and
the
infiltration
of
terrorists
our
mission
has
to
be
to
put
integrity
back
into
that
immigration
enforcement
system
in
order
to
prevent
the
next
act
of
terrorism
from
taking
place
he
said
two
recent
cases
show
the
agencys
effectiveness
he
said
a
virginia
resident
involved
in
raising
money
for
the
palestinian
terror
group
hamas
was
recently
accused
of
violations
of
us
immigration
and
tax
law
in
july
a
new
york
man
caught
videotaping
buildings
and
the
transit
system
in
dallas
was
charged
with
being
in
the
country
illegally
its
becoming
clear
garcia
said
that
immigration
and
terrorism
are
inseparable
issues
smugglers
who
bring
in
drugs
are
doing
it
for
profit
for
the
right
price
those
smuggling
operations
would
bring
in
people
who
are
looking
to
harm
our
national
security
