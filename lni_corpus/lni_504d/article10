wrestling
with
immigration
is
a
tough
job
a
couple
of
government
actions
this
year
suggested
that
the
state
wants
to
address
immigration
issues
but
without
really
making
any
waves
the
most
recent
was
governor
corzines
creation
of
an
unwieldy
blue
ribbon
immigration
panel
with
18
appointees
and
room
to
expand
to
nearly
30
the
panel
has
no
mandate
to
address
the
real
concern
illegal
immigration
with
a
15month
deadline
to
hand
recommendations
over
to
the
governor
the
commission
is
burdened
with
too
many
people
and
too
much
time
another
toothless
bite
of
the
illegal
immigration
apple
was
the
department
of
children
and
families
advisory
promising
dyfs
help
for
kids
left
behind
when
parents
are
deported
new
jersey
among
a
handful
of
states
that
passed
no
immigrationrelated
legislation
in
2007
offered
fragmented
policies
to
address
lack
of
federal
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
milgrams
ruling
attorney
general
anne
milgram
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
her
announcement
last
week
that
immigrants
arrested
for
serious
crimes
should
be
asked
about
their
immigration
status
was
nononsense
and
direct
the
question
needs
asking
not
to
be
punitive
to
the
law
abiding
immigrant
community
but
to
put
violent
felons
on
the
road
to
deportation
the
attorney
general
however
needs
to
clarify
procedures
for
local
law
enforcement
agencies
its
more
complicated
than
just
calling
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
when
immigrants
are
charged
with
a
crime
the
initial
stop
and
contact
with
local
police
leaves
too
much
room
for
racial
profiling
police
would
be
hardpressed
to
fairly
decide
which
people
they
arrest
should
be
quizzed
about
immigration
status
would
only
brownish
people
those
with
accented
english
or
those
with
nonanglicized
names
be
asked
whether
they
are
in
the
country
illegally
i
believe
the
directive
may
give
the
opportunity
for
racial
profiling
said
carlos
gonzalez
a
board
member
at
the
immigration
and
american
citizenship
organization
in
passaic
to
avoid
racial
profiling
he
would
prefer
that
judges
rather
than
the
arresting
officer
have
discretion
to
probe
the
citizenship
issue
suppose
that
the
person
is
canadian
is
the
same
question
going
to
be
asked
if
the
person
is
irish
and
looks
american
or
caucasian
gonzalez
said
david
wald
spokesman
for
milgrams
office
says
that
everyones
immigration
status
would
be
checked
not
only
those
who
appear
to
be
immigrants
it
is
unlikely
however
that
every
police
officer
who
arrests
a
perp
will
pose
the
question
about
immigration
status
wald
defends
milgrams
policy
as
an
extension
of
the
states
obligation
to
protect
everyone
in
fact
visitors
to
the
united
states
enjoy
the
protection
of
our
constitutional
guarantees
of
due
process
and
cannot
be
summarily
removed
immigration
policy
is
like
a
herd
of
bulls
in
a
controlled
stampede
in
pamplona
while
everyone
else
seems
to
be
running
scared
milgram
has
stopped
the
bull
shes
wrestling
with
an
important
immigration
policy
until
it
can
be
officially
repackaged
at
the
federal
level
its
refreshing
to
see
milgram
making
strong
immigration
policy
directives
without
fear
of
politics
at
the
same
time
the
federal
responsibility
to
fix
immigration
is
not
being
ignored
illegal
immigrants
are
under
a
more
intense
spotlight
following
the
murders
of
three
newark
college
students
two
of
the
accused
are
undocumented
and
have
arrest
records
in
the
united
states
a
passive
approach
the
united
states
has
taken
a
relatively
passive
approach
to
the
illegal
immigrants
living
among
us
they
are
not
stopped
randomly
they
are
not
harassed
about
assembling
and
demonstrating
they
are
permitted
to
work
their
skills
are
valued
and
they
are
paid
albeit
often
underpaid
for
their
labor
court
rulings
and
administrative
decisions
affirming
their
access
to
medical
care
and
education
permitted
many
to
plant
roots
in
american
soil
with
their
numbers
growing
steadily
for
more
than
a
decade
illegal
immigrants
live
here
in
relative
freedom
enjoying
material
comforts
they
lack
back
home
but
its
unrealistic
to
believe
it
could
last
forever
with
no
consequences
