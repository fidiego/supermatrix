immigration
reform
glimpse
of
the
future
in
arizona
and
utah
the
business
community
was
instrumental
in
defeating
an
arizona
birthrightcitizenship
bill
and
passing
a
utah
guestworker
program
suggesting
it
could
be
a
key
force
on
immigration

the
opposite
fortunes
of
two
sets
of
immigration
bills
this
week
one
in
arizona
and
the
other
in
utah
suggest
that
the
business
community
can
play
a
potentially
crucial
role
in
shaping
immigration
legislation
in
states
nationwide
in
arizona
its
opposition
to
five
antiillegal
immigration
bills
including
a
highprofile
attempt
to
deny
children
of
illegal
immigrants
birthright
citizenship
played
a
pivotal
role
in
turning
several
republican
state
senators
against
the
bills
which
failed
thursday
meanwhile
in
utah
business
groups
backed
a
suite
of
bills
that
included
a
measure
to
offer
twoyear
work
permits
to
undocumented
immigrants
under
certain
conditions
and
another
to
recruit
guest
workers
from
mexico
the
bills
were
signed
into
law
tuesday
at
a
time
when
the
republican
party
has
taken
an
increasingly
strident
position
against
illegal
immigration
the
two
votes
both
in
republicandominated
states
suggest
that
the
path
to
compromise
on
the
issue
might
be
through
the
business
community
which
often
has
strong
ties
to
gop
lawmakers
the
socalled
utah
compact
for
example
has
highlighted
the
degree
to
which
businesses
law
enforcement
agencies
and
community
leaders
can
work
together
to
address
the
comprehensive
realities
of
immigration
and
ultimately
influence
legislative
debate
at
both
the
state
and
national
levels
says
catherine
wilson
a
political
scientist
at
villanova
university
who
specializes
in
immigration
issues
the
utah
compact
has
been
hailed
as
a
potential
model
for
compromise
on
illegal
immigration
in
addition
to
its
provisions
on
undocumented
workers
it
also
requires
police
to
ask
suspects
arrested
in
connection
with
serious
crimes
about
their
immigration
status
it
was
clearly
the
salt
lake
chamber
of
commerce
and
businesses
more
broadly
that
were
driving
this
bus
says
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
in
washington
a
group
that
favors
restricting
immigration
in
short
experts
say
many
businesses
are
wary
of
hardline
antiillegal
immigration
laws
because
they
create
controversy
and
deny
access
to
cheap
labor
arizona
business
rebels
some
60
ceos
of
arizona
businesses
signed
a
letter
to
lawmakers
begging
them
to
stop
passing
harsh
antiillegal
immigrant
laws
says
angela
kelley
an
immigration
expert
at
the
center
for
american
progress
a
washington
think
tank
she
estimates
that
the
backlash
against
arizonas
sb
1070
cost
state
businesses
more
than
200
million
in
lost
convention
and
conference
business
not
including
the
ripple
effect
of
lost
jobs
earnings
and
tax
revenue
the
law
required
local
and
state
lawenforcement
officials
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
those
they
suspected
were
illegal
immigrants
though
the
most
controversial
aspects
have
never
been
implemented
because
of
a
legal
challenge
now
in
federal
court
the
arizona
business
community
which
did
not
lobby
against
sb
1070
was
instrumental
in
the
defeat
of
the
suite
of
bills
that
included
the
measure
to
deny
birthright
citizenship
state
business
leaders
say
i
think
the
business
community
here
has
had
a
long
overdue
impact
on
this
says
todd
landfried
spokesman
for
the
arizona
employers
for
immigration
reform
the
people
in
the
business
community
finally
said
enough
is
enough
and
told
the
senate
president
that
moving
these
bills
forward
now
is
damaging
us
at
a
time
when
businesses
are
moving
out
of
the
state
and
people
are
getting
laid
off
this
is
not
good
for
the
economy
or
the
people
of
arizona
he
adds
we
have
to
stop
this
utahs
pragmatic
approach
some
hispanic
activists
say
utah
is
merely
attempting
to
be
more
practical
utah
is
taking
a
more
pragmatic
and
economic
approach
to
address
the
complex
and
controversial
immigration
debate
says
randy
ertll
executive
director
of
el
centro
de
accion
social
in
pasadena
calif
they
learned
from
arizona
utahs
guestworker
program
for
example
is
a
pipeline
for
cheap
temporary
labor
from
latin
america
this
will
eventually
benefit
the
utah
economy
similar
to
how
the
bracero
program
benefited
the
national
us
economy
by
having
cheap
immigrant
labor
to
work
the
us
agricultural
fields
from
1942
to
1964
says
mr
ertll
therefore
utah
is
pushing
the
envelope
and
adopted
george
w
bushs
federal
ideology
of
a
guestworker
program
to
be
implemented
at
the
state
level
some
experts
claim
that
utahs
plan
like
sb
1070
will
not
pass
constitutional
muster
because
it
treads
on
washingtons
turf
immigration
is
a
federal
issue
but
utahs
willingness
to
attempt
reforms
like
guestworker
programs
which
are
anathema
to
many
conservative
republicans
is
significant
says
ms
kelley
it
doesnt
get
any
redder
than
