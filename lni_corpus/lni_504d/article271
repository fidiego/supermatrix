illegal
immigration
is
an
environmental
issue
for
shela
a
mcfarlin
who
has
seen
firsthand
the
tons
of
trash
dumped
in
the
fragile
arizona
desert
by
bordercrossers
illegal
aliens
have
turned
parts
of
the
southwest
desert
into
environmental
disaster
areas
dumping
an
estimated
25
million
pounds
of
trash
in
the
arizona
desert
carving
out
hundreds
of
miles
of
roads
through
the
wilderness
and
destroying
thousands
of
acres
of
habitat
with
cooking
fires
that
have
gone
awry
the
desert
environment
is
fairly
sensitive
so
were
concerned
about
the
damage
to
habitat
plants
and
animals
said
miss
mcfarlin
who
authored
the
bureau
of
land
managements
2006
report
on
environmental
damage
from
illegal
immigration
its
not
at
all
inviting
to
see
toilet
paper
fecal
matter
and
backpacks
by
the
thousands
not
at
all
once
the
immigrants
both
legal
and
illegal
arrive
the
scenario
isnt
much
rosier
immigration
is
now
the
primary
factor
in
us
population
growth
which
drives
such
environmental
woes
as
housing
sprawl
pollution
and
traffic
but
dont
expect
your
local
green
party
activist
to
grab
a
lawn
chair
and
join
the
minutemen
border
patrols
any
time
soon
the
mainstream
environmental
movement
is
firmly
and
uniformly
agnostic
on
the
issue
weve
never
taken
a
position
pro
or
con
on
immigration
sierra
club
spokesman
eric
antebi
said
we
dont
have
the
expertise
to
deal
with
that
illegal
immigration
wilderness
society
spokesman
ben
beach
said
these
responses
exasperate
environmentalists
such
as
dick
lamm
the
former
democratic
governor
of
colorado
and
a
30year
member
of
the
sierra
club
mr
lamm
broke
ranks
with
the
movement
years
ago
by
insisting
that
a
responsible
environmental
policy
has
to
include
population
and
immigration
controls
he
is
among
the
most
prominent
of
a
smallbuthardy
band
of
environmentalists
who
have
tried
for
years
to
push
the
movement
toward
an
antiimmigration
stance
so
far
they
havent
had
much
luck
the
environmental
movement
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
immigration
and
population
are
environmental
issues
mr
lamm
said
why
politics
he
said
the
environmental
movement
has
gone
politically
correct
mr
lamm
said
theyre
committing
political
malpractice
by
ignoring
population
but
jenny
neeley
southwest
representative
for
defenders
of
life
said
her
group
hasnt
taken
a
stance
on
immigration
reform
in
congress
because
i
dont
think
were
knowledgeable
enough
to
say
this
will
stop
the
illegal
crossingstfi
faced
with
a
difficult
choice
critics
said
the
environmental
movement
has
abandoned
its
primary
mission
protecting
the
planet
rather
than
deviate
from
the
liberal
establishment
theyre
still
pretty
much
ignoring
it
illegal
immigration
because
its
politically
sensitive
or
because
they
perceive
it
to
be
politically
sensitive
said
ira
mehlman
spokesman
for
the
federation
for
immigration
reform
nobody
denies
that
environmental
degradation
is
due
in
part
to
population
growth
and
nobody
denies
that
the
biggest
reason
for
population
growth
is
immigration
but
somehow
when
they
put
together
a
and
b
it
doesnt
lead
to
c
he
said
alienating
illegals
some
environmentalists
counter
that
population
control
is
an
issue
that
doesnt
respect
borders
whether
the
estimated
12
million
to
20
million
illegal
aliens
in
the
united
states
chose
to
live
in
new
mexico
or
mexico
city
they
are
still
part
of
a
global
overpopulation
problem
do
people
who
migrate
to
the
united
states
increase
environmental
stress
it
depends
on
where
they
would
end
up
otherwise
los
angeles
for
example
could
handle
10000
ecuadoreans
more
easily
than
the
galapagos
islands
could
sierra
club
executive
director
carl
pope
wrote
in
a
2004
article
in
the
groups
magazine
alan
kuper
a
longtime
sierra
club
member
and
a
critic
of
its
immigration
stance
said
this
is
an
unfair
comparison
because
americans
are
greater
consumers
of
resources
than
people
living
in
other
countries
thats
the
copout
argument
that
you
get
mr
kuper
said
an
individual
in
the
us
is
responsible
for
consumption
or
use
of
resources
of
about
30
times
the
resources
a
child
in
india
will
use
in
his
lifetime
critics
also
cite
the
groups
longstanding
policy
that
calls
first
for
us
population
control
then
global
stabilization
our
immigration
policy
cant
make
a
dent
in
world
poverty
and
we
take
in
two
times
more
immigrants
as
any
other
country
already
mr
lamm
said
the
question
is
how
can
the
us
best
help
the
environment
by
building
a
sustainable
society
other
environmentalists
acknowledge
that
they
tread
lightly
when
it
comes
to
illegal
immigration
in
order
to
protect
their
work
on
other
environmental
issues
because
its
such
a
charged
issue
in
this
country
its
hard
to
get
involved
without
getting
caught
in
the
crossfire
mr
antebi
said
we
have
a
history
of
working
with
a
large
number
of
constituencies
and
we
want
to
continue
to
work
with
them
if
wed
gotten
involved
with
the
immigration
issue
we
would
have
burned
a
lot
of
bridges
he
said
the
group
would
have
burned
those
bridges
not
just
with
its
allies
but
with
many
of
its
grassroots
members
we
tend
to
work
with
communities
that
have
a
lot
of
immigrants
mr
antebi
said
in
california
the
places
with
the
worst
air
pollution
tend
to
be
the
places
with
the
largest
number
of
immigrants
if
we
took
sides
on
immigration
pro
or
con
it
would
affect
our
relationships
with
these
communities
he
said
no
environmental
group
has
debated
the
immigration
issue
more
publicly
than
the
sierra
club
in
2004
and
2005
antiimmigration
candidates
attempted
to
reverse
the
clubs
direction
by
running
for
seats
on
its
15member
board
of
directors
all
of
them
lost
including
mr
lamm
in
2004
the
club
came
under
fire
in
2004
after
a
wealthy
donor
wall
street
investor
david
gelbaum
told
the
los
angeles
times
that
he
had
warned
mr
pope
in
1994
or
1995
that
he
would
never
give
another
dollar
if
the
club
ever
took
an
anti
immigration
stance
in
1996
the
club
voted
to
adopt
a
neutrality
stance
on
immigration
reversing
its
longstanding
position
in
favor
of
limiting
immigration
in
2000
and
2001
mr
gelbaum
donated
a
total
of
100
million
to
the
organization
critics
accused
the
sierra
club
of
selling
out
but
mr
antebi
denied
any
linkage
between
the
events
this
organization
is
too
big
and
too
democratic
in
its
grassroots
leadership
he
said
pointing
out
that
the
clubs
policies
are
set
by
its
elected
board
no
one
person
can
wield
that
much
influence
besides
he
said
sierra
club
members
hardly
need
to
be
bribed
to
recognize
the
merits
of
avoiding
the
immigration
debate
its
not
that
crazy
to
figure
out
why
an
organization
like
the
sierra
club
would
not
want
to
wade
into
an
issue
like
immigration
mr
antebi
said
protecting
anwr
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
thats
our
breadandbutter
reducing
airpollution
levels
thats
our
breadandbutter
immigration
thats
really
not
our
breadandbutter
remembering
zpg
at
one
time
however
stabilizing
the
us
population
was
indeed
a
central
tenet
of
the
environmental
movement
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
when
it
was
just
taking
root
the
call
for
zero
population
growth
was
as
loud
and
insistent
as
the
cry
for
cleaner
air
and
water
in
1970
the
sierra
club
adopted
a
policy
calling
for
the
nation
to
bring
about
the
stabilization
of
the
population
first
of
the
united
states
and
then
of
the
world
three
years
later
mr
pope
told
the
new
york
times
that
we
cant
hope
to
absorb
all
who
want
to
come
in
immigration
is
a
sentimental
symbol
whose
day
is
long
past
by
1998
however
the
environmental
movement
was
in
full
retreat
from
both
the
population
and
immigration
issue
roy
beck
and
leon
kolankiewicz
of
numbersusa
attribute
the
phenomenon
to
a
number
of
factors
including
the
drop
in
us
fertility
rates
however
the
researchers
from
the
immigrationreform
group
conclude
that
the
primary
cause
was
demographics
the
immigrants
were
hispanic
and
there
were
millions
of
them
environmental
leaders
soon
decided
they
couldnt
afford
a
political
skirmish
with
a
large
and
increasingly
influential
minority
group
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
sierra
club
leadership
gave
in
1998
for
avoiding
the
immigration
issue
was
that
they
dared
not
risk
appearing
to
be
racially
insensitive
the
authors
wrote
in
their
paper
the
environmental
movements
retreat
from
advocating
us
population
stabilization
19701998
the
authors
quote
mr
pope
in
a
1997
online
message
to
members
while
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
have
a
nonracial
debate
about
immigration
it
is
not
practically
possible
for
an
open
organization
like
the
sierra
club
to
do
so
recent
history
has
caused
me
to
change
my
view
of
whether
it
is
possible
for
the
sierra
club
to
deal
with
the
immigration
issue
in
a
way
which
would
not
implicate
us
in
ethnic
or
racial
polarization
while
that
calculation
might
be
correct
critics
say
theres
just
one
problem
it
puts
environmental
protection
second
the
result
has
been
the
birth
of
a
hybrid
political
movement
made
up
of
environmentalistscumimmigration
hawks
among
the
leaders
of
the
movement
is
mr
kuper
a
onetime
sierra
club
leader
and
retired
physics
professor
after
the
1996
neutrality
vote
mr
kuper
founded
sierrans
for
us
population
stabilization
a
splinter
group
of
disgruntled
members
devoted
to
returning
the
club
to
its
traditional
population
policy
the
group
developed
a
scorecard
that
grades
members
of
congress
on
their
votes
on
the
environment
immigration
and
familyplanning
issues
mr
kuper
also
regularly
lobbies
the
league
of
conservation
voters
to
include
immigration
on
its
list
of
issues
relations
between
the
rebels
and
the
mother
ship
arent
always
cordial
during
the
2004
and
2005
board
elections
the
antiimmigration
candidates
accused
sierra
club
staffers
of
playing
the
race
card
to
undermine
their
campaigns
after
the
2004
election
mr
pope
wrote
an
essay
titled
the
virus
of
hate
which
warned
members
against
a
possible
infiltration
of
the
club
by
racists
he
said
that
some
candidates
on
the
losing
side
had
entered
into
an
ugly
alliance
with
individuals
and
groups
whose
motivations
are
clearly
racist
mr
kuper
now
includes
a
disclaimer
on
his
web
site
denouncing
racism
under
the
heading
no
to
racism
yes
to
environmentalism
battle
at
the
border
one
issue
that
could
pull
the
environmental
community
back
into
the
immigration
debate
is
the
degradation
at
the
border
the
bureau
of
land
management
estimates
that
only
1
percent
of
the
25
million
tons
of
garbage
left
in
the
southern
arizona
desert
has
been
hauled
off
since
2002
the
hardesthit
areas
include
the
cabeza
prieta
national
wildlife
refuge
which
now
includes
about
200
miles
of
illegal
roads
carved
into
the
landscape
by
trucks
and
offroad
vehicles
prompting
the
wilderness
society
to
issue
an
alert
the
trash
problem
is
staggering
to
say
the
least
said
defenders
of
lifes
miss
neeley
whose
group
has
been
active
in
cleanup
efforts
if
youve
seen
it
its
almost
surreal
the
groups
solution
however
isnt
likely
to
warm
the
hearts
of
immigration
hawks
instead
of
calling
for
a
clampdown
on
illegal
immigration
both
groups
have
stern
words
for
the
us
border
patrol
calling
on
the
agency
to
make
a
stronger
commitment
to
environmental
protection
miss
neeley
said
in
a
2006
article
in
an
environmental
groups
publication
that
the
problem
lies
with
the
agencys
decision
to
push
illegal
aliens
from
urban
points
of
entry
such
as
nogales
ariz
to
the
desert
the
idea
was
to
make
crossing
the
border
more
difficult
but
the
result
has
been
the
degradation
of
protected
lands
she
said
in
the
sky
island
alliances
newsletter
the
border
patrol
also
needs
to
drive
on
established
roads
and
avoid
carving
new
ones
through
the
wilderness
environmentalists
say
the
groups
also
are
uniformly
opposed
to
a
border
wall
or
fence
which
they
say
would
cut
off
wildlife
migration
routes
what
about
the
actual
bordercrossers
who
rarely
stick
to
the
main
highway
of
course
thats
being
done
by
crossers
too
but
we
cant
tell
crossers
hey
youre
breaking
these
lawstfi
miss
neeley
said
the
blametheborder
patrol
response
exasperates
agency
spokesman
gus
soto
who
suggests
that
the
illegal
aliens
drug
smugglers
and
human
smugglers
bear
greater
responsibility
for
the
damage
than
its
officers
unfortunately
they
do
choose
to
point
the
finger
at
us
but
you
have
to
remember
were
not
the
ones
out
there
crossing
were
not
the
ones
out
there
creating
roads
were
trying
to
stop
the
smuggling
industry
mr
soto
said
the
agency
has
implemented
a
training
program
for
its
officers
in
environmental
awareness
officers
often
patrol
sensitive
areas
via
aircraft
or
on
horseback
and
they
feed
their
horses
only
with
seeds
that
are
indigenous
to
the
region
we
dont
go
offroad
mr
soto
said
before
we
do
anything
we
have
to
do
an
environmentalimpact
study
to
make
sure
it
wont
have
a
negative
impact
we
dont
want
to
leave
an
environmental
footprint
in
these
sensitive
areas
the
smugglers
on
the
other
hand
will
cross
anywhere
without
concern
for
the
environment
he
said
its
the
smugglers
that
are
doing
this
not
the
border
patrol
were
going
after
the
people
who
are
causing
the
environmental
harm
they
have
their
differences
but
one
thing
both
the
border
patrol
and
defenders
of
wildlife
do
agree
on
is
that
something
must
be
done
to
reduce
the
total
number
of
bordercrossers
and
thats
a
start
if
we
dont
start
reducing
the
total
number
of
crossers
the
problem
is
only
going
to
get
worse
miss
neeley
said
and
so
far
the
environmental
community
really
hasnt
had
an
adequate
response
