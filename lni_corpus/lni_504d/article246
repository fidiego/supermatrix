immigration
officials
about
any
undocumented
person
arrested
for
an
indictable
crime
under
a
directive
issued
wednesday
by
attorney
general
anne
milgram
the
need
for
consistent
state
policy
on
immigration
notification
became
evident
recently
after
a
man
identified
as
being
in
the
country
illegally
was
charged
in
a
triple
homicide
in
newark
milgram
said
during
a
news
conference
some
counties
and
local
police
departments
do
it
all
the
time
some
sometimes
do
it
and
some
never
she
said
that
changes

directive
requires
that
police
check
the
citizenship
nationality
and
immigration
status
of
suspects
during
the
booking
process
for
charges
linked
to
serious
crimes
and
for
driving
while
intoxicated
an
officer
who
finds
or
suspects
illegal
status
must
notify
immigration
officials
as
well
as
the
prosecuting
agency
and
the
courts
illegal
immigrants
suspected
of
serious
crimes
can
be
a
flight
risk
the
attorney
general
said
immigration
officials
have
the
power
to
detain
an
illegal
immigrant
based
on
the
civil
violation
of
being
in
the
united
states
unlawfully
pending
the
prosecution
of
criminal
charges
you
want
to
make
sure
the
federal
government
knows
and
the
county
and
local
prosecutors
know
a
suspects
immigration
status
milgram
said
its
relevant
to

whether
an
individual
has
sufficient
ties

the
community
in

years
2005
and
2006
ice
received
roughly
7400
inquiries
about
immigration
status
from
new
jersey
law
enforcement
authorities
said
ice
spokesman
michael
gilhooly
so
far
this
year
that
number
has
risen
to
9400
he
said
some
local
police
in
passaic
and
bergen
counties
said
they
already
ask
for
proof
of
citizenship
status
from
people
arrested
for
major
crimes
such
as
robbery
and
murder
although
not
necessarily
for
drunk
driving
they
also
said
they
wish
immigration
officials
would
more
consistently
respond
to
their
calls
too
often
they
said
immigration
authorities
seem
too
busy
to
respond
i
would
like
to
see
immigration
intervene
immediately
said
capt
robert
rowan
of
the
clifton
police
department
scott
weber
the
field
office
director
for
ice
in
newark
said
the
agency
is
prepared
for
an
increased
workload
stemming
from
the
directive
we
can
handle
it
he
said
milgram
emphasized
that
the
directive
isnt
tantamount
to
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
it
also
prohibits
law
enforcement
authorities
from
inquiring
about
the
immigration
status
of
crime
victims
and
witnesses
she
said
adding
that
her
office
will
monitor
how
police
implement
it
but
local
cops
are
wary
of
taking
on
any
of
the
duties
of
federal
immigration
agents
elmwood
park
police
chief
donald
ingrasselino
said
that
acting
on
behalf
of
immigration
would
jeopardize
his
ability
to
help
victims
and
gain
information
from
witnesses
about
crimes
as
it
is
he
said
immigrants
overly
fear
the
police
if
police
start
taking
that
role
on
its
a
big
tradeoff
ingrasselino
said
we
need
them
to
cooperate
with
us
to
do
our
job
