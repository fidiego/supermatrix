immigration
has
shot
to
center
stage
in
washington
following
the
signing
friday
by
gov
jan
brewer
r
of
arizona
of
legislation
that
makes
it
a
state
crime
to
be
in
the
united
states
illegally
the
law
also
requires
arizona
police
officers
to
question
people
about
their
immigration
status
if
there
is
cause
for
suspicion
it
is
being
called
the
toughest
legislation
against
illegal
immigration
in
the
country
at
the
signing
ceremony
in
phoenix
governor
brewer
defended
what
she
called
her
unwavering
signature
on
the
bill
despite
concerns
that
the
new
law
could
result
in
racial
profiling
and
other
violations
of
civil
liberties
arizona
which
borders
on
mexico
has
long
struggled
with
illegal
immigration
brewer
discussed
borderrelated
violence
and
crime
due
to
illegal
immigration
but
added
that
she
had
worked
with
legislators
to
strengthen
civilrights
protections
in
the
bill
brewer
also
blamed
washington
for
failing
to
address
the
immigration
crisis
in
the
us
where
estimates
of
the
undocumented
immigrant
population
range
from
12
million
to
20
million
we
in
arizona
have
been
more
than
patient
waiting
for
washington
to
act
brewer
said
but
decades
of
inaction
and
misguided
policy
have
created
a
dangerous
and
unacceptable
situation
obama
urges
congress
to
pass
immigration
legislationin
remarks
friday
morning
before
brewers
decision
to
sign
was
known
president
obama
called
the
bill
misguided
and
said
he
had
instructed
members
of
his
administration
to
closely
monitor
the
situation
and
examine
the
civil
rights
and
other
implications
of
this
legislation
he
also
urged
congress
to
proceed
with
legislation
in
an
effort
to
preempt
actions
by
other
state
legislatures
our
failure
to
act
responsibly
at
the
federal
level
will
only
open
the
door
to
irresponsibility
by
others
obama
said
in
a
rose
garden
naturalization
ceremony
for
24
foreignborn
members
of
the
us
military
and
that
includes
for
example
the
recent
efforts
in
arizona
which
threaten
to
undermine
basic
notions
of
fairness
that
we
cherish
as
americans
as
well
as
the
trust
between
police
and
their
communities
that
is
so
crucial
to
keeping
us
safe
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
d
of
nevada
said
earlier
this
week
that
he
would
accelerate
action
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform
putting
it
ahead
of
an
energy
bill
the
legislation
would
address
both
border
enforcement
as
well
as
a
guestworker
program
and
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
workers
house
democrats
have
expressed
skepticism
that
such
legislation
can
pass
amid
washingtons
sharp
partisanship
especially
in
the
runup
to
midterm
elections
i
am
not
sure
the
senate
can
move
an
immigration
bill
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d
of
maryland
said
at
a
monitor
breakfast
thursday
but
he
added
if
senator
reid
can
move
an
immigration
bill
the
position
the
speaker
and
i
have
taken
is
we
will
address
that
matter
immigration
can
be
a
politically
risky
issueimmigration
is
a
politically
charged
issue
for
both
parties
for
democrats
the
reward
for
taking
up
immigration
is
that
it
satisfies
the
hispanic
lobby
which
has
long
fought
for
comprehensive
reform
obama
won
68
percent
of
the
hispanic
vote
in
his
presidential
election
and
its
a
constituency
he
wants
to
hold
but
there
are
major
risks
for
democrats
in
promoting
anything
that
can
be
called
amnesty
which
is
how
opponents
characterize
a
pathway
to
citizenship
democratic
members
of
congress
sitting
in
swing
districts
and
states
are
leery
of
voting
for
an
immigration
reform
that
can
be
used
against
them
in
november
thus
the
doubts
about
passing
legislation
this
year
for
republicans
the
risk
in
opposing
reform
is
that
they
lose
political
ground
with
hispanics
the
fastestgrowing
minority
in
the
country
democrats
hope
they
can
bring
along
at
least
a
few
senate
republicans
both
in
crafting
legislative
language
and
in
reaching
the
60
votes
needed
to
defeat
an
expected
filibuster
so
far
sen
lindsey
graham
r
of
south
carolina
is
the
only
republican
senator
working
with
democrats
on
a
bill
on
tuesday
obama
reached
out
to
several
other
senate
republicans
with
no
success
