immigration
judges
pushing
for
independence
length
1219
words
federal
immigration
judges
are
urging
congress
to
liberate
them
from
the
department
of
justice
a
dramatic
bid
for
independence
that
could
eventually
open
immigration
court
records
to
the
public
for
the
first
time
in
us
history
as
lawmakers
debate
immigration
legislation
the
judges
have
intensified
lobbying
efforts
in
washington
with
phone
calls
letters
and
personal
trips
to
the
capitol
armed
with
support
from
national
legal
organizations
including
the
american
bar
association
and
the
federal
bar
association
the
judges
say
the
backlogged
immigration
courts
need
the
freedom
to
control
their
own
budgets
issue
timely
decisions
and
prevent
unfair
treatment
of
judges
all
things
they
maintain
are
not
happening
within
the
justice
department
bureaucracy
the
doj
has
contributed
to
selling
the
immigration
courts
short
rather
than
defending
their
independence
or
enhancing
their
stature
the
judges
union
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
said
in
a
report
given
to
congress
this
has
serious
and
insidious
repercussions
a
move
out
of
the
justice
department
could
also
allow
immigration
judges
to
decide
which
court
records
be
kept
from
the
public
similar
to
regular
courts
the
judges
call
for
independence
comes
as
labor
unions
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
which
runs
enforcement
and
citizenship
services
are
calling
on
congress
to
fix
immigration
laws
and
be
more
transparent
to
the
public
traditional
court
records
are
public
but
immigration
court
and
arrest
records
are
generally
confidential
to
protect
the
immigrants
privacy
somebody
needs
to
flip
the
light
switch
on
and
make
all
of
this
stuff
more
visible
said
chris
crane
president
of
the
national
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
council
which
represents
detention
and
deportation
officers
these
people
work
for
the
taxpayers
why
should
they
be
able
to
hide
anything
the
judges
lobbying
is
the
latest
sign
of
a
glaring
disconnect
between
the
immigration
officers
on
the
front
lines
and
the
lawmakers
in
washington
who
are
charting
their
future
in
a
sometimes
haphazard
effort
to
fix
the
nations
troubled
immigration
system
and
address
the
11
million
immigrants
in
the
united
states
illegally
the
judges
feel
a
sense
of
urgency
because
they
fear
that
new
immigration
legislation
if
it
passes
could
flood
the
courts
with
new
cases
their
request
for
independence
won
little
support
from
the
senate
which
passed
an
immigration
bill
last
month
that
ignored
their
request
but
now
the
judges
are
targeting
the
house
its
just
been
impossible
to
get
the
attention
that
we
need
and
yet
it
is
so
counterintuitive
because
we
are
such
an
essential
part
of
the
process
said
immigration
judge
dana
leigh
marks
president
of
the
union
which
represents
more
than
200
judges
in
59
courts
nationwide
its
one
of
the
keys
to
why
the
system
keeps
failing
a
senate
aide
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
senators
crafting
the
bill
feared
an
independent
court
would
be
too
costly
the
future
of
the
senate
bill
is
uncertain
because
house
leaders
have
said
they
would
not
take
it
up
and
instead
would
focus
on
their
own
legislation
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
the
justice
department
agency
that
runs
the
courts
also
raised
concerns
about
the
cost
of
an
independent
immigration
court
the
office
and
the
senate
aide
could
not
say
how
much
the
separate
court
would
cost
the
type
of
civil
administrative
adjudications
that
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
conducts
are
designed
to
be
handled
within
the
structure
of
the
department
and
it
would
take
significant
resources
to
create
an
agency
separate
from
an
executive
branch
cabinet
officer
which
we
believe
to
be
unnecessary
at
this
time
kathryn
mattingly
a
spokeswoman
for
the
office
said
in
an
email
though
they
wear
black
robes
and
preside
over
courtrooms
the
judges
are
lawyers
named
by
the
attorney
general
the
nations
top
prosecutor
and
the
head
of
the
department
of
justice
it
took
over
the
courts
from
the
department
of
labor
in
1940
amid
national
security
concerns
during
world
war
ii
immigration
judges
have
slowly
gained
prestige
over
the
years
in
the
earliest
days
they
were
merely
hearing
officers
but
later
they
were
required
to
be
lawyers
in
the
1970s
they
were
referred
to
as
judges
a
title
that
is
now
part
of
the
law
in
1983
the
department
of
justice
created
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
to
run
the
courts
giving
the
judges
a
measure
of
autonomy
but
the
judges
union
told
congress
that
the
courts
ties
to
the
department
of
justice
have
damaged
its
credibility
in
documents
to
congress
the
union
recited
a
litany
of
conflicts
including
the
illegal
recruiting
of
judges
during
the
previous
administration
based
on
their
political
affiliations
and
the
failure
of
the
justice
department
to
allow
judges
to
hold
people
in
contempt
the
union
said
some
judges
have
even
faced
discipline
for
issuing
unfavorable
decisions
as
of
june
the
courts
had
more
than
300000
cases
pending
which
the
judges
called
a
record
high
including
more
than
8000
in
boston
according
to
the
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
at
syracuse
university
at
the
same
time
immigration
judges
say
they
suffer
burnout
handling
about
1500
cases
each
compared
with
440
for
federal
judges
in
lifeordeath
matters
including
immigrants
facing
deportation
to
countries
where
their
lives
might
be
in
danger
marks
an
immigration
judge
in
san
francisco
said
the
congressional
budget
office
should
determine
the
cost
of
an
independent
court
before
lawmakers
dismiss
the
proposal
in
its
proposal
the
judges
union
urged
congress
to
use
its
power
under
article
1
of
the
constitution
to
create
an
independent
court
of
judges
named
by
the
president
to
a
fixed
term
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
those
judges
would
not
have
lifetime
tenure
or
the
salary
protections
that
regular
federal
judges
have
the
judges
modeled
their
proposal
after
the
us
tax
court
created
in
1969
amid
similar
concerns
about
conflicts
of
interest
under
the
department
of
treasury
though
tax
court
judges
decisions
and
records
are
generally
public
professors
said
immigration
court
records
would
be
open
to
the
public
only
if
congress
or
the
judges
made
it
so
marks
said
it
is
likely
the
judges
would
follow
the
tradition
of
regular
courts
limiting
access
only
to
cases
that
would
endanger
someones
safety
we
support
the
same
amount
of
transparency
that
other
courts
receive
she
said
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
has
also
backed
the
creation
of
an
independent
court
if
were
going
to
put
peoples
futures
in
their
hands
then
we
need
them
to
be
a
truly
independent
decision
maker
and
not
an
arm
of
carrying
out
the
policies
of
the
justice
department
said
crystal
williams
executive
director
for
the
immigration
lawyers
association
others
doubted
the
house
and
senate
would
change
the
immigration
court
system
now
since
they
cannot
even
agree
on
the
broader
issue
of
immigration
overhaul
i
think
its
very
unlikely
said
kent
barnett
assistant
professor
at
the
university
of
georgia
school
of
law
i
dont
know
that
were
going
to
get
something
that
would
be
a
relatively
major
administrative
change
through
this
kind
of
gridlock
in
congress
