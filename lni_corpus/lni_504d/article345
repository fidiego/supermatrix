a
us
immigration
court
ruling
is
making
it
harder
for
the
government
to
deport
many
undocumented
immigrants
thousands
of
immigrants
who
face
deportation
proceedings
but
fail
to
appear
for
hearings
have
been
ordered
almost
routinely
to
be
deported
but
a
decision
issued
in
october
by
the
us
board
of
immigration
appeals
halts
that
practice
unless
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
can
show
that
it
has
delivered
a
notice
of
the
proceedings
to
the
immigrant
although
foreign
residents
have
been
required
by
longstanding
but
unenforced
federal
law
to
report
changes
of
address
to
the
us
government
the
rule
shifts
the
burden
of
finding
current
addresses
to
the
ins
the
results
already
are
being
felt
in
the
justice
departments
immigration
courts
which
are
part
of
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
in
federal
immigration
court
wednesday
in
arlington
va
judge
m
christopher
grant
finished
his
docket
and
turned
to
the
eight
cases
in
which
the
immigrants
failed
to
appear
two
months
ago
most
of
the
noshows
would
have
been
ordered
in
absentia
to
be
deported
but
the
judge
ordered
deportation
for
only
one
a
man
from
el
salvador
who
had
been
found
hidden
in
a
truck
in
arizona
with
100
other
undocumented
immigrants
the
ins
showed
that
it
had
later
delivered
to
the
man
a
notice
to
appear
in
the
other
cases
the
ins
failed
to
satisfy
the
court
that
sending
notification
by
firstclass
mail
to
the
lastknown
address
was
enough
the
ins
must
instruct
the
alien
on
the
rules
of
the
game
grant
said
he
ordered
the
cases
against
the
seven
other
missing
immigrants
to
be
closed
unless
the
ins
could
restart
the
process
by
finding
the
people
charged
and
informing
them
of
the
deportation
proceedings
the
new
standard
could
have
a
substantial
impact
on
rulings
in
the
nations
52
immigration
courts
which
processed
45589
absentia
cases
in
fiscal
year
2000
about
one
of
every
five
cases
was
a
noshow
the
new
standards
could
reduce
the
impact
of
an
ins
effort
announced
last
week
to
find
immigrants
who
have
been
ordered
out
of
the
country
but
who
have
disappeared
before
they
could
be
deported
the
immigration
service
has
said
it
will
enter
the
names
of
more
than
300000
of
those
missing
deportees
into
the
fbis
crime
database
so
that
police
officers
will
be
alerted
to
them
if
they
conduct
routine
computer
checks
during
arrests
even
for
minor
traffic
offenses
fewer
names
will
be
added
to
the
deportee
list
in
the
future
as
courts
close
the
absentia
cases
administratively
instead
of
issuing
deportation
orders
it
bodes
ill
for
ever
finding
these
people
said
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
research
group
that
favors
more
restrictions
on
immigration
now
when
they
get
stopped
for
a
broken
tail
light
their
name
isnt
going
to
come
up
in
the
computer
check
jeanne
butterfield
lobbyist
for
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
welcomed
the
new
limits
on
deportations
the
ins
has
been
notoriously
bad
about
keeping
accurate
address
records
butterfield
said
even
when
immigrants
notify
the
agency
of
address
changes
she
also
said
the
ins
sometimes
sends
immigrants
a
notice
of
a
hearing
for
an
unspecified
date
and
then
waits
years
to
file
the
document
with
the
immigration
court
the
appeals
board
rightfully
says
we
need
in
some
way
to
protect
the
aliens
right
here
butterfield
said
immigration
lawyers
will
be
challenging
deportation
orders
for
many
of
the
300000
cases
that
the
ins
is
turning
over
to
the
fbi
she
said
many
of
the
immigrants
didnt
realize
they
had
been
deported
because
the
notice
never
reached
them
she
said
karen
kraushaar
a
spokeswoman
for
the
ins
said
the
agency
is
studying
the
ruling
but
she
said
she
had
no
response
on
its
effects
in
the
case
that
triggered
the
change
in
policy
an
el
salvador
woman
known
only
by
the
initials
gyr
came
illegally
into
the
united
states
in
1982
and
requested
asylum
the
ins
in
part
because
of
a
political
dispute
over
the
influx
of
el
salvador
refugees
took
no
action
until
1997
when
the
agency
sent
a
notice
for
an
asylum
interview
to
the
womans
last
known
address
when
she
did
not
respond
the
ins
followed
up
with
a
notice
for
a
removal
hearing
which
she
also
did
not
receive
the
ins
then
sought
a
deportation
order
in
absentia
which
the
immigration
court
rejected
the
immigration
appeals
board
decision
acknowledged
that
virtually
every
alien
in
the
united
states
is
under
an
affirmative
obligation
to
report
address
changes
to
the
government
failure
to
comply
may
incur
various
penalties
the
ruling
said
it
added
that
an
absentia
deportation
order
is
not
one
of
them
