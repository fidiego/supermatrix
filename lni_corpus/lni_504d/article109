ipsos
has
just
released
a
poll
measuring
citizens
perception
of
immigration
in
23
countries
despite
what
politicians
around
the
world
would
have
their
countrymen
believe
the
average
person
isnt
buying
the
benefits
of
current
immigration
policy
the
poll
proves
that
our
collective
gut
is
indeed
in
line
with
reality
80
percent
of
world
citizens
from
russia
and
brazil
to
america
and
india
feel
that
immigration
has
increased
over
the
past
five
years
with
52
percent
feeling
its
too
much
of
respondents
45
percent
believe
immigration
has
a
negative
impact
on
their
country
this
is
legal
aboveboard
immigration
with
which
people
are
taking
issue
while
politicians
in
america
typically
focus
on
the
12
million
or
so
illegal
immigrants
they
often
ignore
the
fact
that
the
country
is
taking
in
more
than
a
million
new
legal
immigrants
every
year
america
may
have
been
built
on
immigration
but
it
wasnt
the
kind
of
mass
third
world
immigration
that
weve
been
seeing
over
the
past
40
years
the
left
originally
introduced
the
concept
of
third
world
multiculturalism
to
america
during
the
lyndon
johnson
presidency
through
the
democratic
partys
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1965
it
was
born
of
whiteguilt
overkill
in
the
shade
of
the
civil
rights
movement
at
the
time
democratic
sen
ted
kennedy
said
contrary
to
the
charges
in
some
quarters
the
bill
will
not
inundate
america
with
immigrants
from
any
one
country
or
area
or
the
most
populated
and
deprived
nations
of
africa
and
asia
in
the
final
analysis
the
ethnic
pattern
of
immigration
under
the
proposed
measure
is
not
expected
to
change
as
sharply
as
the
critics
seem
to
think
the
bill
will
not
flood
our
cities
with
immigrants
it
will
not
upset
the
ethnic
mix
of
our
society
it
will
not
relax
the
standards
of
admission
it
will
not
cause
american
workers
to
lose
their
jobs
in
the
true
final
analysis
the
new
law
opened
the
floodgates
to
exponentially
more
third
world
immigrants
than
originally
planned
and
did
it
on
the
basis
of
family
reunification
rather
than
skill
before
the
new
law
immigrants
to
the
us
came
overwhelmingly
from
western
european
democracies
and
canada
afterward
immigration
from
latin
america
and
asia
dominated
while
european
immigration
was
reduced
from
86
percent
of
the
total
to
a
mere
sliver
of
13
percent
the
law
led
to
an
influx
of
new
democratic
voters
via
immigration
now
any
politician
wanting
to
land
this
growing
immigrant
vote
whether
democrat
or
republican
had
better
find
a
way
to
pander
to
the
idea
of
multiculturalism
or
theoretically
risk
alienating
a
major
swath
of
voters
ronald
reagan
presided
over
nearrecord
levels
of
annual
legal
immigration
and
george
w
bush
was
anything
but
tough
on
immigration
maintaining
immigration
levels
from
the
same
countries
against
which
we
struggled
ideologically
in
the
aftermath
of
sept
11
2001
no
one
wants
to
touch
it
the
idea
of
any
and
all
legal
immigration
being
a
net
positive
is
something
that
has
been
deeply
planted
in
the
public
conscience
through
leftist
brainwashing
and
diversitypromotion
initiatives
typically
starting
in
the
public
education
system
if
anything
the
ipsos
poll
finally
proves
this
to
be
definitively
true
with
the
most
educated
respondents
being
the
most
supportive
of
immigration
educated
canadians
have
the
most
positive
view
of
immigration
of
anyone
in
the
world
as
a
product
of
that
system
i
can
vouch
for
the
amount
of
multicultural
and
diversity
peddling
to
which
the
average
student
is
subjected
in
the
absence
of
any
counterpoint
this
despite
the
fact
that
the
two
founding
factions
french
and
english
canadians
havent
ever
gotten
along
even
leading
to
a
period
of
french
nationalist
terrorism
which
has
since
been
subdued
by
repeatedly
buying
off
the
frenchcanadian
province
of
quebec
perhaps
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
ipsos
survey
and
most
in
conflict
with
current
us
policy
is
that
45
percent
of
people
prefer
skilled
educated
immigrants
who
take
highlevel
jobs
that
locals
wont
do
over
lowskilled
immigrants
or
those
who
dont
work
at
all
so
future
policy
ought
to
focus
on
importing
top
talent
and
limiting
lowlevel
immigration
which
is
also
a
recipe
for
competitive
success
in
the
global
economy
it
would
be
a
safe
place
for
politicians
to
start
on
a
subject
theyve
all
been
avoiding
