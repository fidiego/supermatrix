mariana
c
cordier
president
of
the
maryland
hispanic
bar
association
has
heard
an
increasing
number
of
complaints
over
the
past
year
from
people
who
say
their
immigration
applications
were
botched
by
consultants
the
demographics
have
changed
so
much
that
you
start
to
see
these
things
happening
more
and
more
said
cordier
a
rockville
attorney
the
growing
number
of
hispanics
in
the
area
has
given
rise
to
a
number
of
immigration
consultants
she
said
consultants
say
they
provide
a
useful
service
because
they
understand
the
immigration
application
requirements
and
charge
less
than
lawyers
to
help
with
the
paperwork
but
cordier
said
that
in
some
cases
immigration
consultants
have
failed
to
file
the
correct
papers
causing
their
clients
to
be
deported
the
maryland
general
assembly
this
month
passed
legislation
that
would
give
people
who
use
immigration
consultants
more
protection
california
washington
new
mexico
and
a
handful
of
other
states
already
have
laws
that
regulate
immigration
consultants
but
the
district
and
virginia
do
not
according
to
the
national
consumer
law
center
the
maryland
legislation
known
as
the
immigration
consulting
services
act
awaits
gov
robert
l

the

lead
sponsor
del
kathleen
m
dumais
dmontgomery
said
she
expects
him
to
sign
it
in
the
next
few
weeks
even
if
he
vetoes
it
she
said
the
act
has
enough
support
to
override
a
veto
it
passed
the
house
121
to
5
and
the
senate
unanimously
the
legislation
curbs
the
services
immigration
consultants
are
allowed
to
perform
and
the
claims
they
may
make
penalties
include
a
fine
of
up
to
1000
or
a
year
in
prison
victims
also
have
the
right
to
sue
to
recoup
the
money
they
paid
to
the
immigration
consultant
and
to
collect
damages
dumais
said
she
has
heard
from
a
wide
range
of
immigrant
communities
that
have
been
affected
by
consultants
including
people
from
latin
america
vietnam
and
africa
some
immigration
consultants
say
they
welcome
the
oversight
patrick
tzeuton
an
attorney
and
the
owner
of
immigration
consultants
inc
in
silver
spring
said
his
company
caters
to
people
who
have
recently
moved
to
the
area
from
cameroon
in
west
africa
services
are
offered
mostly
in
french
two
lawyers
work
in
the
office
with
four
immigration
consultants
who
file
forms
for
visa
extensions
or
work
documents
many
immigrants
like
to
use
the
consultants
because
they
are
cheaper
than
lawyers
said
tzeuton
it
is
no
different
than
going
to
a
pharmacist
or
a
nurse
instead
of
a
doctor
vincent
rosario
an
accountant
notary
and
consultant
said
he
is
careful
how
he
advises
people
who
come
to
him
for
help
with
immigration
applications
rosario
runs
his
business
crusa
servicios
latinos
from
his
home
in
the
district
and
also
works
from
an
office
in
sterling
he
charges
customers
75
to
100
to
help
them
complete
an
application
for
a
temporary
visa
to
bring
a
relative
to
the
united
states
if
a
customer
has
more
complicated
issues
or
wants
a
work
visa
he
said
he
refers
them
to
a
lawyer
i
dont
play
with
that
i
dont
give
legal
advice
said
rosario
who
emigrated
from
the
dominican
republic
20
years
ago
if
i
do
give
advice
i
let
them
know
that
it
is
not
official
some
immigrant
advocates
and
lawyers
said
other
consultants
do
more
immigration
consultants
are
a
particular
problem
among
the
spanishspeaking
population
because
of
the
use
of
the
spanish
word
notario
said
kimberly
propeack
director
of
advocacy
at
casa
de
maryland
a
takoma
park
nonprofit
that
works
with
latino
immigrants
many
immigration
consultants
are
notaries
and
in
some
parts
of
latin
america
a
notario
may
conduct
certain
legal
proceedings
in
the
united
states
notary
publics
only
administer
oaths
and
attest
to
the
authenticity
of
signatures
sometimes
notarios
here
say
they
can
provide
legal
advice
and
help
prepare
immigration
forms
this
is
one
of
the
biggest
legal
issues
in
our
community
propeack
said
they
are
really
quite
blatant
jayesh
rathod
a
staff
attorney
at
casa
de
maryland
who
is
working
on
three
cases
of
immigration
applications
that
were
fouled
up
by
consultants
said
he
thinks
the
new
law
will
have
a
deterrent
effect
up
to
now
ive
seen
almost
nothing
done
about
such
problems
he
added
rathod
is
trying
to
help
carlos
gomez
who
moved
to
alexandria
from
el
salvador
get
a
work
permit
gomez
paid
an
immigration
consultant
in
falls
church
30
to
fill
out
his
visa
application
when
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
sent
him
a
card
requesting
more
information
he
took
it
to
the
consultant
whose
name
he
no
longer
remembers
she
told
me
they
were
crazy
and
that
i
didnt
have
to
send
in
the
information
gomez
said
in
spanish
i
trusted
her
and
then
i
got
another
card
saying
they
had
denied
me
other
immigrants
testified
about
their
problems
before
maryland
legislators
during
the
bills
hearings
amy
nunez
a
mexican
immigrant
who
lives
in
frederick
told
legislators
that
her
husband
who
came
to
maryland
without
legal
documents
was
deported
to
mexico
after
they
enlisted
the
help
of
an
immigration
consultant
who
took
3000
from
them
and
fled
according
to
cordier
the
recently
passed
bill
would
force
immigration
consultants
to
return
any
documents
that
a
customer
gives
them
in
some
instances
consultants
have
refused
to
provide
copies
of
the
paperwork
they
claim
to
have
filed
with
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
some
lawyers
said
the
bill
also
makes
it
illegal
to
advertise
that
a
notary
license
allows
a
person
to
provide
legal
advice
and
requires
that
immigration
consultants
provide
a
contract
in
both
english
and
the
customers
native
language
before
working
on
the
customers
behalf
it
also
prevents
consultants
from
saying
they
can
obtain
special
favors
from
us
immigration
agencies
and
from
collecting
money
from
clients
before
they
perform
any
services
immigration
consultants
must
also
post
signs
in
their
offices
stating
that
the
consultant
is
not
a
licensed
attorney
and
cannot
give
legal
advice
or
services
