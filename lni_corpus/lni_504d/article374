a
senate
panel
voted
yesterday
to
split
up
a
major
immigration
bill
an
action
that
may
doom
efforts
to
cut
legal
immigration
while
propelling
legislation
to
prevent
illegal
immigration
immigration
proponents
hailed
the
bipartisan
126
vote
of
the
judiciary
committee
as
a
turning
point
in
a
hot
immigration
debate
touched
off
by
californias
proposition
187
in
1994
and
fanned
this
year
with
republican
attacks
proponents
of
tough
immigration
controls
sought
a
bill
that
covered
legal
as
well
as
illegal
immigration
they
figured
that
widely
popular
steps
to
fight
illegal
entrants
would
boost
lesspalatable
measures
against
legal
immigration
sen
alan
k
simpson
r
wyo
the
immigration
subcommittee
chairman
opposed
splitting
the
bill
his
proposal
would
cut
legal
immigration
now
at
an
annual
level
of
about
775000
by
20
percent
it
would
allow
us
citizens
to
have
their
spouses
and
minor
children
join
them
in
the
united
states
but
it
would
eliminate
immigration
options
for
siblings
and
most
adult
children
and
would
severely
curtail
immigration
by
parents
the
measure
covering
illegal
immigration
would
sharply
increase
funding
for
border
patrol
agents
it
also
would
establish
a
pilot
computerized
program
to
check
the
eligibility
of
people
applying
for
jobs
or
public
benefits
and
it
would
make
it
easier
to
deny
entry
to
foreigners
who
seek
us
asylum
but
do
not
hold
proper
documents
advocates
on
both
sides
agreed
that
the
vote
makes
it
difficult
but
hardly
impossible
for
some
legal
immigration
reforms
to
win
approval
this
year
a
parallel
bill
is
scheduled
for
debate
next
week
in
the
house
where
a
previously
defeated
drive
to
split
the
bill
will
be
revived
product
liability
house
republicans
have
dropped
their
demand
for
a
sweeping
rewrite
of
civil
litigation
laws
clearing
the
way
for
a
compromise
that
would
limit
damages
only
in
faultyproduct
cases
senate
moderates
prevailed
wednesday
in
limiting
a
bill
aimed
at
dampening
the
incentive
for
americans
to
sue
under
the
compromise
drafted
by
senate
and
house
negotiators
ceilings
on
damages
would
be
imposed
only
in
defectiveproduct
cases
the
much
broader
gop
contract
with
america
package
passed
by
the
house
last
year
would
have
limited
punitive
damage
awards
in
all
civil
lawsuits
including
medical
malpractice
cases
the
compromise
closely
tracks
a
narrower
senate
measure
that
passed
by
6137
in
may
judges
could
override
the
statutory
limits
on
punitive
damages
designed
to
punish
wrongdoing
but
defendants
in
those
cases
also
would
get
automatic
rights
to
a
new
trial
juries
hearing
faultyproducts
cases
could
grant
a
maximum
punitive
damage
award
of
twice
a
claimants
compensatory
damages
economic
losses
and
pain
and
suffering
payments
or
250000
whichever
is
larger
it
wasnt
immediately
clear
whether
president
clinton
would
sign
the
compromise
which
the
senate
could
vote
on
next
week
clinton
had
threatened
to
veto
the
broader
version
that
was
pushed
by
senate
majority
leader
bob
dole
whitewater
probe
senate
democrats
and
republicans
squared
off
yesterday
over
a
gop
threat
to
move
the
whitewater
investigation
to
a
new
forum
republicans
failed
for
a
third
straight
day
to
end
the
impasse
holding
up
the
inquiry
sen
alfonse
m
damato
r
ny
said
wednesday
that
if
the
senate
whitewater
committees
authority
which
expired
last
month
was
not
extended
the
investigation
would
be
moved
to
the
banking
committee
damato
heads
both
panels
but
senate
minority
leader
tom
daschle
d
sd
said
the
transfer
is
prohibited
by
the
law
that
established
the
whitewater
committee
last
spring
senate
parliamentarian
bob
dove
disagreed
dove
said
that
since
the
banking
committee
previously
held
hearings
on
whitewater
which
fell
within
its
jurisdiction
it
could
legally
do
so
again
as
they
had
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
the
republicans
fell
short
of
the
60
votes
they
needed
to
end
debate
getting
51
fortysix
of
the
chambers
47
democrats
voted
no
with
one
absent
welfare
reform
a
highprofile
bipartisan
effort
by
the
nations
governors
to
break
the
deadlock
between
congress
and
president
clinton
on
welfare
and
medicaid
reform
all
but
collapsed
yesterday
the
turn
of
events
apparently
sets
the
stage
for
the
gop
majority
in
congress
to
push
through
a
bill
to
reform
welfare
and
medicaid
without
much
democratic
support
the
measure
would
then
almost
certainly
draw
a
presidential
veto
and
become
a
campaign
issue
the
breakdown
emerged
in
a
bit
of
political
theater
that
began
with
a
morning
news
conference
led
by
house
speaker
newt
gingrich
r
ga
at
which
a
bevy
of
republican
governors
announced
that
their
democratic
counterparts
had
agreed
to
a
detailed
plan
to
revamp
medicaid
and
welfare
they
said
such
a
bill
would
be
ready
for
house
and
senate
action
within
two
weeks
but
the
announcement
was
disavowed
by
the
three
democratic
governors
involved
in
the
marathon
negotiations
the
three
had
not
been
told
of
the
allgop
news
conference
democratic
govs
bob
miller
of
nevada
roy
romer
of
colorado
and
lawton
chiles
of
florida
said
in
a
joint
statement
that
the
announcement
was
unfortunate
and
extremely
premature
considerable
work
remains
on
the
proposal
the
statement
said
and
it
noted
that
there
had
been
no
discussion
of
much
less
agreement
on
linking
welfare
reform
to
medicaid
reform
lineitem
veto
congressional
negotiators
said
yesterday
that
they
had
reached
agreement
on
a
compromise
aimed
at
ending
a
yearlong
impasse
over
a
republican
bill
to
give
the
president
greater
power
to
eliminate
specific
spending
programs
approved
by
congress
sens
john
mccain
r
ariz
and
daniel
r
coats
r
ind
leading
proponents
of
the
lineitem
veto
said
they
expected
a
housesenate
conference
to
adopt
the
plan
next
week
the
measure
part
of
the
gop
contract
with
america
and
supported
by
president
clinton
and
past
presidents
allows
the
president
to
eliminate
individual
items
in
larger
spending
bills
currently
the
president
can
only
veto
a
spending
bill
in
its
entirety
and
cannot
target
specific
programs
for
elimination
the
bill
sailed
through
the
house
in
february
1995
and
then
emerged
from
the
senate
a
month
later
in
very
different
form
following
objections
that
the
house
version
was
an
unconstitutional
giveaway
of
congressional
authority
the
compromise
reached
yesterday
basically
accepts
the
house
version
the
president
singles
out
items
for
veto
and
returns
them
to
congress
which
has
30
days
to
decide
which
items
it
wants
to
restore
a
twothirds
vote
is
needed
to
overturn
the
presidential
veto
