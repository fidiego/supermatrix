of
thousands
took
to
the
streets
nationwide
saturday
in
protest
of
arizonas
new
immigration
law
during
international
workers
day
the
contentious
legislation
which
was
signed
by
gov
jan
brewer
more
than
a
week
ago
has
been
referred
to
as
draconian
by
immigration
advocates
as
they
said
it
would
mandate
racial
profiling
by
requiring
officers
to
request
legal
documentation
of
people
they
suspect
to
be
in
the
country
illegally
its
stringent
provisions
have
sparked
massive
criticism
and
incited
new
momentum
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
an
energy
immigration
activists
say
is
reminiscent
of
the
historic
proreform
demonstrations
of
2006
but
in
spite
of
renewed
mobilization
efforts
immigration
and
border
issues
experts
do
not
see
such
changes
to
the
immigration
system
coming
any
time
soon
federal
and
state
leaders
are
casting
the
national
discourse
on
immigration
reform
in
terms
of
border
security
political
observers
said
it
is
a
framing
some
feel
could
have
been
aimed
at
improving
the
chances
of
congress
tackling
the
issue
this
session
even
as
president
barack
obama
has
knocked
it
off
his
agenda
but
an
approach
which
immigration
advocates
urge
that
will
not
garner
a
more
humane
comprehensive
look
at
the
legislation
last
week
though
obama
signaled
a
lack
of
appetite
to
address
immigration
senate
democrats
revealed
a
framework
for
reform
that
would
boost
security
along
the
countrys
borders
before
providing
a
path
to
residency
for
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
country
according
to
national
news
reports
the
plans
were
the
latest
in
a
conversation
about
reform
that
have
entangled
the
issue
with
national
security
immigration
and
border
experts
said
but
the
connection
of
the
two
issues
is
the
very
reason
why
i
do
not
think
we
are
going
to
have
comprehensive
immigration
reform
this
year
said
tony
knopp
history
professor
emeritus
at
the
university
of
texas
at
brownsville
and
texas
southmost
college
the
violence
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
has
people
very
concerned
and
not
very
open
to
an
immigration
reform
package
at
this
time
but
if
you
successfully
frame
any
policy
as
part
of
national
security
there
will
be
a
greater
chance
of
passing
it
said
john
skrentny
a
sociology
professor
and
director
of
the
center
for
comparative
immigration
studies
at
the
university
of
california
at
san
diego
such
was
the
case
in
the
late
1950s
with
the
passing
of
the
national
defense
education
act
skrentny
said
for
years
people
believed
the
school
funding
was
a
local
issue
and
that
the
federal
government
should
not
get
involved
even
though
campuses
were
struggling
the
professor
said
that
changed
when
the
soviet
union
launched
its
first
satellite
ahead
of
the
united
states
spurring
the
country
to
finally
pass
the
act
once
you
put
the
word
defense
in
there
the
politics
of
it
just
changed
he
said
who
is
going
to
go
against
national
security
its
good
politics
similarly
border
issues
experts
said
arizona
framed
its
immigration
bill
in
terms
of
border
security
lawmakers
in
favor
of
the
bill
said
the
state
took
such
tough
measures
because
people
were
frustrated
with
illegal
immigration
and
the
flow
of
drugs
from
mexico
into
the
united
states
those
concerns
were
merited
knopp
said
as
drug
cartel
violence
in
mexico
has
escalated
and
there
is
a
concrete
fear
of
spillover
violence
but
there
were
also
other
underlying
factors
why
the
bill
was
pushed
particularly
the
bad
shape
of
the
states
economy
and
the
fear
of
cultural
change
from
such
a
high
influx
of
people
he
said
arizona
is
one
of
the
states
that
has
had
the
largest
mortgage
defaults
knopp
said
property
values
dropped
greatly
especially
in
phoenix
still
if
political
leaders
do
not
separate
national
and
border
security
from
comprehensive
immigration
reform
we
are
doomed
to
make
some
costly
policy
mistakes
said
tony
zavaleta
vice
president
of
external
affairs
at
utbtsc
case
in
point
the
border
wall
he
said
the
billions
of
dollars
that
we
spent
on
the
border
wall
could
have
been
invested
in
jobs
education
and
healthcare
besides
concrete
and
steel
in
washington
dc
congressman
solomon
ortiz
has
been
working
to
push
immigration
reform
since
december
to
him
the
issue
is
about
creating
a
mix
of
tougher
enforcement
but
also
humane
policies
that
do
not
break
families
apart
or
leave
educated
undocumented
students
without
a
place
to
go
after
graduation
he
said
i
am
not
saying
we
should
open
our
borders
but
lets
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
