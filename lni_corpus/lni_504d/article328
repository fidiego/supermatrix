when
it
comes
to
immigration
issues
news
stories
public
opinion
and
reality
clash
like
a
foggy
freeway
pileup
the
federal
government
has
stepped
up
immigration
enforcement
in
the
war
against
terrorism
but
cut
federal
aid
to
states
for
criminal
justice
costs
for
immigrants
in
california
many
people
are
outraged
over
a
new
law
granting
drivers
licenses
to
illegal
immigrants
yet
californians
rely
on
work
performed
by
illegal
immigrants
at
restaurants
hotels
farms
construction
sites
and
dozens
of
service
and
manufacturing
industries
likewise
a
bill
passed
last
spring
by
the
illinois
general
assembly
that
grants
instate
college
tuition
to
illegal
aliens
who
graduate
from
illinois
high
schools
they
had
attended
for
at
least
three
years
generated
its
share
of
criticism
before
being
passed
many
of
the
teenagers
affected
by
the
bill
are
the
children
of
workers
whose
cheap
labor
is
valued
by
employers
and
consumers
in
illinois
and
now
there
is
legislation
in
congress
supported
by
conservatives
and
liberals
that
would
grant
amnesty
to
nearly
500000
undocumented
farm
workers
without
any
effort
to
reduce
illegal
immigration
federal
immigration
policy
is
in
chaos
and
it
has
been
for
more
than
a
decade
the
reason
is
that
while
the
american
people
and
policymakers
might
disdain
illegal
immigration
they
dont
want
the
7
million
to
10
million
illegal
immigrants
in
this
country
to
stop
providing
cheap
and
readily
available
labor
many
business
interests
have
long
supported
leniency
on
illegal
immigration
issues
while
organized
labor
once
demanded
rigorous
government
enforcement
to
protect
american
jobs
while
businesses
still
want
more
immigrant
workers
organized
labor
now
supports
amnesty
bills
and
a
general
liberalizing
of
immigration
laws
the
reality
of
the
flood
of
immigrants
convinced
labor
that
if
you
cant
beat
them
organize
them
with
both
business
and
labor
now
supporting
increased
leniency
in
immigration
onesided
amnesty
bills
will
proliferate
when
ideas
such
as
amnesty
bills
and
drivers
licenses
for
illegal
immigrants
pop
up
the
reason
is
the
failure
of
federal
immigration
policy
in
1986
the
federal
government
devised
a
sensible
immigration
policy
called
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
a
bipartisan
product
that
acknowledged
the
realities
of
illegal
immigration
and
then
set
about
to
rectify
them
illegal
immigrants
who
had
lived
in
the
united
states
for
a
long
time
were
granted
amnesty
and
millions
took
advantage
of
it
the
aim
was
that
illegal
immigration
would
be
reduced
through
increased
border
enforcement
forgeryproof
immigration
documents
and
sanctions
on
employers
who
hired
illegals
the
amnesty
and
increased
border
enforcement
went
forward
but
implementing
legislation
to
fund
forgeryproof
immigration
documents
and
sanctions
against
employers
who
hired
illegals
never
succeeded
in
congress
so
the
economic
magnet
continued
to
draw
illegal
immigrants
the
current
amnesty
bill
by
sens
larry
craig
rutah
and
edward
kennedy
dmass
has
impressive
bipartisan
support
and
is
even
backed
by
house
speaker
dennis
hastert
rill
from
a
public
policy
standpoint
however
it
makes
no
sense
it
seems
the
american
public
and
lawmakers
have
given
up
on
devising
a
coherent
immigration
policy
