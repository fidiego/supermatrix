gov
rick
scotts
pledge
to
bring
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
to
florida
probably
wont
happen
but
a
house
committee
voted
thursday
to
bring
him
the
nextbest
thing
the
new
florida
immigration
reform
plan
would
require
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
a
person
who
is
under
arrest
or
is
the
subject
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
language
stops
short
of
arizonas
controversial
law
which
requires
police
to
determine
a
persons
immigration
status
whenever
the
officer
makes
any
lawful
contact
with
the
individual
to
critics
floridas
proposal
will
essentially
allow
for
the
same
type
of
racial
or
ethnic
profiling
that
they
say
is
the
inevitable
product
of
arizonas
law
but
proponents
say
florida
needs
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
to
ensure
the
nations
laws
are
followed
like
the
arizona
law
the
house
proposal
requires
all
employers
to
verify
employees
work
status
my
feelings
for
this
issue
and
my
passion
for
this
issue
is
not
just
for
the
rule
of
law
said
rep
william
snyder
rstuart
its
not
just
about
jobs
which
it
is
to
some
extent
its
about
what
weve
allowed
to
occur
in
our
country
snyder
didnt
have
to
sell
the
bill
too
hard
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
where
hes
chairman
and
where
republicans
outnumber
democrats
who
cast
the
lone
nay
votes
in
the
126
approval
snyders
bill
is
the
first
of
a
handful
of
immigration
measures
cropping
up
a
senate
bill
sponsored
by
miami
republican
sen
anitere
flores
will
be
voted
on
monday
but
it
doesnt
require
law
enforcement
officers
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
criminal
suspects
in
cases
of
reasonable
suspicion
instead
it
would
require
jail
prison
and
other
detention
officers
to
check
the
status
of
inmates
lawmakers
are
under
intense
pressure
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
an
issue
that
polls
well
except
among
hispanics
who
happen
to
be
a
prized
voting
bloc
in

scott
made
an
arizonastyle
immigration
law
a
cornerstone
of
his
primary
campaign
and
expects
the
gopled
legislature
to
deliver
a
bill
he
can
sign
