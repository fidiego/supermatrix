can
find
herself
listening
to
a
wrenching
tale
of
an
immigrant
seeking
asylum
fearing
everything
from
torture
to
death
if
returned
to
his
or
her
homeland
or
she
could
be

the
roughly
215
immigration

year
decided
an
average
of
more

1600
cases

about
350
cases
on

judges
around

it
appears
all
those
stories
and

files
are
starting
to
take
their
toll
in

study

this
summer

are
as

out

found
female

immigration
judges
ordinarily
do
not
speak
publicly

they
didnt
hold
back
with

researchers
one
judge
told
researchers
they
have
to
grovel
like
mangy
street
dogs
to
convince
top
immigration
officials
they
need
more
time
to

with
the
crushing

what
a
dismal
job
this
is
the
study
does
not
entirely
surprise
marks

of
the
national
association
of

shes
now
using
the
findings
to
push
for
longsought
reforms
to
the
system
including
a
proposal
for
the
immigration
courts
to
break
from

oversight
the
depth
and
the
severity
is
what
was
surprising

its
gotten
a

worse
a
lot
faster
immigration
courts
have
come
under
closer
scrutiny
in
recent
years
as
caseloads
exploded
across
the
country
the
number
of
immigration
cases
jumped
from
more
than
282000
in
1998
to
a
projected
385000
this
year
with
only
a
modest
increase
in
the
number
of
immigration
judges
northern
californias
immigration
judges
are
based
in
san
francisco
federal
appeals
courts
which
often
review
the
work
of
the
immigration
courts
have
grown
increasingly
frustrated
with
some
of
the
justice
dispensed
a
mercury
news
review
three
years
ago
found
a
san
franciscobased
federal
appeals
court
was
regularly
overturning
the
immigration
courts
in
the
most
important
immigration
matters
it
decided
a
spokeswoman
of
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
which
runs
the
immigration
court
system
for
the
justice
department
said
officials
are
aware
of
the
recent
study
and
working
to
address
its
findings
which
included
recommendations
to
provide
far
more
resources
to
immigration
judges
elaine
komis
the
eoir
spokeswoman
said
19
new
judges
are
being
hired
this
year
and
the
department
is
asking
for
28
more
judges
in
2010
and
during
a
weeklong
training
session
for
all
the
judges
earlier
this
month
in
washington
dc
one
segment
included
stress
management
but
the
findings
of
widespread
stress
and
burnout
in
the
study
are
cause
for
concern
among
immigration
rights
advocates
who
worry
that
frustrated
overworked
immigration
judges
are
too
often
giving
short
shrift
to
immigrants
in
their
courtrooms
experts
such
as
karen
musalo
a
hastings
college
of
the
law
professor
and
leading
asylum
lawyer
say
there
are
ample
numbers
of
judges
who
dont
deserve
sympathy
because
there
are
judges
that
just
shouldnt
be
there
but
musalo
and
others
say
many
judges
are
wellintentioned
but
overburdened
in
particular
department
pressure
to
push
judges
to
decide
immigration
cases
quickly
and
erase
backlogs
has
aggravated
the
tension
in
the
system
according
to
experts
were
driven
by
numbers
statistics
said
gilbert
gembacz
who
retired
last
year
as
an
immigration
judge
in
los
angeles
after
12
years
on
his
court
the
bean
counters
have
taken
over
bay
area
immigration
lawyers
recently
provided
the
san
francisco
judges
with
a
survey
of
their
performance
and
the
main
concern
in
those
findings
which
are
not
public
was
ensuring
judges
remain
patient
and
empathetic
to
the
rights
of
the
immigrants
a
lot
of
these
judges
appear
easily
frustrated
said
philip
hwang
who
runs
the
asylum
program
for
the
san
francisco
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
and
summarized
the
survey
the
ucsf
study
identified
asylum
cases
as
a
leading
cause
of
stress
for
the
immigration
judges
because
of
the
stakes
involved
and
the
limited
resources
to
fully
examine
asylum
claims
were
dealing
with
death
penalty
cases
in
a
traffic
court
setting

at

out

a
recent
day
earlier
this
month
as
the
judge
considered
the

down

more
routine
hearings
involving
deportation
matters
unfolded
in
the
courtroom
of
judge
lawrence
di
costanzo
who
plowed
through
a
calendar
of
cases
speaking
slowly
into
a
microphone
to
produce
recordings
of
the
proceedings
there
was
little
sign
of
stress
in
the
small
antiseptic
courtroom
but
most
of
the
hearings
were
routine
matters
far
from
resolution
for
the
judges
and
the
system
the
stress
comes
later
when
the
decision
is
made
on
whether
an
immigrant
can
stay
in
the
country
or
must
be
sent
away
