a
judge
in
new
hampshire
said
police
cannot
charge
illegal
aliens
with
criminal
trespass
dismissing
cases
yesterday
against
eight
aliens
and
ending
what
some
had
hoped
could
be
a
new
approach
to
tackling
illegal
immigration
in
his
written
order
judge
l
phillips
runyon
iii
said
immigration
enforcement
is
a
federal
duty
and
the
towns
of
new
ipswich
and
hudson
in
southern
new
hampshire
were
encroaching
on
it
the
criminal
trespass
charges
against
the
defendants
are
unconstitutional
attempts
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
enforcement
of
immigration
violations
judge
runyon
wrote
police
in
the
two
towns
had
pulled
the
aliens
over
on
traffic
stops
and
then
charged
them
with
criminal
trespass
after
they
could
not
prove
they
were
in
the
country
legally
the
trespass
law
says
someone
is
in
violation
if
knowing
that
he
is
not
licensed
or
privileged
to
do
so
he
enters
or
remains
in
any
place
lawyers
for
the
police
argued
that
local
authorities
werent
trying
to
enforce
immigration
law
but
rather
were
trying
to
protect
residents
from
people
who
had
no
right
to
be
where
they
were
judge
runyon
disagreed
arguing
the
case
essentially
was
about
immigration
because
the
state
was
asking
the
court
to
use
federal
standards
for
immigration
status
and
then
apply
a
local
offense
in
addition
to
what
the
defendants
would
face
under
federal
immigration
law
the
judge
said
the
series
of
penalties
the
federal
government
imposes
for
immigration
violations
are
so
complete
that
congress
meant
to
leave
no
room
for
states
in
immigration
enforcement
the
lawyer
for
some
of
the
illegal
aliens
said
the
decision
is
a
victory
for
immigrants
and
immigration
policy
now
hopefully
the
defendants
can
return
to
living
their
lives
normally
said
randall
a
drew
who
represented
three
illegal
aliens
not
all
of
the
illegal
aliens
charged
with
trespass
challenged
the
charges
but
judge
runyon
dismissed
the
charges
against
them
too
the
judge
said
his
ruling
doesnt
mean
state
and
local
authorities
cannot
play
a
role
in
immigration
he
said
federal
law
has
a
process
for
local
police
to
be
deputized
to
help
enforce
immigration
law
some
members
of
congress
think
thats
a
good
idea
and
have
introduced
a
bill
to
allow
local
police
to
detain
illegal
aliens
on
immigration
charges
and
deliver
them
to
immigration
authorities
judge
runyon
never
said
whether
new
hampshires
trespass
law
itself
would
have
applied
to
illegal
aliens
he
said
he
didnt
have
to
reach
a
decision
on
that
question
since
the
police
actions
were
illegal
for
other
reasons
some
of
the
defendants
still
face
charges
on
motor
vehicle
violations
for
which
they
initially
were
stopped
