a

utahns
gathered
at
the
capitol
on
tuesday
to
join
a
national
movement
to
push
for
federal
immigration
reform
members
of
religious
business
and
community
groups
asked
utahns
to
call
the
white
house
and
their
members
of
congress
to
push
a
reform
bill
sponsored
by
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
that
was
introduced
in
september
as
we
speak
thousands
of
families
are
campaigning
for
legislative
reform
said

volunteer
with
comunidades

immigration
reform
is
a
pressing
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
on
a
federal
level
today
aaron
tarin
an
attorney
and
member
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
said
many
americans
believe
immigrants
come
to
the
border
and
see
two
doors
one
marked
legal
immigration
and
the
other
marked
illegal
immigration
the
hinges
on
the
door
marked
legal
immigration
have
long
since
rusted
shut
and
the
doorknob
has
been
replaced
by
a
dead
bolt
for
which
too
few
hold
the
key
tarin
said
we
need
visas
to
grease
those
hinges
and
fix
the
broken
doorknob
and
doorbell
with
comprehensive
immigration
reform
organizers
said
they
realize
there
are
several
other
pressing
federal
issues
from
the
faltering
economy
to
health
care
reform
to
the
wars
in
afghanistan
and
iraq
however
they
said
that
president
barack
obama
has
promised
to
address
immigration
reform
we
are
going
to
hold
him
to
his
word
and
hold
him
accountable
said
isabel
rojas
program
coordinator
for
comunidades
unidas
she
said
she
realizes
some
of
utahs
delegation
will
never
support
the
immigration
reform
gutierrez
has
proposed
but
she
added
well
take
friends
wherever
we
can
find
them
