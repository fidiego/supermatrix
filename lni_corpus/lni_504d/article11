police
officers
in
new
jersey
must
now
notify
immigration
officials
about
any
undocumented
person
who
is
arrested
in
connection
with
an
indictable
crime
under
a
directive
issued
wednesday
by
attorney
general
anne
milgram
the
need
for
a
uniform
state
policy
on
notification
to
immigration
authorities
became
evident
after
a
man
identified
as
being
in
the
country
illegally
was
charged
in
a
recent
triple
homicide
in
newark
milgram
said
during
a
news
conference
some
counties
and
local
police
departments
do
it
all
the
time
some
sometimes
do
it
and
some
never
she
said
that
changes
effective
immediately
milgram
said
milgram
emphasized
that
the
directive
isnt
tantamount
to
a
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
it
also
prohibits
law
enforcement
authorities
from
inquiring
about
the
immigration
status
of
crime
victims
and
witnesses
she
said
adding
that
her
office
will
monitor
how
police
implement
it
several
local
police
officials
said
theyd
have
to
review
the
directive
before
commenting
if
its
an
attorney
general
guideline
well
certainly
follow
it
to
the
letter
of
the
law
as
we
do
with
other
attorney
general
guidelines
said
teaneck
detective
lt
dean
kazinci
immigration
officials
praised
the
directive
we
are
pleased
to
learn
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
decided
to
forge
a
statewide
collaborative
partnership
with
the
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
office
they
said
in
a
written
statement
state
and
local
law
enforcement
play
a
critical
role
in
ensuring
the
safety
of
our
communities
the
ice
office
said
during
the
course
of
daily
duties
they
often
encounter
foreignborn
criminals
and
immigration
violators
who
pose
a
threat
not
only
to
national
security
but
also
to
public
safety
scott
weber
the
field
office
director
for
ice
in
newark
said
the
agency
is
prepared
for
an
increased
workload
stemming
from
the
directive
we
can
handle
it
he
said
such
a
directive
very
likely
would
have
kept
jose
carranza
one
of
several
people
charged
in
the
aug
4
killings
of
three
newark
college
students
behind
bars
after
previous
charges
for
child
rape
and
aggravated
assault
milgram
said
carranza
from
peru
had
been
free
on
bail
when
the
slayings
occurred
essex
county
authorities
said
they
were
unaware
of
his
status
at
the
time
of
the
two
earlier
arrests
but
they
also
said
their
policy
had
been
to
notify
immigration
authorities
only
after
a
conviction
not
an
arrest
this
is
not
about
immigration
its
about
crimes
milgram
said
during
an
interview
after
the
news
conference
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
foremost
question
is
a
public
safety
question
illegal
immigrants
suspected
of
serious
crimes
can
be
a
flight
risk
the
attorney
general
said
immigration
officials
have
the
power
to
detain
an
illegal
immigrant
based
on
the
civil
violation
of
being
in
the
united
states
unlawfully
pending
the
prosecution
of
criminal
charges
you
want
to
make
sure
the
federal
government
knows
and
the
county
and
local
prosecutors
know
a
suspects
immigration
status
milgram
said
its
relevant
to
bail
considerations
whether
an
individual
has
sufficient
ties
to
the
community
wednesdays
directive
requires
that
police
check
the
citizenship
nationality
and
immigration
status
of
suspects
during
the
booking
process
for
charges
linked
to
serious
crimes
and
for
driving
while
intoxicated
an
officer
who
finds
or
suspects
illegal
status
must
contact
immigration
officials
as
well
as
the
prosecuting
agency
and
the
courts
in
the
2005
and
2006
fiscal
years
ice
received
roughly
7400
inquiries
about
immigration
status
from
new
jersey
law
enforcement
authorities
said
ice
spokesman
michael
gilhooly
so
far
this
year
that
number
has
risen
to
9400
he
said
ice
has
been
trying
to
deepen
its
connections
to
local
county
and
state
law
enforcement
authorities
through
a
federal
program
that
deputizes
police
to
enforce
immigration
laws
so
far
only
morristown
has
applied
to
be
admitted
into
the
program
which
is
opposed
by
immigration
advocates
who
fear
it
could
lead
to
civil
rights
abuses
against
immigrants
milgram
said
any
town
admitted
into
the
program
must
implement
it
within
the
guidelines
of
her
directive
this
could
make
for
an
interesting
battle
although
he
said
it
said
it
was
about
time
new
jersey
does
something
like
this
morristown
mayor
donald
cresitello
said
he
didnt
believe
milgram
could
restrict
his
officers
actions
she
might
have
authority
to
tell
my
police
what
they
could
do
as
local
police
but
not
when
theyre
working
as
federal
deputized
agents
the
mayor
said
emphasizing
that
he
would
fight
any
restrictions
that
he
opposed
milgram
responded
that
the
directive
would
supersede
federal
guidelines
because
new
jersey
law
enforcement
comes
first
and
foremost
under
her
authority
some
local
police
said
theyve
asked
for
proof
of
citizenship
status
from
people
arrested
for
major
crimes
such
as
robbery
and
murder
although
not
necessarily
for
drunken
driving
paramus
deputy
police
chief
richard
cary
said
there
already
is
a
question
on
the
departments
standard
arrest
form
about
immigration
status
and
that
officers
ask
suspects
in
serious
criminal
cases
whether
they
are
us
citizens
and
have
the
documentation
to
prove
it
however
he
said
that
question
currently
isnt
part
of
the
standard
procedure
for
processing
dui
suspects
we
do
notify
immigration
officials
as
to
the
status
cary
said
what
they
do
with
it
is
up
to
their
office
some
police
said
they
wished
immigration
officials
would
more
consistently
respond
to
their
calls
too
often
they
said
immigration
authorities
seem
too
busy
i
would
like
to
see
them
intervene
immediately
said
clifton
police
capt
robert
rowan
charles
goldstein
of
the
new
jersey
immigration
policy
network
meanwhile
expressed
concern
that
police
might
abuse
their
new
authority
in
the
absence
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
these
directives
are
unavoidable
he
said
but
what
is
crucial
is
that
this
not
be
utilized
for
false
arrests
and
that
this
not
lead
to
creeping
racial
problems
the
ongoing
monitoring
by
the
state
will
be
crucial
