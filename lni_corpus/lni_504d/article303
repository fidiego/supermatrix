deportation
officers
will
comb
the
bay
area
starting
next
month
as
part
of
a
nationwide
effort
to
arrest
immigrants
who
have
ignored
orders
to
leave
the
country
an
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
official
said
thursday
fugitive
operations
within
the
immigration
service
are
getting
more
money
to
target
some
560000
people
nationwide
including
about
30000
in
the
bay
area
who
have
violated
deportation
orders
said
timothy
aitken
deputy
director
of
the
agencys
san
francisco
field
office
its
all
part
of
the
interior
enforcement
plan
that
we
have
here
aitken
said
you
cant
have
a
strong
border
enforcement
and
not
have
interior
enforcement
the
department
of
homeland
security
got
funding
about
a
year
ago
for
52
additional
fugitive
operations
teams
including
one
for
the
bay
area
and
another
in
bakersfield
aitken
said
the
sixperson
teams
are
forming
just
as
congress
considers
a
slew
of
immigration
reform
proposals
while
many
lawmakers
favor
increased
enforcement
at
the
border
and
inside
the
united
states
some
are
also
calling
for
a
plan
that
gives
undocumented
immigrants
a
legal
way
to
remain
in
the
country
and
eventually
become
citizens
as
the
debate
moves
to
the
senate
next
month
immigration
officials
are
stepping
up
enforcement
in
nearly
a
dozen
highimmigrant
areas
in
california
texas
florida
and
elsewhere
aitken
said
the
deportation
officers
first
target
immigrant
fugitives
who
also
have
criminal
records
the
fugitives
on
the
list
have
all
been
through
immigration
court
and
had
their
due
process
aitken
said
but
immigration
attorneys
said
that
the
agency
characterizes
people
with
minor
crimes
on
their
records
as
criminals
and
often
snares
their
friends
and
families
we
definitely
see
a
pattern
where
anyone
they
can
get
their
hands
on
they
will
said
angela
junck
an
attorney
with
the
immigrant
legal
resource
center
in
san
francisco
were
in
a
day
and
age
where
its
guilt
by
association
the
immigration
agency
has
had
one
fugitive
operations
team
in
the
bay
area
since
march
2003
since
october
the
team
has
arrested
321
people
and
in
the
year
before
that
they
took
1214
people
aitken
said
about
70
percent
of
those
arrests
were
people
with
criminal
records
in
addition
to
immigration
violations
not
all
of
the
immigrants
targeted
are
undocumented
you
can
have
somebody
who
immigrated
here
lawfully
and
then
they
get
a
criminal
conviction
and
based
on
that
criminal
conviction
we
put
them
before
an
immigration
judge
to
take
away
their
status
aitken
said
the
fugitive
teams
include
four
deportation
officers
a
supervisor
and
an
immigration
enforcement
agent
who
generally
works
with
jails
and
prisons
to
identify
deportable
people
several
proposals
before
congress
would
give
local
and
state
police
more
power
to
enforce
immigration
laws
and
some
police
departments
have
recently
signed
agreements
with
the
government
to
enforce
specific
immigration
laws
immigration
enforcement
officers
often
seek
help
from
local
police
when
searching
for
people
but
they
get
different
responses
in
different
cities
aitken
said
its
a
unique
dynamic
here
in
the
bay
area
he
said
its
not
as
it
is
in
other
cities
given
the
politics
of
the
area
in
concord
for
instance
police
notify
immigration
officials
only
if
they
have
someone
in
custody
for
a
serious
crime
and
suspect
he
or
she
is
here
illegally
they
have
their
task
and
we
have
ours
concord
police
lt
brian
wiesendanger
said
of
the
immigration
agency
concord
and
many
other
police
departments
are
hesitant
to
cooperate
with
immigration
officials
because
of
the
chilling
effect
it
could
have
on
solving
local
crimes
we
want
the
hispanic
community
to
feel
comfortable
reporting
crimes
to
us
and
we
dont
want
them
to
feel
that
theres
going
to
be
any
negative
consequences
for
doing
that
wiesendanger
said
one
former
immigration
official
said
the
us
needs
comprehensive
immigration
reforms
and
should
consider
a
guest
worker
program
but
that
catching
immigrants
who
have
flouted
the
law
should
remain
a
priority
enforcing
deportation
orders
is
a
matter
of
principle
said
victor
cerda
who
was
the
agencys
acting
director
of
detention
and
removal
until
he
stepped
down
in
july
to
work
on
immigration
policy
at
a
washington
dc
law
firm
we
are
a
nation
of
immigrants
but
were
also
a
nation
of
laws
