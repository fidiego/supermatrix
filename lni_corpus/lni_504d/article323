the
federal
government
will
soon
grant
a
group
of
virginia
state
police
officers
the
power
to
enforce
immigration
law
making
the
state
the
third
in
the
country
to
adopt
the
practice
since
the
attacks
of
sept
11
2001
local
officials
said
the
tentative
agreement
between
the
us
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
virginia
state
police
permissible
under
a
1996
law
is
part
of
a
movement
across
the
country
to
grant
local
law
enforcement
officials
more
authority
to
detain
illegal
immigrants
proponents
say
the
expanded
powers
will
give
police
more
tools
to
combat
terrorism
gang
violence
and
other
crimes
but
immigrant
advocates
counter
that
the
practice
could
lead
to
ethnic
profiling
and
some
police
officials
including
dc
police
chief
charles
h
ramsey
are
openly
opposed
to
the
idea
and
say
it
could
discourage
immigrants
from
reporting
crimes
the
debate
illustrates
the
complexity
of
improving
security
in
a
country
that
is
home
to
an
estimated
8
million
or
more
illegal
immigrants
three
of
the
19
hijackers
in
the
sept
11
attacks
were
part
of
that
underground
population
but
so
are
millions
of
workers
and
families
in
communities
across
america
homeland
security
which
enforces
immigration
laws
acknowledges
that
it
does
not
have
enough
agents
to
track
down
all
those
undocumented
immigrants
virginia
officials
decided
to
seek
extra
immigration
powers
for
some
state
police
officers
after
participating
in
local
and
federal
task
forces
on
terrorism
and
gang
violence
we
had
this
recurring
discussion
about
our
inability
at
some
times
to
deal
with
illegal
immigrants
when
we
were
involved
in
other
types
of
investigations
said
col
steven
flaherty
superintendent
of
virginias
state
police
while
the
police
had
worked
with
federal
immigration
authorities
over
the
years
he
said
their
resources
are
limited
as
well
so
you
dont
always
have
them
available
to
you
until
recently
local
and
state
police
could
not
make
arrests
on
civil
immigration
violations
although
they
could
detain
immigrants
for
criminal
offenses
and
sometimes
helped
federal
immigration
authorities
with
transportation
or
security
but
a
provision
of
a
1996
law
allows
federal
authorities
to
deputize
local
or
state
police
to
enforce
immigration
law
flaherty
said
he
and
other
officials
discovered
that
two
other
states
florida
and
alabama
had
sent
dozens
of
state
police
officers
to
be
trained
in
immigration
enforcement
under
the
federal
program
since
the
sept
11
attacks
virginia
then
contacted
homeland
security
to
do
the
same
michael
j
garcia
who
oversees
immigration
enforcement
for
homeland
security
said
federal
authorities
were
not
urging
state
police
to
receive
the
training
but
were
happy
to
provide
it
if
asked
so
far
he
said
the
program
has
worked
well
if
you
look
at
our
resources
we
are
limited
its
been
i
think
helpful
to
have
additional
people
out
there
who
are
skilled
in
it
and
who
can
do
the
enforcement
of
immigration
law
he
said
obviously
we
watch
to
see
thats
being
done
appropriately
under
the
agreement
being
negotiated
about
50
virginia
state
police
officers
would
be
able
to
enforce
federal
immigration
law
in
addition
to
their
other
responsibilities
flaherty
said
the
officers
would
be
stationed
throughout
the
state
with
one
attached
to
each
of
the
24
drug
task
forces
in
virginia
he
said
they
would
be
under
the
supervision
of
federal
authorities
when
carrying
out
immigration
enforcement
flaherty
said
the
officers
who
may
begin
training
as
early
as
next
month
would
use
their
immigration
authority
only
in
special
cases
were
not
going
to
plan
any
sweeps
of
illegal
immigrants
and
whatnot
we
just
want
this
tool
to
use
in
other
cases
he
said
in
addition
to
participating
in
the
homeland
security
program
virginia
recently
passed
a
law
that
would
permit
state
and
local
police
to
arrest
immigrants
who
were
back
in
the
country
after
having
been
convicted
of
felonies
and
deported
the
sponsor
of
the
house
measure
del
david
b
albo
rfairfax
said
that
fighting
terrorism
was
the
original
motivation
for
introducing
the
legislation
but
that
it
might
ultimately
be
more
useful
in
combating
gang
violence
both
the
new
law
and
the
homeland
security
program
for
state
police
will
likely
result
in
only
a
small
number
of
arrests
but
immigrant
advocates
are
concerned
that
the
measures
could
lead
to
officers
mistakenly
detaining
people
who
are
here
legally
quite
frankly
immigration
law
is
pretty
complicated
said
judy
golub
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
noting
that
there
are
myriad
visas
and
permits
allowing
people
to
stay
in
the
country
she
pointed
to
a
case
that
occurred
in
1997
when
immigration
agents
and
local
police
arrested
more
than
400
people
in
chandler
ariz
in
an
operation
targeting
illegal
immigrants
some
of
those
detained
turned
out
to
be
legal
residents
the
arizona
attorney
generals
office
later
concluded
that
the
sweep
violated
residents
civil
rights
and
the
city
settled
two
lawsuits
for
more
than
500000
jorge
figueredo
executive
director
of
the
hispanic
committee
of
virginia
a
communityservice
organization
based
in
falls
church
said
he
was
especially
worried
about
the
state
law
that
allows
police
to
arrest
immigrant
felons
who
have
reentered
the
country
after
deportation
the
most
important
question
is
how
are
they
going
to
do
it
he
asked
how
are
they
going
to
know
who
fits
those
qualifications
albo
agreed
that
the
law
would
be
difficult
to
enforce
noting
that
police
cannot
directly
access
the
relevant
immigration
information
because
it
is
spread
among
various
federal
databases
but
he
said
he
hoped
that
police
officers
could
eventually
call
up
such
data
on
the
computers
in
their
patrol
cars
allowing
them
to
enforce
immigration
law
in
the
course
of
their
work
the
virginia
law
follows
a
legal
tradition
in
which
states
could
authorize
their
police
to
enforce
criminal
rather
than
civil
immigration
violations
said
bo
cooper
former
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
who
now
works
at
paul
hastings
janofsky
walker
such
violations
include
reentering
the
country
after
being
deported
the
movement
to
expand
police
authority
to
combat
illegal
immigration
goes
beyond
a
handful
of
states
in
congress
rep
charles
whitlow
norwood
jr
rga
has
introduced
the
clear
act
which
would
give
state
and
local
law
enforcement
authorities
the
power
to
routinely
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
the
bill
has
120
cosponsors
a
similar
measure
has
been
introduced
in
the
senate
police
and
local
officials
nationwide
have
been
sharply
divided
over
the
idea
ramsey
called
a
news
conference
in
july
to
affirm
that
district
police
would
continue
their
longtime
policy
of
not
asking
people
about
their
immigration
status
unless
they
were
suspected
of
crimes
and
montgomery
county
executive
douglas
m
duncan
d
wrote
to
sen
barbara
a
mikulski
dmd
last
fall
to
urge
her
to
oppose
the
clear
act
a
troubling
consequence
of
this
legislation
is
that
it
could
cause
members
of
certain
groups
not
to
report
crimes
or
to
come
forward
with
information
about
crimes
for
fear
of
being
deported
he
wrote
some
authorities
have
also
said
that
their
police
departments
do
not
have
the
resources
to
take
on
immigration
responsibilities
nobody
expects
federal
immigration
officers
to
make
drunkendriving
stops
so
they
shouldnt
expect
local
police
to
make
federal
immigration
stops
