washington
a
senior
republican
senator
said
friday
that
the
approaching
political
debate
about
an
immigration
overhaul
should
take
into
account
the
revelation
that
the
suspects
in
the
boston
marathon
bombing
had
apparently
emigrated
to
the
united
states
from
kyrgyzstan
senator
charles
e
grassley
of
iowa
the
most
senior
republican
on
the
senate
judiciary
committee
opened
a
hearing
on
immigration
legislation
by
stressing
the
issues
importance
particularly
in
light
of
all
thats
happening
in
massachusetts
right
now
and
over
the
last
week
given
the
events
of
this
week
its
important
for
us
to
understand
the
gaps
and
loopholes
in
our
immigration
system
mr
grassley
said
in
his
opening
statement
while
we
dont
yet
know
the
immigration
status
of
people
who
have
terrorized
the
communities
in
massachusetts
when
we
find
out
it
will
help
shed
light
on
the
weaknesses
of
our
system
fridays
hearing
was
expected
to
offer
an
early
glimpse
into
how
the
senate
would
react
to
immigration
legislation
that
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
introduced
this
week
instead
it
was
overshadowed
by
developments
in
the
boston
bombing
case
which
also
affected
the
meeting
directly
when
the
homeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
who
was
scheduled
to
testify
before
the
committee
on
border
security
and
enforcement
had
to
cancel
her
appearance
to
oversee
her
departments
involvement
in
the
investigation
according
to
homeland
security
officials
one
suspect
dzhokhar
a
tsarnaev
19
who
was
captured
friday
night
arrived
in
the
united
states
in
2002
and
remained
as
part
of
an
asylum
claim
by
his
father
his
brother
tamerlan
tsarnaev
26
who
was
killed
friday
arrived
in
that
period
but
applied
for
asylum
around
2005how
can
individuals
evade
authorities
and
plan
such
attacks
on
our
soil
mr
grassley
asked
how
can
we
beef
up
security
checks
on
people
who
wish
to
enter
the
us
senator
charles
e
schumer
democrat
of
new
york
and
a
member
of
the
bipartisan
group
behind
the
legislation
urged
caution
about
linking
the
bombings
to
flaws
in
the
countrys
immigration
system
before
i
get
to
the
bill
id
like
to
ask
that
all
of
us
not
jump
to
conclusions
regarding
the
events
in
boston
or
try
to
conflate
those
events
with
this
legislation
mr
schumer
said
in
general
we
are
a
safer
country
when
law
enforcement
knows
who
was
here
has
their
fingerprints
photos
etc
has
conducted
background
checks
and
no
longer
needs
to
look
at
needles
through
haystacks
referring
to
the
legal
immigration
program
that
the
brothers
most
likely
used
mr
schumer
added
both
the
refugee
program
and
the
asylum
program
have
been
significantly
strengthened
in
the
past
five
years
such
that
we
are
much
more
careful
about
screening
people
and
determining
who
should
and
should
not
be
coming
into
the
country
the
hearing
formally
kicked
off
consideration
of
a
plan
that
would
increase
border
security
and
would
quickly
legalize
many
of
the
11
million
unauthorized
immigrants
in
the
united
states
eventually
offering
them
a
path
to
full
citizenship
opponents
of
the
plan
and
conservative
pundits
have
already
cited
the
boston
bombings
as
a
reason
to
move
slowly
but
mr
grassley
received
a
rebuke
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
senators
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
and
john
mccain
of
arizona
both
republicans
and
members
of
the
bipartisan
group
released
a
statement
friday
afternoon
urging
their
colleagues
and
the
public
not
to
link
the
boston
bombings
with
an
overhaul
of
the
nations
immigration
laws
some
have
already
suggested
that
the
circumstances
of
this
terrible
tragedy
are
justification
for
delaying
or
stopping
entirely
the
effort
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
the
joint
statement
read
in
fact
the
opposite
is
true
immigration
reform
will
strengthen
our
nations
security
by
helping
us
identify
exactly
who
has
entered
our
country
and
who
has
left
a
basic
function
of
government
that
our
broken
immigration
system
is
incapable
of
accomplishing
today
senator
patrick
j
leahy
democrat
of
vermont
and
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
similarly
said
he
did
not
think
the
boston
bombings
should
affect
the
legislation
if
we
change
the
policies
of
this
country
every
time
something
happens
whether
its
oklahoma
city
911
this
then
were
never
going
to
do
anything
he
said
after
the
hearing
the
connection
between
the
boston
attacks
and
the
immigration
debate
is
still
tenuous
if
early
reports
that
the
suspects
came
into
the
country
legally
prove
correct
that
could
undermine
attempts
by
opponents
to
link
the
bombings
to
political
concerns
about
the
immigration
overhaul
still
backers
of
the
844page
legislation
who
include
president
obama
were
already
facing
a
delicate
task
in
trying
to
pass
it
in
the
next
six
weeks
to
succeed
they
need
to
navigate
issues
of
economic
fairness
border
security
deportation
and
charges
that
the
bill
would
inspire
a
new
wave
of
illegal
immigration
the
boston
bombing
not
only
injects
a
new
issue
into
that
debate
but
also
potentially
robs
the
president
and
lawmakers
of
some
of
the
momentum
to
overhaul
the
nations
immigration
laws
proponents
of
the
legislation
quickly
rejected
mr
grassleys
assertions
saying
that
no
connections
should
be
made
between
the
boston
attacks
and
the
immigration
overhaul
until
more
information
was
known
there
are
legitimate
policy
questions
to
ask
and
answer
about
what
role
our
immigration
system
played
if
any
in
what
happened
said
alex
conant
a
spokesman
for
senator
marco
rubio
republican
of
florida
a
chief
sponsor
of
the
immigration
bill
regardless
of
the
circumstances
in
boston
immigration
reform
that
strengthens
our
borders
and
gives
us
a
better
accounting
of
who
is
in
our
country
and
why
will
improve
our
national
security
frank
sharry
the
executive
director
of
americas
voice
a
group
backing
an
immigration
overhaul
criticized
mr
grassley
for
bringing
the
boston
attacks
into
the
debate
i
think
its
shameless
mr
sharry
said
boston
is
in
lockdown
the
situation
on
the
ground
is
fluid
and
the
ranking
minority
leader
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
is
exploiting
it
to
try
to
derail
a
piece
of
legislation
