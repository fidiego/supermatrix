congress
should
tackle
immigration
reform
now
section
opinion
length

words
its
becoming
clear
that
congress
will
not
reform
the
nations
badly
broken
immigration
system
this
year
with
midterm
elections
in
november
and
a
democratic
majority
timid
because
of
the
raucous
health
care
fight
congress
seems
in
no
mood
to
take
on
the
contentious
immigration
issue
that
keeps
the
current
system
in
place
the
one
that
has
allowed
12
million
illegal
immigrants
into
the
united
states
and
the
one
that
creates
an
underground
labor
supply
for
many
industries
including
agriculture
president
barack
obama
has
been
promising
immigration
reform
since
he
was
campaigning
for
president
and
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
told
nevada
immigration
activists
last
week
that
reform
was
on
its
way
but
reid
quickly
backed
away
from
that
commitment
saying
there
was
too
much
other
work
to
do
to
get
to
immigration
reform
the
inaction
by
congress
has
left
states
with
large
illegal
immigration
populations
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
their
own
some
like
arizona
have
enacted
controversial
policies
arizona
has
just
passed
a
measure
that
would
require
police
officers
if
they
form
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
someone
is
an
illegal
immigrant
to
determine
the
persons
immigration
status
illegal
immigration
is
a
federal
issue
and
congress
should
not
ignore
its
responsibility
in
this
area
immigration
reform
must
have
these
basic
elements
enhanced
border
security
to
limit
the
growth
of
the
illegal
immigration
problem
and
make
our
nation
safer
from
terrorists
intent
on
doing
damage
a
fair
guestworker
program
that
provides
a
reliable
pool
of
workers
to
industries
needing
foreign
laborers
an
opportunity
for
those
already
here
illegally
to
earn
legal
residency
if
they
meet
strict
requirements
including
paying
fines
and
showing
they
have
had
a
responsible
work
history
illegal
immigration
is
particularly
controversial
in
the
san
joaquin
valley
because
public
agencies
and
hospitals
are
picking
up
the
cost
of
the
large
number
of
people
here
illegally
the
difficulty
of
this
issue
shouldnt
be
an
excuse
to
finding
a
workable
solution
congress
must
have
the
courage
to
reform
the
nations
immigration
system
