in
one
of
the
most
extensive
immigration
frauds
ever
perpetrated
against
the
united
states
government
thousands
of
people
who
falsified
amnesty
applications
will
begin
to
acquire
permanent
resident
status
next
month
under
the
1986
immigration
law
more
than
13
million
illegal
aliens
applied
to
become
legal
immigrants
under
a
onetime
amnesty
for
farm
workers
the
program
was
expected
to
accommodate
only
250000
aliens
when
congress
enacted
it
as
a
politically
critical
part
of
a
sweeping
package
of
changes
in
immigration
law
now
a
variety
of
estimates
by
federal
officials
and
immigration
experts
place
the
number
of
fraudulent
applications
at
somewhere
between
250000
and
650000
lack
of
manpower
and
money
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
has
identified
398000
cases
of
possible
fraud
in
the
program
but
the
agency
admits
that
it
lacks
both
the
manpower
and
the
money
to
prosecute
individual
applicants
the
agency
is
to
begin
issuing
permanent
resident
status
to
amnesty
applicants
on
dec
1
and
officials
said
they
were
approving
94
percent
of
the
applicants
over
all
evidence
of
vast
abuse
of
the
farm
worker
amnesty
program
has
already
led
to
important
changes
in
the
way
immigration
policies
are
conceived
in
congress
for
example
recent
legislation
to
aid
immigration
by
refugees
from
the
soviet
union
was
modified
specifically
to
avoid
the
uncontrolled
influx
that
has
occurred
under
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
supporters
of
the
farm
worker
amnesty
argue
that
it
accomplished
its
principal
aim
of
insuring
the
nation
a
cheap
reliable
and
legal
supply
of
farm
workers
and
that
it
made
an
inadvertent
but
important
contribution
in
legitimizing
a
large
part
of
the
nations
illegal

population
1000

30

critics
point
to
cases
like
that
of
larry
and
sharon
marval
of
newark
last
year
they
pleaded
guilty
to
immigration
fraud
charges
after
immigration
service
investigators
alleged
that
the
marvals
were
part
of
an
operation
that
helped
about
1000
aliens
acquire
amnesty
with
falsified
documents
showing
they
had
all
worked
on
a
mere
30
acres
of
farmland
the
amnesty
for
farm
workers
was
a
lastminute
addition
to
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
which
sought
to
halt
illegal
immigration
with
a
twopart
strategy
under
a
general
amnesty
illegal
aliens
who
could
prove
they
had
lived
in
the
united
states
since
before
jan
1
1982
were
given
the
chance
to
leave
their
underground
existence
and
begin
a
process
leading
to
permanent
resident
status
and
to
stem
further
illegal
immigration
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens
was
made
a
crime
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
was
adopted
at
the
insistence
of
politically
powerful
fruit
and
vegetable
growers
in
california
and
texas
who
wanted
to
protect
their
labor
force
in
several
respects
the
provisions
for
the
program
were
much
less
strict
than
the
general
amnesty
program
which
drew
17
million
applicants
instead
of
having
to
document
nearly
five
years
of
continuous
residence
most
agricultural
worker
applicants
had
to
show
only
that
they
had
done
90
days
of
farm
work
between
may
1
1985
and
may
1
1986
representative
charles
e
schumer
a
brooklyn
democrat
who
was
an
author
of
this
special
agricultural
worker
provision
said
that
in
retrospect
the
program
seemed
too
open
and
susceptible
to
fraud
but
he
argued
that
budget
decisions
had
made
the
battle
to
combat
fraud
more
difficult
there
has
not
been
enough
diligence
in
tracking
down
the
fraud
he
said
because
funding
for
the
ins
has
been
cut
by
the
white
house
in
each
of
the
last
three
budgets
even
though
everyone
agreed
when
the
bill
passed
that
greater
ins
manpower
was
essential
to
make
it
work
congress
rarely
raises
the
immigration
service
budget
above
administration
requests
aside
from
its
budget
problems
the
immigration
service
has
repeatedly
come
under
fire
this
year
in
congress
and
in
an
audit
by
the
justice
department
for
what
was
termed
mismanagement
and
administrative
inefficiency
john
f
shaw
assistant
immigration
commissioner
agreed
that
manpower
restrictions
at
the
agency
were
a
major
factor
in
the
fraud
in
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
he
said
much
of
the
fraud
shot
through
a
window
of
opportunity
when
the
agency
was
frantically
trying
to
deal
with
many
new
burdens
of
the
1986
immigration
law
people
who
sold
false
documents
mr
shaw
said
lawenforcement
efforts
had
been
limited
to
the
people
who
sold
false
documents
to
applicants
for
the
farm
worker
amnesty
the
immigration
service
has
made
844
arrests
and
won
413
convictions
in
cases
alleging
fraud
in
the
amnesty
program
the
people
involved
ranged
from
notaries
public
to
field
crew
leaders
it
was
a
cottage
industry
mr
shaw
said
the
immigration
service
can
revoke
legal
status
if
it
finds
the
applicant
committed
fraud
but
even
this
effort
is
limited
only
applications
that
appear
linked
to
a
fraud
conspiracy
are
held
for
review
as
when
an
unusually
large
number
of
applicants
assert
that
they
have
worked
in
same
place
some
398000
aliens
have
fallen
into
this
category
since
the
application
period
ended
last
nov
30
but
it
is
likely
that
many
of
them
will
get
resident
status
mr
shaw
said
the
fraud
conspiracies
often
involved
farms
that
actually
did
employ
some
migrant
labor
so
it
is
frequently
impossible
to
separate
legitimate
from
illicit
claims
given
the
limited
lawenforcement
effort
no
precise
count
of
fraud
in
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
is
possible
but
some
rough
estimates
are
possible
based
on
information
from
the
aliens
themselves
an
extensive
survey
conducted
in
three
rural
mexican
communities
by
the
center
for
usmexican
studies
at
the
university
of
california
in
san
diego
found
that
only
72
percent
of
those
who
identified
themselves
as
applicants
for
farm
worker
amnesty
had
work
histories
that
qualified
them
for
the
program
a
similar
survey
conducted
by
mexican
researchers
in
jalisco
in
central
mexico
found
that
only
59
percent
qualified
but
fraud
alone
does
not
explain
why
the
program
produced
more
than
five
times
the
applicants
congress
expected
frank
d
bean
codirector
of
the
program
for
research
on
immigration
policy
at
the
urban
institute
in
washington
said
the
miscalculation
in
the
special
agricultural
worker
program
reflected
longstanding
difficulties
in
tracking
the
number
of
temporary
illegal
migrants
from
mexico
it
is
at
least
plausible
that
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
saw
applicants
had
done
agricultural
work
in
the
us
even
if
they
did
not
meet
the
specific
time
requirements
of
the
amnesty
mr
bean
said
it
was
a
weak
program
mr
shaw
of
the
immigration
service
and
other
critics
of
the
law
believe
there
were
more
fundamental
flaws
it
was
a
weak
program
and
it
was
poorly
articulated
in
the
law
he
said
unlike
almost
all
other
immigration
programs
which
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
applicant
the
farm
amnesty
put
the
burden
on
the
government
consequently
aliens
with
even
the
most
rudimentary
documentation
cannot
be
rejected
unless
the
government
can
prove
their
claims
are
false
stephen
rosenbaum
staff
attorney
for
california
rural
legal
assistance
a
nonprofit
service
organization
for
farm
workers
argued
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
structure
an
immigration
program
for
an
occupation
that
does
not
produce
a
paper
trail
he
noted
that
farm
workers
are
paid
in
cash
and
neither
the
employers
nor
the
workers
keep
detailed
records
immense
logistical
problems
you
can
argue
the
wisdom
of
a
farm
worker
amnesty
but
if
you
have
one
you
have
to
recognize
the
immense
logistical
problems
involved
in
producing
evidence
he
said
the
immigration
service
at
first
tried
to
apply
the
stringent
practices
common
to
other
immigration
programs
like
rejecting
applicants
with
little
explanation
when
their
documents
were
suspect
but
three
lawsuits
brought
in
florida
texas
and
california
over
the
last
two
years
forced
the
agency
to
follow
the
broader
standards
mandated
by
congress
the
burdenofproof
issue
arose
again
earlier
this
year
when
the
house
of
representatives
approved
legislation
that
would
have
made
any
person
who
could
prove
soviet
citizenship
eligible
for
political
refugee
status
a
legislator
with
a
powerful
role
on
immigration
policy
senator
alan
k
simpson
republican
of
wyoming
eliminated
the
provision
because
of
concerns
raised
by
the
farm
worker
amnesty
program
an
aide
said
mr
simpson
who
is
on
the
senate
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
and
refugee
affairs
substituted
a
series
of
specific
circumstances
that
had
to
be
met
for
a
soviet
citizen
to
be
considered
a
refugee
like
denial
of
a
particular
job
because
of
religious
beliefs
immigration
experts
believe
that
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
will
probably
color
policy
debates
over
other
categories
of
aliens
whose
qualifications
will
be
difficult
to
document
like
the
antisandinista
rebels
of
nicaragua
one
certain
product
of
the
agricultural
amnesty
program
representative
schumer
said
is
that
in
developing
immigration
policies
in
the
future
congress
will
be
much
more
wary
of
the
potential
for
fraud
and
will
do
more
to
stop
