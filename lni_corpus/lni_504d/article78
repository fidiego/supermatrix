the
united
states
spends
more
on
immigration
enforcement
than
on
all
other
major
federal
criminal
law
enforcement
agencies
combined
and
it
has
increased
that
spending
dramatically
over
the
past
quartercentury
according
to
a
report
released
monday
by
the
nonpartisan
washingtonbased
migration
policy
institute
the
report
immigration
enforcement
in
the
united
states
the
rise
of
a
formidable
machinery
found
that
the
us
government
spent
18
billion
on
immigration
enforcement
in
2012
that
is
24
percent
more
than
it
spent
collectively
for
the
fbi
the
drug
enforcement
administration
the
secret
service
the
us
marshals
service
and
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
the
spending
went
to
the
governments
two
main
immigration
enforcement
agencies
us
customs
and
border
protection
and
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
and
to
usvisit
a
fingerprinting
and
photograph
initiative
to
log
international
travelers
at
ports
of
entry
the
report
also
found
that
more
people
nearly
430000
are
detained
each
year
for
immigrationrelated
violations
than
are
serving
sentences
in
federal
prisons
for
all
federal
crimes
and
it
found
that
deportations
have
soared
from
30000
in
1990
to
nearly
400000
in
2011
taking
into
account
the
latest
ice
statistics
which
counted
409849
removals
in
fiscal
2012
more
than
44
million
people
have
been
deported
since
1990
the
reports
authors
said
today
immigration
enforcement
can
be
seen
as
the
federal
governments
highest
criminal
law
enforcement
priority
mpi
senior
fellow
doris
meissner
a
coauthor
of
the
report
said
in
a
statement
the
numbers
have
starkly
increased
since
1986
when
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
was
passed
marking
the
first
time
that
hiring
illegal
workers
became
a
crime
and
ushering
in
a
new
era
of
immigration
enforcement
spending
on
immigration
enforcement
was
then
only
onequarter
of
overall
federal
law
enforcement
according
to
the
report
since
then
the
united
states
has
spent
187
billion
on
immigration
enforcement
the
report
said
the
findings
are
likely
to
feed
the
debate
over
comprehensive
immigration
reform
to
some
they
signal
a
need
to
broaden
the
governments
approach
jon
feere
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
supports
stricter
limits
on
immigration
said
increased
spending
and
detentions
do
not
mean
that
the
government
has
been
inefficient
in
fighting
illegal
immigration
one
of
the
reasons
there
are
more
detentions
is
that
we
have
more
illegal
immigration
since
1990
