criticizes

on

unfortunately
the
claim
made
by
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
that
immigration
detainers
are
issued
only
against
people
ice
has
a
legal
basis
to
take
into
custody
is
false
nationally
between
2008
and
2012
at
least
834
immigration
detainer
requests
were
lodged
against
us
citizens
people
who
are
never
properly
the
subjects
of
an
immigration
detainer
the
maryland
data
also
showed
that
between
2010
and
2012
at
least
six
immigration
detainers
targeted
individuals
from
puerto
rico
who
of
course
are
also
us
citizens
these
incidents
seriously
undermine
the
claim
that
ice
only
issues
detainers
against
individuals
it
has
a
legal
basis
for
detaining
and
it
raises
critical
due
process
concerns
about
immigration
detainers
another
ice
spokesperson
claims
that
persons
targeted
by
immigration
detainers
are
dangerous
criminals
who
would
otherwise
be
left
on
the
street
that
claim
is
completely
undermined
by
the
data
which
shows
that
in
maryland
the
vast
majority
of
immigration
detainers
are
issued
against
persons
charged
only
with
traffic
violations
or
minor
offenses
the
same
is
true
nationwide
immigration
detainer
requests
are
issued
at
the
sole
discretion
of
a
single
administrative
officer
without
any
kind
of
review
and
therefore
they
cannot
substitute
for
a
proper
determination
of
whether
someone
is
potentially
dangerous
thats
what
courts
and
the
criminal
justice
system
are
for
state
and
local
facilities
are
holding
individuals
who
are
not
deportable
and
who
should
never
have
been
detained
in
the
first
place
because
local
law
enforcement
is
being
diverted
from
community
policing
to
do
ices

section
8
housing
while
you
are
espousing
about
how
terrible
it
is
that
rosedale
doesnt
want
lowincome
or
section
8
housing
you
should
look
up
hollander
ridge
just
saying
no
isnt
good
enough
nov
20
hollander
ridge
was
also
in
rosedale
at
pulaski
highway
and
62nd
street
it
was
built
as
housing
for
transplanted
innercity
folks
primarily
those
whose
homes
in
the
franklinmulberry
corridor
were
torn
down
for
the
highway
to
nowhere
it
consisted
of
a
highrise
apartments
and
town
houses
it
wasnt
long
before
this
lowincome
section
8
mecca
became
one
of
the
most
violent
crimeridden
areas
in
the
county
even
the
property
itself
was
being
destroyed
by
residents
who
lived
there
for
next
to
nothing
neighbors
moved
away
in
droves
property
values
plummeted
it
became
so
bad
that
eventually
the
entire
development
was
leveled
and
is
being
redeveloped
as
an
industrial
park
do
you
think
maybe
rosedale
is
tired
of
this
the
expression
is
once
bitten
twice

finding
support
for
lowincome
housing
in
reading
recent
articles
about
the
vote
by
baltimore
county
council
to
reject
state
funding
for
a
planned
affordable
housing
development
in
rosedale
i
felt
troubled
that
certain
unfounded
attitudes
toward
voucher
holders
prevailed
and
am
hopeful
that
there
is
an
increased
awareness
that
more
affordable
housing
is
needed
throughout
the
county
i
was
troubled
by
remarks
that
crimes
go
handinhand
with
voucher
holders
and
that
it
doesnt
matter
whether
section
8
occupancy
is
just
a
few
residents
or
many
more
the
community
will
be
inundated
with
crime
baltimore
county
council
poised
to
block
lowincome
housing
nov
18
reputable
research
groups
have
found
no
correlation
between
section
8
occupancy
and
crime
instead
they
find
that
households
who
would
rather
use
their
vouchers
in
a
safe
opportunityrich
neighborhood
very
frequently
have
to
use
their
vouchers
in
communities
that
already
have
a
high
rate
of
crime
my
hopeful
feelings
stem
from
comments
made
by
councilwoman
cathy
bevins
and
county
executive
kevin
kamenetz
after
the
vote
was
taken
kamenetz
council
sent
wrong
message
by
blocking
housing
project
nov
20
though
ms
bevins
and
mr
kamenetz
had
opposing
views
on
the
planned
development
she
said
that
the
administration
needs
to
figure
out
how
to
spread
affordable
housing
throughout
the
county
and
mr
kamenetz
said
that
affordable
housing
needs
to
be
accessible
across
the
county
and
that
he
is
exploring
a
variety
of
strategies
for
more
affordable
housing
possibly
including
a
law
that
prevents
housing
discrimination
against
people
using
vouchers
in
the
past
the
beyond
the
boundaries
program
helped
members
of
diverse
catholic
parishes
to
have
sister
relationships
which
was
very
helpful
in
breaking
down
stereotypical
barriers
more
things
like
this
today
are
necessary
not
only
in
baltimore
county
but
in
baltimore
and
in
the
whole
region
so
that
what
mr
kamenetz
says
he
is
exploring
will
have
the
broad
support
to
actually
happen
