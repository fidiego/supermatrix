feelings
about
immigration
run
high
but
with
any
hope
we
can
recognize
that
it
is
just
as
unfair
to
call
those
who
oppose
immigration

prefers
the
demagogic
approach
hernandez
ignores
the
failures
of
our
immigration
system
and
misrepresents
the
remedies
under
consideration
in
congress
hr
2202
the
immigration
in
the
national
interest
act
is
the
most
sweeping
reform
legislation
since
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
only
such
a
comprehensive
approach
is
adequate
to
meet
the
challenges
before
us
for
despite
the
claims
of
hernandez
and
others
all
is
not
right
with
our
system
of
legal
immigration
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
longest
sustained
period
of
high
immigration
in
our
nations
history
immigration
averaged
733000
per
year
in
the
1980s
and
a
whopping
113
million
from
1991
through
1994
these
figures
include
the
amnesty
granted
to
27
million
illegal
aliens
as
a
result
of
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
some
have
argued
for
a
pause
or
moratorium
on
all
immigration
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
society
to
assimilate
these
millions
of
newcomers
others
notably
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
chaired
by
barbara
jordan
recognize
that
legal
immigration
continues
to
benefit
our
nation
but
must
be
reformed
and
properly
regulated
to
serve
the
national
interest
hr
2202
follows
the
commissions
route
if
not
all
its
specific
recommendations
the
bill
would
admit
more
than
37
million
immigrants
over
five
years
keeping
america
the
most
generous
country
in
the
world
by
any
measure
this
is
a
historically
high
level
striking
a
balance
between
generosity
and
the
need
for
reasonable
limits
hernandez
recognizes
that
we
have
the
right
to
restrict
legal
immigration
but
suggests
that
it
appeals
to
americas
baser
instincts
to
actually
enforce
such
regulations
yet
america
besides
being
a
land
of
immigration
is
also
a
nation
that
like
all
others
must
ensure
that
levels
of
immigration
do
not
overwhelm
our
capacity
to
absorb
the
newcomers
much
of
this
concern
is
reflected
at
the
local
level
a
vast
majority
of
immigrants
settle
in
one
of
six
states
and
25
percent
go
to
california
alone
this
concentration
leads
to
higher
demand
for
education
and
other
social
services
employment
is
also
affected
ten
million
immigrants
have
been
admitted
since
1980
without
regard
to
their
level
of
education
or
skills
studies
by
george
borjas
and
others
demonstrate
that
such
high
levels
of
immigration
lead
to
job
displacement
in
specific
entrylevel
job
markets
hurting
the
economic
prospects
of
native
minorities
hernandez
complains
that
hr
2202
eliminates
several
familybased
admissions
categories
he
fails
however
to
disclose
that
under
the
current
system
more
than
1
million
spouses
and
minor
children
of
lawful
permanent
residents
are
in
a
visa
backlog
or
that
hr
2202
will
clear
this
backlog
in
five
years
by
doubling
the
number
of
visas
for
that
category
to
make
room
for
such
numbers
categories
such
as
adult
married
sons
and
daughters
and
siblings
of
us
citizens
are
eliminated
a
decision
that
was
not
lightly
made
but
setting
priorities
in
this
case
to
unify
the
nuclear
family
means
that
some
interests
will
not
be
satisfied
it
does
not
mean
that
the
priorities
are
nativist
hernandezs
claim
that
scientists
researchers
and
others
who
contribute
to
our
economy
will
be
unable
to
immigrate
is
mysterious
since
hr
2202
actually
increases
the
number
of
slots
available
for
highly
educated
and
skilled
immigrants
also
off
the
mark
are
hernandezs
comments
on
refugees
there
is
no
legislated
cap
on
refugees
the
administration
sets
a
number
each
year
hr
2202
seeks
to
get
congress
back
into
the
picture
by
setting
a
target
first
of
75000
then
of
50000
preserving
the
option
of
congress
to
increase
those
numbers
to
meet
unexpected
needs
this
is
not
as
critics
claim
a
50
percent
cut
in
refugee
admissions
the
state
department
has
formally
proposed
a
cut
of
nearly
20
percent
for
1996
and
has
suggested
further
reductions
in
future
years
leading
to
an
ultimate
figure
of
50000
the
target
in
hr
2202
therefore
reflects
a
consensus
on
the
likely
need
for
us
refugee
resettlement
hernandez
is
most
wrong
however
when
he
links
hr
2202
to
xenophobic
movements
of
the
past
this
bill
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
national
origins
quotas
enacted
in
1924
with
due
regard
for
history
todays
immigration
debate
must
focus
on
todays
society
and
our
needs
for
the
future
and
not
on
past
wrongs
hr
2202
meets
the
needs
of
today
and
of
the
future
but
if
it
is
not
enacted
more
drastic
proposals
may
gain
popular
favor
to
preserve
a
generous
and
sustainable
immigration
policy
for
the
next
century
reform
of
legal
immigration
is
imperative
