envision
the
2007
political
debate
about
immigration
as
an
iron
bar
on
the
far
right
sat
president
george
w
bush
on
the
far
left
sat
sen
ted
kennedy
who
is
now
deceased
then
bend
the
bar
into
a
horseshoe
shape
and
bring
bush
and
kennedy
together
then
ask
yourself
why
it
is
that
these
polar
opposites
view
the
immigration
debate
in
very
similar
terms
that
immigration
bill
was
written
just
like
the
stimulus
bill
at
the
white
house
said
margaret
orchowski
author
of
immigration
and
the
american
dream
battling
the
political
hype
and
hysteria
bush
and
kennedy
wrote
it
and
took
it
straight
to
the
senate
she
said
orchowski
is
a
congressional
reporter
who
specializes
in
immigration
issues
for
the
hispanic
outlook
magazine
she
spoke
thursday
to
the
dubuque
area
committee
on
foreign
relations
her
job
isnt
to
take
part
in
the
debate
but
to
report
the
issues
and
the
opposing
points
of
view
she
takes
keen
interest
in
those
republican
and
democratic
moderates
at
the
top
of
the
horseshoe
who
she
predicts
will
eventually
shape
immigration
reform
orchowski
said
kennedy
completely
altered
us
immigration
policy
in
1965
and
maintained
his
position
as
the
driving
force
in
immigration
law
until
his
recent
death
immigration
has
always
been
about
work
orchowski
said
even
most
of
the
colonials
came
over
as
indentured
servants
for
their
work
skills
no
one
gave
a
damn
about
their
families
that
philosophy
remained
pretty
much
intact
until
kennedy
shifted
the
focus
of
immigration
policy
as
a
civil
right
which
orchowski
said
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
the
1960s
immigration
was
always
written
by
the
labor
committee
and
that
all
changed
with
kennedy
in
1965
when
it
became
the
job
of
the
judiciary
committee
she
said
immigration
policy
not
just
in
the
united
states
but
everywhere
falls
prey
to
a
paradox
she
said
the
un
charter
says
that
every
human
has
a
right
to
leave
their
homeland
but
you
do
not
have
the
human
right
or
even
the
civil
right
to
go
into
any
country
because
you
want
to
it
is
the
core
right
of
a
nationstate
to
decide
who
comes
in
and
of
course
the
hard
part
deciding
who
cant
orchowski
said
she
said
bush
and
kennedy
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
horseshoe
for
different
reasons
bush
was
an
economic
globalist
seeking
to
ensure
cheap
labor
while
kennedy
was
a
globalist
of
a
different
sort
who
is
motivated
by
civil
rights
for
all
since
kennedys
death
she
said
charles
schumer
dnew
york
has
taken
the
lead
role
in
the
judiciary
committee
and
has
expressed
a
different
direction
for
immigration
reform
she
said
immigration
reform
does
not
appear
to
be
a
top
priority
