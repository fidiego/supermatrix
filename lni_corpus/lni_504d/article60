the
us
supreme
court
turned
aside
an
appeal
on
monday
from
the
state
of
alabama
asking
the
high
court
to
examine
whether
state
governments
can
pass
laws
making
it
illegal
to
harbor
or
smuggle
illegal
immigrants
within
a
states
borders
the
court
action
came
without
comment
from
the
justices
the
order
noted
that
justice
antonin
scalia
dissented
from
the
courts
decision
not
to
hear
the
case
the
denial
comes
as
congress
and
the
white
house
are
working
toward
an
immigration
reform
package
at
issue
in
alabama
v
us
12884
was
an
alabama
statute
that
sought
to
echo
the
requirements
of
federal
immigration
laws
that
outlaw
similar
activities
it
was
patterned
on
a
controversial
immigration
law
passed
in
arizona
in
2010
aimed
at
discouraging
illegal
immigrants
from
coming
to
or
remaining
in
arizona
while
alabama
argued
that
its
statute
was
substantively
different
from
those
portions
of
arizonas
law
previously
struck
down
by
the
supreme
court
the
justices
refusal
to
take
the
case
lets
stand
an
appellate
court
ruling
that
the
alabama
law
was
preempted
by
federal
immigration
law
eight
other
states
have
similar
laws
that
seek
to
regulate
activities
related
to
the
presence
of
illegal
immigrants
within
state
borders
they
were
adopted
in
an
attempt
to
compensate
for
what
state
officials
viewed
as
lax
or
ineffective
enforcement
of
us
immigration
laws
by
the
federal
government
like
it
did
regarding
arizonas
sb
1070
the
obama
administration
opposed
the
alabama
law
and
successfully
sued
the
state
in
federal
court
to
prevent
it
from
enforcing
any
statute
that
might
touch
on
issues
involving
illegal
immigrants
that
posture
toward
the
states
set
the
stage
for
a
constitutional
confrontation
pitting
the
authority
of
the
national
government
to
set
immigration
enforcement
priorities
against
the
power
of
the
states
to
protect
state
residents
within
their
own
borders
the
obama
administrations
crackdown
against
aggressive
state
immigration
laws
also
dovetailed
with
a
political
strategy
in
the
presidents
reelection
campaign
candidate
obama
used
the
statefederal
disputes
and
the
promise
of
a
kinder
gentler
immigration
posture
by
his
administration
to
appeal
to
latino
voters
it
worked
in
november
the
president
received
71
percent
of
the
latino
vote
last
june
the
supreme
court
invalidated
three
sections
of
arizonas
sb
1070
saying
they
were
preempted
by
federal
immigration
law
but
the
justices
also
upheld
the
laws
controversial
centerpiece
the
showmeyourpapers
provision
that
ordered
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
had
reason
to
suspect
were
in
the
us
without
authorization
the
question
in
the
alabama
case
was
whether
alabamas
antiharboring
statute
is
preempted
by
federal
immigration
laws
and
the
more
forgiving
immigration
enforcement
priorities
of
the
obama
administration
in
general
laws
passed
by
congress
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
thus
preempt
state
laws
that
either
intrude
into
an
area
of
federal
power
or
conflict
with
an
existing
federal
statute
the
portion
of
the
alabama
law
that
was
being
appealed
involved
state
prohibitions
on
harboring
inducing
the
arrival
or
transporting
illegal
immigrants
in
alabama
these
provisions
are
markedly
different
from
the
ones
this
court
invalidated
in
the
arizona
case
alabama
solicitor
general
john
neiman
wrote
in
his
brief
to
the
court
mr
neiman
said
that
rather
than
attempting
to
regulate
the
actions
of
the
illegal
immigrants
themselves
an
area
of
federal
authority
the
alabama
statute
sought
to
regulate
state
residents
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
that
was
related
to
illegal
immigrants
that
distinction
neiman
said
differentiated
the
antiharboring
law
from
the
portions
of
the
arizona
statute
struck
down
last
year
by
the
supreme
court
the
united
states
makes
no
attempt
to
justify
equating
laws
that
operate
directly
on
aliens
with
those
that
operate
on
citizens
the
alabama
solicitor
general
wrote
us
solicitor
general
donald
verrilli
urged
the
court
to
not
take
up
the
alabama
case
he
said
the
eleventh
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
correctly
when
it
decided
that
the
alabama
law
was
preempted
by
federal
immigration
law
mr
verrilli
quoted
the
supreme
courts
decision
in
the
arizona
case
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
broad
undoubted
power
over
the
subject
of
immigration
and
the
status
of
aliens
he
wrote
whatever
power
a
state
may
have
related
to
immigration
is
subordinate
to
supreme
national
law
washington
has
wide
discretion
in
every
area
touching
on
immigration
and
immigration
enforcement
he
said
the
federal
governments
exclusive
authority
to
regulate
the
terms
and
conditions
of
an
aliens
entry
movement
and
residence
in
the
united
states
includes
the
authority
to
establish
criminal
sanctions
against
third
parties
who
facilitate
an
aliens
violation
of
those
terms
and
conditions
and
the
authority
to
decide
whether
and
how
such
criminal
sanctions
may
be
imposed
the
solicitor
general
said
because
congress
has
occupied
this
entire
field
even
complimentary
state
regulation
is
impermissible
verrilli
wrote
he
said
the
alabama
statute
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
operation
of
federal
law
congress
provided
that
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officials
have
the
authority
to
arrest
individuals
for
violations
of
federal
immigration
law
but
it
is
up
to
federal
officials
to
decide
when
or
whether
to
prosecute
those
who
are
arrested
according
to
the
governments
brief
arizona
and
eight
other
states
had
asked
the
high
court
to
take
up
alabamas
appeal
they
are
colorado
florida
georgia
indiana
kansas
michigan
oklahoma
and
south
carolina
the
states
friend
of
the
court
brief
said
the
eleventh
circuit
went
too
far
when
it
ruled
that
a
state
law
with
any
connection
to
immigration
is
preempted
unless
specifically
authorized
by
congress
no
interest
is
more
fundamental
or
substantial
than
the
states
interests
in
protecting
their
residents
from
harm
the
friend
of
the
court
brief
said
some
criminal
organizations
profit
by
providing
the
means
for
illegal
entry
or
transport
or
a
safe
harbor
within
the
united
states
for
unauthorized
aliens
the
brief
said
other
organized
crime
groups
and
terrorists
exploit
immigrants
who
seek
to
come
to
or
remain
in
the
united
states
by
forcing
the
immigrants
to
commit
other
crimes
such
as
drug
running
or
prostitution
