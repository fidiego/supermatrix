thursday
afternoon
about
50
people
gathered
in
front
of
the
elizabeth
detention
center
where
some
300
foreign
nationals
are
held
on
immigration
violations
to
call
for
the
immigration
system
to
be
reformed
the
people
at
the
rally
which
marked
the
conclusion
of
a
march
that
had
begun
more
than
six
miles
away
by
the
federal
building
that
houses
immigration
offices
in
newark
called
on
congress
to
pass
an
immigration
measure
that
would
give
some
of
the
nations
12
million
illegal
immigrants
a
chance
to
legalize
their
status
they
held
posters
that
said
no
human
being
is
illegal
and
support
humane
immigration
reform
greg
sullivan
of
wyckoff
one
of
the
demonstrators
said
he
hoped
the
march
and
demonstration
would
help
raise
awareness
give
people
knowledge
about
the
injustices
that
exist
in
the
immigration
system
sullivan
is
director
of
the
interfaith
refugee
action
team
elizabeth
which
includes
a
program
in
which
volunteers
visit
people
held
in
immigrant
detention
facilities
with
no
friends
or
relatives
in
the
area
the
event
was
one
of
many
similar
ones
held
around
the
country
to
mark
international
human
rights
day
said
chiachia
wang
civil
participation
coordinator
for
the
newarkbased
american
friends
service
committee
a
coordinator
of
the
demonstration
todays
walk
and
rally
will
hopefully
demonstrate
the
different
communities
commitment
to
immigration
reform
said
wang
who
led
the
chanting
group
south
on
broad
street
toward
elizabeth
just
after
noon
immigration
reform
is
important
because
there
are
currently
about
12
million
immigrants
in
the
united
states
who
have
no
way
to
legalize
their
status
and
there
are
many
people
who
want
to
come
to
the
united
states
to
join
their
families
and
must
wait
a
very
long
time
because
of
delays
wang
said
president
obama
promised
during
his
campaign
that
he
would
push
for
legislation
that
would
tighten
enforcement
along
the
borders
as
well
as
provide
a
pathway
to
legalization
for
illegal
immigrants
who
meet
certain
criteria
including
no
criminal
record
efforts
to
learn
english
and
willingness
to
pay
a
fine
for
being
here
illegally
but
efforts
to
get
congressional
support
for
other
legislation
dealing
with
health
care
reform
and
stimulating
the
economy
have
put
immigration
reform
on
the
back
burner
frustrating
advocates
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
issue
immigration
reform
is
just
as
important
as
health
care
and
the
economy
said
wang
immigration
reform
should
not
be
put
aside
it
should
be
a
priority
with
the
other
issues
groups
that
favor
strict
immigration
enforcement
object
to
legislation
that
would
give
illegal
immigrants
a
way
to
legalize
these
groups
say
the
move
amounts
to
an
amnesty
that
rewards
lawbreakers
immigration
overall
legal
and
illegal
has
to
be
reformed
said
northvale
resident
ed
durfee
a
member
of
the
united
patriots
of
america
which
supports
strict
immigration
policies
were
overloading
our
country
with
people
who
dont
speak
english
were
losing
our
identity
and
our
culture
if
we
cant
control
our
borders
we
cant
control
our
future
david
toleda
of
clifton
has
another
view
toleda
said
hed
walked
in
the
bitter
cold
from
newark
to
elizabeth
to
show
support
for
the
day
laborers
of
passaic
it
is
not
right
that
people
who
want
to
legalize
are
afraid
are
living
in
hiding
and
many
of
them
have
children
who
are
americanborn
he
said
theyre
doing
lowlevel
physically
demanding
work
that
i
still
dont
see
americans
clamoring
to
do
groups
such
as
the
american
friends
service
committee
say
the
nation
will
never
be
able
to
deport
the
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
already
here
and
that
it
should
provide
a
way
to
let
some
of
them
legalize
their
status
they
argue
that
legalizing
them
would
bring
them
out
of
the
shadows
which
they
say
is
crucial
to
national
security
and
improve
the
economy
by
adding
more
people
to
the
tax
rolls
an
estimated
halfmillion
illegal
immigrants
