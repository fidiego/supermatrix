history
of
our
law
the
federal
immigration
office
was
created
in
1864
by
a
law
intended
to
encourage
immigration
that
was
repealed
a
few
years
later
leaving
the
immigration
authority
at
the
state
level
because
problems
arose
with
this
system
the
immigration
act
of
1891
was
passed
establishing
complete
and
definite
federal
control
over
immigration
beginning
with
24
inspection
stations
at
ports
of
entry
this
early
structure
was
the
foundation
for
the
immigration
side
of
the
current
ins
in
1903
the
bureau
of
immigration
was
moved
to
the
newly
established
department
of
commerce
and
labor
and
was
given
broader
responsibilities
the
naturalization
act
of
1906
set
the
stage
for
the
naturalization
role
of
ins
shifting
this
function
from
the
courts
creating
a
new
system
for
administering
and
enforcing
us
immigration
laws
and
supervising
the
naturalization
of
aliens
the
combined
functions
were
so
aligned
for
only
seven
years
naturalization
became
a
separate
bureau
again
in
1913
and
remained
separate
until
1933
when
an
executive
order
consolidated
the
functions
under
the
ins
within
the
labor
department
in
1940
circa
wwii
the
ins
moved
to
the
department
of
justice
in
a
reorganization
that
was
intended
to
provide
more
effective
control
over
aliens
1965
and
forward
immigration
policy
was
significantly
revised
in
1965
with
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
amendments
nationality
and
ethnic
considerations
were
replaced
with
a
system
based
on
reunification
of
families
needed
skills
and
recognition
of
refugees
in
1986
the
enactment
of
the
immigration
reform
and
