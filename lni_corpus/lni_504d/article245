5albuquerque
police
officer
ron
olivas
has
never
called
federal
immigration
officers
in
seven
years
patrolling
the
city
officer
ben
baker
has
called
once
in
his
10year
law
enforcement
career
and
apd
spokesman
john
walsh
has
called
twice
in
22
years
but
in
recent
weeks
determining
when
cops
should
call
federal
immigration
officers
has
become
a
hotly
debated
topic
among
elected
officials
community
leaders
and
the
public
for
example
albuquerque
police
issued
a
policy
for
its
officers
and
then
was
forced
to
reissue
it
after
a
flood
of
complaints
over
just
what
it
meant
republican
city
councilor
brad
winter
has
drafted
a
resolution
clarifying
a
previous
one
he
voted
for
in
2001
that
declared
albuquerque
immigrant
friendly
and
the
republican
party
has
made
thousands
of
phone
calls
accusing
mayor
martin
chavez
of
making
albuquerque
a
haven
for
criminals
and
urging
people
to
call
city
hall
meanwhile
the
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
checks
the
immigration
status
of
all
those
booked
into
the
west
side
jail
whether
albuquerque
police
calls
them
or
not
so
whats
the
point
its
a
very
hot
issue
right
now
police
chief
ray
schultz
said
in
a
recent
interview
its
a
very
confusing
issue
the
confusion
started
last
month
when
an
apd
policy
was
leaked
to
the
media
that
said
officers
shall
not
inquire
about
or
seek
proof
of
a
persons
immigration
status
even
if
an
arrest
is
made
for
nonimmigration
criminal
violation
schultz
said
the
policy
was
issued
as
the
result
of
a
settle
ment
stemming
from
a
may
2005
lawsuit
filed
by
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
the
lawsuit
alleged
that
the
police
and
albuquerque
public
schools
violated
the
civil
rights
of
three
high
school
students
by
seizing
and
detaining
them
at
del
norte
high
school
until
immigration
officials
could
question
them
under
the
settlement
apd
agreed
to
develop
a
policy
that
was
in
line
with
a
2001
resolution
that
was
unanimously
passed
by
the
council
winter
who
was
council
president
at
the
time
said
the
2001
ordinance
was
passed
to
protect
witnesses
and
victims
of
crime
it
was
not
written
to
protect
those
arrested
as
he
claims
chavez
is
trying
to
do
with
the
new
policy
the
intent
was
never
to
protect
individuals
who
are
in
custody
for
crimes
he
said
schultz
said
he
realized
officers
didnt
understand
the
new
policy
after
some
complained
to
news
reporters
that
the
policy
meant
they
could
never
check
someones
immigration
status
within
a
few
days
a
reworded
policy
was
distributed
that
said
officers
shall
not
inquire
about
or
seek
proof
of
a
persons
immigration
status
unless
the
person
is
in
custody
or
is
a
suspect
in
a
criminal
investigation
for
a
nonimmigration
criminal
violation
and
the
immigration
status
of
the
person
or
suspect
is
pertinent
to
the
criminal
investigation
the
republican
party
and
winter
interpret
that
to
mean
officers
cant
call
immigration
officials
so
winter
drafted
a
resolution
that
would
allow
officers
to
call
immigration
officials
whenever
they
make
an
arrest
republicans
have
started
a
campaign
targeting
chavez
in
which
they
urge
residents
to
call
the
mayor
to
voice
their
displeasure
but
in
the
end
we
all
agree
schultz
said
our
officers
can
call
immigration
when
they
make
an
arrest
under
the
current
policy
officers
have
discretion
to
call
immigration
officials
when
they
arrest
someone
if
their
immigration
status
is
pertinent
to
the
investigation
schultz
said
for
example
he
said
if
someone
is
arrested
for
stealing
a
car
officers
can
check
the
suspects
immigration
status
if
they
believe
the
suspect
is
a
flight
risk
discover
the
suspect
was
born
outside
the
us
or
if
the
person
has
no
ties
to
the
community
officers
cant
call
just
because
someone
is
hispanic
schultz
said
we
want
officers
to
have
an
articulate
reason
to
call
we
dont
want
them
to
run
them
just
because
of
their
last
name
we
want
the
officers
to
decide
when
it
is
appropriate
if
an
officer
doesnt
know
if
its
appropriate
to
call
ins
the
officer
can
always
call
a
supervisor
schultz
said
olivas
said
most
cops
dont
want
a
policy
that
restricts
them
on
a
daytoday
basis
we
dont
have
a
clue
what
we
might
run
into
what
we
have
to
do
and
what
resource
we
need
he
said
right
now
there
is
a
lot
of
political
turmoil
over
our
heads
speaking
for
the
cops
we
just
want
to
have
all
of
the
resources
available
to
us
to
keep
the
public
safe
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
spokeswoman
leticia
zamarripa
said
agents
regularly
obtain
a
list
from
the
jail
of
all
those
arrested
who
are
foreign
born
agents
check
the
inmates
immigration
status
and
place
an
immigration
hold
on
anyone
in
the
country
illegally
those
inmates
are
held
until
their
cases
are
adjudicated
