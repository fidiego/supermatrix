should
americas
illegal
immigrants
be
offered
legal
status
there
are
11
million
illegal
immigrants
living
in
the
us
with
midterm
elections
around
the
corner
the
immigration
reform
debate
is
heating
up
fueled
by
everything
from
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
to
the
14th
amendments
birthright
citizenship
clause
length
623
words
no
amnesty
is
wrong
and
costly
immigration
laws
exist
for
a
very
good
reason
excessive
levels
of
immigration
can
have
a
profoundly
negative
impact
on
the
receiving
society
there
is
no
aspect
of
american
life
jobs
wages
education
health
care
taxes
environment
to
name
a
few
that
is
not
affected
by
immigration
the
cost
of
amnesty
is
too
high
americans
already
bear
a
113
billion
annual
burden
from
their
governments
refusal
to
enforce
immigration
laws
millions
of
jobs
that
americans
want
and
need
are
filled
by
illegal
immigrants
willing
to
work
for
low
wages
amnesty
would
make
the
largely
poorly
educated
and
poorly
skilled
illegal
immigrant
population
eligible
for
costly
benefits
and
services
increasing
the
burden
for
american
taxpayers
and
paving
the
way
for
family
members
to
follow
them
here
amnesty
solves
the
illegal
immigration
problem
in
much
the
same
way
that
raising
the
speed
limit
to
150
miles
per
hour
solves
speeding
the
illegality
is
removed
but
the
detrimental
consequences
to
everyone
else
grow
worse
rewarding
lawbreaking
is
wrong
and
only
generates
more
of
it
we
granted
amnesty
to
some
3
million
people
in
1986
and
now
have
at
least
11
million
illegal
immigrants
in
united
states
instead
illegal
immigration
should
be
addressed
by
systematically
removing
the
incentives
that
draw
people
to
this
country
illegally
illegal
immigration
actually
declined
in
recent
years
as
people
reacted
rationally
to
the
recession
and
belated
efforts
by
the
bush
administration
to
enforce
immigration
laws
resuming
worksite
enforcement
eliminating
nonessential
government
benefits
and
services
enhancing
cooperation
between
local
and
federal
authorities
and
other
measures
provide
an
alternative
to
mass
amnesty
and
would
better
serve
the
interests
of
the
american
people
dan
stein
president
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
yes
legalization
is
the
only
realistic
solution
americans
are
justifiably
frustrated
that
11
million
unauthorized
immigrants
now
live
in
the
united
states
yet
the
majority
of
them
would
have
preferred
to
come
legally
there
was
simply
no
way
under
current
immigration
laws
moreover
most
of
them
are
working
paying
taxes
and
buying
us
goods
other
than
lacking
legal
status
most
are
lawabiding
residents
many
are
married
to
us
citizens
with
children
who
are
citizens
the
problem
is
that
they
are
often
willing
to
accept
low
wages
and
poor
working
conditions
which
creates
unfair
competition
for
us
workers
and
gives
unscrupulous
employers
an
unfair
advantage
over
lawabiding
employers
we
could
continue
on
the
same
path
we
have
pursued
for
two
decades
spending
more
money
on
enforcement
and
passing
increasingly
harsh
laws
in
an
attempt
to
drive
unauthorized
immigrants
out
but
despite
the
billions
of
dollars
weve
spent
building
walls
hiring
border
patrol
agents
and
detaining
and
deporting
hundreds
of
thousands
the
unauthorized
population
hasnt
decreased
significantly
instead
of
enforcement
only
we
should
offer
unauthorized
immigrants
a
chance
to
come
forward
register
pay
a
fine
learn
english
pass
background
checks
and
legalize
their
status
legalizing
them
would
inject
a
new
level
of
certainty
into
their
lives
allowing
them
to
invest
more
in
themselves
and
their
communities
legalized
immigrants
will
earn
more
pay
more
taxes
consume
more
buy
houses
start
businesses
and
contribute
more
to
the
economy
americans
want
real
solutions
to
the
problem
of
unauthorized
immigration
that
are
practical
and
fair
enforcement
alone
has
failed
we
need
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
includes
a
legalization
