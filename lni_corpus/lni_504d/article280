what
you

the

the
senate
passed
legislation
last
week
that
sen
edward
kennedy
dmass
hailed
as
the
most
farreaching
immigration
reform
in
our
history
you
might
think
that
the
first
question
anyone
would
ask
is
how
much
it
would
actually
increase
or
decrease
legal
immigration
but
no
after
the
senate
approved
the
bill
by
62
to
36
you
could
not
find
the
answer
in
the
news
columns
of
the
post
the
new
york
times
or
the
wall
street
journal
yet
the
estimates
do
exist
and
are
fairly
startling
by
rough
projections
the
senate
bill
would
double
the
legal
immigration
that
would
occur
during
the
next
two
decades
from
about
20
million
under
present
law
to
about
40
million
one
job
of
journalism
is
to
inform
the
public
about
what
our
political
leaders
are
doing
in
this
case
we
failed
the
senate
bills
sponsors
didnt
publicize
its
full
impact
on
legal
immigration
and
we
didnt
fill
the
void
its
safe
to
say
that
few
americans
know
what
the
bill
would
do
because
no
one
has
told
them
indeed
i
suspect
that
many
senators
who
voted
for
the
legislation
dont
have
a
clue
as
to
the
potential
overall
increase
in
immigration
democracy
doesnt
work
well
without
good
information
here
is
a
classic
case
it
is
interesting
to
contrast
these
immigration
projections
with
a
recent
survey
done
by
the
pew
research
center
the
poll
asked
whether
the
present
level
of
legal
immigration
should
be
changed
the
response
40
percent
favored
a
decrease
37
percent
would
hold
it
steady
and
17
percent
wanted
an
increase
there
seems
to
be
scant
support
for
a
doubling
if
the
large
immigration
projections
had
been
in
the
news
would
the
senate
have
done
what
it
did
possibly
though
i
doubt
it
but
if
it
had
senators
would
have
had
to
defend
what
they
were
doing
as
sound
public
policy
thats
the
real
point
they
would
have
had
to
debate
whether
such
high
levels
of
immigration
are
good
or
bad
for
the
country
rather
than
adopting
a
measure
whose
largest
consequences
are
unintended
or
not
understood
what
arguments
would
they
have
used
no
one
can
contend
that
the
united
states
needs
expanded
immigration
to
prevent
the
population
from
shrinking
our
population
is
aging
but
not
shrinking
with
present
immigration
policies
the
census
bureau
projects
a
us
population
of
420
million
in
2050
up
from
296
million
in
2005
under
the
senate
bill
the
figure
for
2050
would
expand
by
many
millions
another
dubious
argument
is
that
much
higher
immigration
would
dramatically
improve
economic
growth
from
2007
to
2016
the
senate
bill
might
increase
the
economys
growth
rate
by
about
01
percentage
point
annually
the
congressional
budget
office
estimates
thats
tiny
its
a
rounding
error
the
doubling
of
legal
immigration
under
the
senate
bill
that
i
cited
at
the
outset
comes
from
a
previously
unreported
estimate
made
by
white
house
economists
because
the
president
praised
the
senate
bill
the
administration
implicitly
favors
a
big
immigration
expansion
the
white
house
estimate
could
be
low
robert
rector
of
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
has
a
higher
figure
the
cbo
has
a
projection
that
the
white
house
describes
as
close
to
its
own
but
all
the
forecasts
envision
huge
increases
diverging
only
because
they
make
different
assumptions
of
how
the
senate
bill
would
operate
in
practice
our
immigration
laws
involve
a
bewildering
array
of
categories
by
which
people
can
get
a
green
card
the
right
to
stay
permanently
the
senate
bill
dramatically
expands
many
of
these
categories
and
creates
a
large
new
one
guest
workers
the
term
is
really
a
misnomer
because
most
guest
workers
would
receive
an
automatic
right
to
apply
for
a
green
card
and
remain
the
senate
bill
authorizes
200000
guest
workers
annually
plus
their
spouses
and
minor
children
one
obvious
question
is
why
most
of
the
news
media
missed
the
larger
immigration
story
on
may
15
republican
sen
jeff
sessions
of
alabama
held
a
news
conference
with
heritages
rector
to
announce
their
immigration
projections
and
the
estimated
impact
on
the
federal
budget
most
national
media
didnt
report
the
news
conference
the
next
day
the
cbo
released
its
budget
and
immigration
estimates
these
too
were
largely
unreported
though
the
wall
street
journal
later
discussed
the
figures
in
a
story
on
the
bills
possible
budget
costs
rectors
explanation
is
that
the
medias
liberal
bias
creates
a
pro
immigration
slant
i
think
its
more
complicated
stories
generally
mirror
the
prevailing
political
debate
which
has
concentrated
on
amnesty
for
existing
illegal
immigrants
and
the
guestworker
program
increases
in
other
immigration
categories
were
largely
ignored
reporters
also
cover
legislative
stories
as
sports
contests
whos
winning
whos
losing
rather
than
delve
into
dreary
matters
of
substance
weve
had
endless
stories
on
how
immigration
might
affect
congressional
elections
and
whether
there
will
be
a
housesenate
deal
but
note
the
irony
the
white
houses
projected
increases
of
legal
immigration
20
million
are
about
twice
the
level
of
existing
illegal
immigrants
estimated
between
10
million
and
12
million
yet
coverage
overlooks
the
former
here
i
think
rector
has
a
point
whether
or
not
the
bias
is
liberal
groupthink
is
a
powerful
force
in
journalism
immigration
is
considered
noble
people
who
critically
examine
its
value
or
worry
about
its
social
effects
are
subtly
considered
smallminded
stupid
or
bigoted
the
result
is
selective
journalism
that
reflects
poorly
on
our
craft
and
detracts
from
democratic
dialogue
