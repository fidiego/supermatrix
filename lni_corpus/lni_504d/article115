backers
of
arizonastyle
illegal
immigration
laws
for
alabama
received
some
good
news
thursday
when
the
us
supreme
court
upheld
arizonas
law
that
penalizes
employers
who
hire
illegal
immigrants
but
while
the
court
ruled
the
arizona
law
is
constitutional
it
has
yet
to
hear
or
rule
on
other
cases
related
to
other
arizona
laws
that
alabama
lawmakers
are
also
using
as
templates
here
alabama
is
just
one
of
several
states
moving
ahead
with
immigration
legislation
similar
to
arizonas
and
a
housesenate
conference
committee
will
try
to
iron
out
the
differences
between
two
of
those
bills
at
a
meeting
tuesday
if
that
meeting
goes
well
the
sponsor
of
the
house
bill
said
the
legislature
could
take
up
a
final
bill
later
that
day
house
majority
leader
micky
hammon
rdecatur
said
the
conference
committee
version
could
look
like
a
new
bill
and
with
only
four
days
remaining
in
the
legislative
session
the
measure
must
move
rapidly
to
pass
most
north
alabama
lawmakers
said
something
needs
to
be
done
to
curb
illegal
immigration
but
they
arent
united
on
a
solution
one
reason
immigration
bills
are
so
difficult
is
because
the
issues
on
enforcement
are
so
complicated
said
mac
mccutcheon
rcapshaw
who
was
a
police
officer
for
25
years
the
experience
of
other
states
that
passed
their
own
immigration
laws
indicates
he
is
correct
arizona
landed
in
court
soon
after
its
farreaching
immigration
law
took
effect
in
2010
utah
became
embroiled
in
a
lawsuit
14
hours
after
its
antiimmigration
law
went
into
effect
earlier
this
month
in
georgia
where
gov
nathan
deal
signed
that
states
immigration
law
last
week
lawmakers
said
they
are
awaiting
court
challenges
in
alabama
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
southern
poverty
law
center
are
eyeing
sections
of
legislation
they
think
could
overstep
federal
law
but
hammon
and
sen
scott
beason
sponsor
of
the
senates
immigration
bill
believe
alabamas
bills
would
stand
up
in
court
both
hammons
hb56
and
beasons
sb256
would
give
police
the
authority
to
detain
someone
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
is
in
the
country
illegally
a
provision
the
bills
opponents
say
violates
the
us
constitution
i
fully
expect
this
to
be
challenged
in
court
hammon
said
we
believe
ours
will
stand
up
in
court
and
we
expect
that
ultimately
the
supreme
court
will
approve
arizonas
law
beason
rgardendale
said
if
alabama
has
its
own
immigration
law
it
will
be
in
a
position
to
lead
and
put
pressure
on
congress
to
change
federal
law
yet
because
of
the
court
challenges
in
other
states
some
legislators
here
say
alabama
should
wait
until
decisions
come
in
those
cases
here
are
some
of
their
comments
sen
roger
bedford
drussellville
i
believe
we
should
pass
everify
it
puts
responsibility
on
businesses
to
document
their
employees
are
legal
everify
is
the
computerized
federal
database
to
document
a
workers
legal
status
that
the
supreme
court
just
approved
hammons
bill
requires
it
as
for
passing
law
that
has
constitutionality
questions
bedford
said
laws
get
challenged
every
year
in
court
sen
paul
bussman
rcullman
he
would
like
to
see
a
phasein
on
any
law
requiring
employers
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
employees
if
we
cant
find
enough
american
citizens
to
fill
the
jobs
then
we
should
look
at
guestworker
provisions
sen
bill
holtzclaw
rmadison
i
believe
there
is
more
money
leaving
the
state
each
year
through
illegal
immigration
than
the
state
would
spend
on
defending
an
immigration
law
in
court
sen
tammy
irons
dflorence
irons
an
attorney
questions
the
constitutionality
of
provisions
in
alabamas
bills
requiring
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
believe
are
illegals
allowing
reasonable
suspicion
could
lead
to
racial
or
ethnic
profiling
both
of
which
are
unconstitutional
she
said
sen
arthur
orr
rdecatur
states
all
around
us
are
passing
these
laws
he
is
skeptical
of
claims
by
some
employers
that
they
may
be
forced
to
close
if
the
state
forces
them
to
document
employee
immigration
status
rep
mack
mccutcheon
rcapshaw
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
federal
government
needs
to
get
a
grip
on
the
immigration
laws
they
have
all
we
can
do
as
states
is
piecemeal
efforts
until
they
do
he
said
if
alabama
passes
legislation
the
law
needs
to
give
realistic
guidelines
and
flexibility
to
police
who
would
act
as
law
enforcers
one
question
is
who
would
pay
to
house
prisoners
awaiting
deportation
rep
greg
burdine
dflorence
i
support
doing
something
about
illegal
immigration
but
am
hesitant
to
obligate
the
state
to
pay
for
lengthy
expensive
litigation
burdine
an
attorny
wishes
the
state
would
wait
a
year
before
passing
its
own
legislation
he
also
worries
about
provisions
in
state
bills
requiring
local
law
enforcement
to
house
illegal
immigrants
in
county
jails
until
federal
immigration
officials
pick
them
up
alabama
is
already
close
to
a
federal
courtordered
release
of
inmates
in
state
prisons
and
has
a
backlog
of
people
waiting
in
county
jails
due
to
prison
overcrowding
