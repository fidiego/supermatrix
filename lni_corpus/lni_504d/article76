rep
paul
ryan
rwis
is
jockeying
for
position
on
immigration
reform
ryan
the
2012
republican
vice
presidential
nominee
and
budget
guru
of
the
gop
has
kept
a
low
profile
since
the
november
elections
but
ryan
has
quietly
been
discussing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
with
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
one
of
the
most
outspoken
proponents
of
changing
the
nations
immigration
laws
the
wisconsin
republican
has
also
huddled
with
sen
marco
rubio
rfla
a
potential
2016
white
house
rival
who
is
seen
as
the
gops
leading
voice
on
the
issue
ryan
this
week
endorsed
rubios
plan
Â¯
a
clear
sign
that
he
is
not
planning
to
be
on
the
sidelines
during
the
2013
debate
university
of
oregon
political
science
professor
daniel
tichenor
stated
its
a
safe
bet
that
rubio
will
be
at
center
stage
on
immigration
reform
in
coming
months
and
ryan
does
not
want
to
be
outflanked
or
to
surrender
the
spotlight
so
easily
aides
close
to
ryan
and
gutierrez
say
the
budget
committee
chairman
intends
to
continue
to
be
involved
in
immigration
reform
talks
as
congress
moves
closer
to
passing
a
comprehensive
bill
ryans
participation
in
the
early
negotiations
began
in
december
when
while
at
the
gym
he
recommended
to
gutierrez
that
the
illinois
congressman
reach
out
to
rep
raul
labrador
ridaho
according
to
gutierrez
and
congressional
aides
labrador
is
a
tea
party
favorite
who
is
pushing
his
party
to
embrace
immigration
reform
rubio
held
a
wideranging
discussion
with
ryan
last
month
on
the
likely
major
bills
of
the
113th
congress
that
conversation
according
to
a
ryan
aide
included
immigration
they
both
had
a
frank
conversation
as
peers
and
decided
the
time
was
now
to
work
and
move
the
aide
said
there
are
no
plans
for
ryan
to
meet
with
gutierrez
anytime
soon
but
the
two
house
members
plan
to
keep
talking
according
to
staffers
for
the
two
congressmen
the
answer
is
yes
they
plan
to
keep
talking
according
to
one
of
the
aides
gutierrez
recently
left
the
house
financial
services
committee
to
work
on
immigration
reform
as
a
member
of
the
relevant
judiciary
subcommittee
ryan
is
quick
to
cite
his
support
for
a
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill
sponsored
by
gutierrez
and
thenrep
jeff
flake
rariz
in
2005
which
authorizes
nonimmigrant
status
to
undocumented
aliens
in
the
us
if
they
pay
a
fine
and
meet
certain
criteria
it
is
apparent
that
ryan
is
seeking
to
put
some
distance
between
his
position
and
that
of
his
2012
running
mate
mitt
romney
during
the
gop
primary
romney
veered
to
the
right
and
advocated
selfdeportation
of
illegal
immigrants
that
position
was
mocked
by
both
democrats
and
republicans
ive
had
a
pretty
consistent
record
on
the
issue
ryan
said
in
a
brief
interview
on
tuesday
indeed
the
house
budget
committee
chairman
has
been
involved
in
a
number
of
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bills
in
2008
and
2009
but
he
has
also
attracted
criticism
from
immigration
reform
activists
in
2005
he
voted
for
a
bordersecurity
bill
sponsored
by
rep
james
sensenbrenner
jr
rwis
that
advocates
lambasted
ryan
also
voted
against
the
dream
act
which
democratic
leaders
brought
to
the
house
floor
at
the
end
of
2010
regardless
there
is
no
daylight
between
ryan
and
rubio
on
immigration
sen
rubio
is
exactly
right
on
the
need
to
fix
our
broken
immigration
system
ryan
wrote
on
his
facebook
page
on
monday
i
support
the
principles
hes
outlined
modernization
of
our
immigration
laws
stronger
security
to
curb
illegal
immigration
and
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
in
addressing
the
complex
challenge
of
the
undocumented
population
backing
from
ryan
is
a
valuable
asset
for
any
immigration
reform
plan
because
the
eightterm
lawmaker
is
popular
within
the
house
republican
conference
and
with
the
gop
base
gutierrez
said
ryan
is
capable
of
bringing
a
lot
of
republican
votes
hes
going
to
be
critical
and
essential
gutierrez
told
the
hill
on
wednesday
gutierrez
who
has
not
been
shy
in
criticizing
president
obamas
broken
promises
on
immigration
during
his
first
term
stressed
that
ryans
involvement
doesnt
pose
a
threat
to
rubio
university
of
dayton
political
scientist
jamie
longazel
who
specializes
in
immigration
law
and
politics
isnt
shocked
that
ryan
is
weighing
in
i
think
because
hes
in
a
leadership
position
its
not
surprising
to
see
him
taking
the
lead
as
the
republican
party
tries
to
change
his
image
on
immigration
longazel
said
immigration
at
its
core
is
about
money
its
about
economics
ryans
website
says
he
does
not
support
amnesty
for
the
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
already
living
in
the
united
states
but
in
backing
rubios
proposal
ryan
supports
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
albeit
a
more
conservative
one
than
democrats
favor
while
ryan
is
eager
to
make
a
quick
defense
of
his
immigration
record
hes
coy
about
discussing
progress
on
the
latest
negotiations
when
asked
when
his
next
meetings
with
other
legislators
would
happen
ryan
would
only
say
youll
see
immigration
experts
read
ryans
engagement
as
a
sign
that
republicans
are
paying
more
attention
to
latinos
they
finally
appreciate
that
the
gop
cannot
be
a
viable
national
party
with
a
competitive
future
without
changing
how
latino
and
asian
voters
perceive
their
brand
tichenor
said
and
his
potential
involvement
on
immigration
reform
not
only
broadens
his
policy
portfolio
but
also
sets
him
up
as
one
of
the
leaders
who
pushed
the
republican
party
to
broaden
its
