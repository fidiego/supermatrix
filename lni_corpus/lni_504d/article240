immigration
an
american
tradition
byline
robert
rogers
staff
writer
section
news
length
563
words
in
many
ways
the
story
of
immigration
and
assimilation
and
the
upward
mobility
of
subsequent
generations
is
one
of
americas
greatest
cultural
offerings
like
jazz
but
it
hasnt
always
been
a
happy
story
the
history
of
immigration
comes
closer
to
the
fitful
images
in
the
godfather
than
it
does
to
the
romanticized
yarns
spun
by
californias
immigrant
ragstoriches
governor
the
public
perception
of
immigration
has
swung
wildly
over
different
parts
of
american
history
said
cherstin
lyon
a
cal
state
san
bernardino
history
professor
specializing
in
us
citizenship
race
and
ethnicity
different
groups
have
been
targeted
as
hated
immigrant
groups
typically
on
grounds
that
they
brought
down
the
quality
of
life
for
citizens
in
the
1880s
it
was
the
chinese
and
later
the
japanese
and
mexicans
today
lyon
said
immigration
is
under
siege
in
a
highly
politicized
environment
that
routinely
blends
legal
and
illegal
immigration
when
inger
olsen
sought
to
become
an
american
citizen
in
the
mid1950s
the
nation
was
in
the
midst
of
a
prolonged
economic
boom
and
backlash
against
immigration
was
low
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
had
liberalized
criteria
for
admitting
immigrants
particularly
those
from
asia
immigrants
especially
welleducated
ones
from
western
europe
who
fled
the
rebuilding
continent
for
america
were
widely
welcomed
to
immigrate
then
during
the
postwar
decade
was
to
come
during
a
heyday
of
immigration
lyon
said
but
experiences
were
still
very
different
for
people
not
from
western
europe
and
the
smooth
experiences
of
many
of
those
coming
from
those
regions
epitomized
how
preferential
their
status
was
immigration
policy
in
the
united
states
took
its
first
major
turn
with
the
aptly
named
chinese
exclusion
act
of
1882
for
more
than
60
years
the
act
effectively
stopped
chinese
immigration
into
the
country
two
congressional
acts
in
the
early
1920s
extended
de
facto
bans
on
all
asian
immigration
and
severely
limited
admission
of
immigrants
from
southern
and
eastern
europe
the
early
20th
century
was
a
peaking
point
for
institutional
racism
lyon
said
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1965
abolished
ethnic
quotas
in
place
since
1924
paving
the
way
for
a
drastic
diversification
of
the
national
population
including
latinos
replacing
africanamericans
as
the
largest
minority
group
a
notion
almost
unthinkable
just
a
generation
ago
today
public
support
clearly
has
swung
against
immigration
lyon
said
though
business
owners
and
economic
elites
still
favor
liberalized
immigration
just
as
they
did
during
other
eras
of
american
history
us
business
interests
have
never
been
for
restricting
immigration
lyon
said
it
has
always
benefitted
business
to
have
a
larger
force
of
underpaid
and
exploitable
laborers
notions
of
race
culture
and
economics
all
intertwine
to
create
an
atmosphere
either
favorable
or
unwelcoming
to
immigrants
lyon
said
congress
was
unable
to
advance
immigration
reform
earlier
this
year
meanwhile
cities
and
states
are
dealing
with
immigration
related
issues
ranging
from
undocumented
workers
to
english
as
a
national
language
to
whether
undocumented
people
should
be
granted
drivers
licenses
whats
happening
today
isnt
some
new
experience
lyon
said
it
is
an
evolution
of
americas
relationship
with
immigration
