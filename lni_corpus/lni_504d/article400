washington
a
florida
congressman
will
propose
today
that
children
of
illegal
immigrants
 no
longer
be
considered
american
citizens
simply
because
they
are
born
here
but
rep
mark
foleys
constitutional
amendment
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
immigration
showdown
likely
to
take
place
in
congress
this
summer
lawmakers
and
interest
groups
are
divided
into
two
basic
camps
those
who
believe
 illegal
immigration
is
out
of
control
and
those
who
believe
legal
immigration
 is
too
foley
a
west
palm
beach
republican
says
at
least
one
parent
should
be
a
 legal
resident
of
the
united
states
for
the
child
to
be
a
citizen
under
 current
law
any
baby
born
here
is
a
citizen
eligible
for
welfare
and
health
 benefits
and
is
impossible
to
deport
no
matter
what
the
parents status
at
least
50
other
immigration
bills
have
been
introduced
in
congress
some
 to
deny
benefits
or
education
to
illegal
immigrants
and
some
to
stop
all
immigration
at
least
for
a
while
president
clinton
wants
to
beef
up
border
patrols
a
national
identification
system
is
also
being
debated
we
have
got
a
collision
between
compassion
and
reality said
rep
 porter
goss
rsanibel
we
simply
dont
have
the
ability
to
keep
doing
what
 were
doing
no
matter
what
our
hearts
may
say
the
united
states
is
admitting
11million
immigrants
a
year
about
900000
 of
them
legally
the
rest
sneak
across
the
land
borders
or
fly
here
as
 tourists
and
students
then
fail
to
return
home
youre
so
right
about
the
compassion
nobody
wants
to
be
a
bad
guy  rep
sonny
bono
rcalif
told
goss
at
a
subcommittee
hearing
wednesday
bono
supported
proposition
187
in
california
to
deny
welfare
and
education
 to
illegal
immigrants
the
intent
was
never
to
be
a
bad
guy
the
intent
was
 to
say
this
is
out
of
order bono
said
florida
now
has
two
movements
similar
to
proposition
187
and
its
leaders
expect
overwhelming
support
americans
have
been
ambivalent
about
immigration
for
200
years
thats
why
immigrants
have
historically
arrived
in
waves
sometimes
war
or
a
bad
economy
kept
them
from
migrating
but
sometimes
america
slammed
the
door
the
door
was
reopened
most
recently
in
1965
and
immigration
has
increased
steadily
since
poll
after
poll
shows
americans
have
had
enough
and
politicians
last
year
took
notice
california
gov
pete
wilson
revived
his
political
career
with
the
issue
florida
gov
lawton
chiles
used
it
early
and
often
clearly
immigration
has
emerged
as
a
hotbutton
issue
a
potential
wedge
 issue
in
american
politics said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
 national
immigration
forum
which
supports
immigration
its
increasingly
being
used
by
interest
groups
and
politicians
as
an
 easy
explanation
for
a
number
of
problems
that
our
society
faces
so
when
you
 talk
about
high
taxes
you
blame
immigration
you
talk
about
crime
you
blame
immigration
you
talk
about
welfare
you
blame
immigration
many
americans
fail
to
distinguish
between
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
 sharry
said
even
if
they
know
the
difference
most
voters
believe
that
 immigrants
of
any
kind
drain
the
economy
and
rely
heavily
on
welfare
sharry
denies
it
but
both
sides
in
this
debate
have
statistics
to
back
up
their
views
the
house
passed
a
welfare
bill
in
march
that
would
deny
most
benefits
to
 legal
immigrants
they
would
have
to
become
american
citizens
before
they
 would
be
eligible
for
welfare
a
senate
bill
being
debated
in
committee
today
 would
leave
that
decision
up
to
the
states
it
has
been
our
policy
for
100
years
that
newcomers
should
be
selfsupporting said
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
simpson
who
chairs
an
immigration
subcommittee
and
his
counterpart
in
the
house
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
are
among
those
who
believe
legal
 immigration
is
crippling
the
country
they
have
promised
to
introduce
bills
 this
summer
that
would
slash
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
by
hundreds
of
 thousands
per
year
and
revise
the
rules
under
which
immigrants
are
admitted
why
are
we
taking
immigrants
at
all
whats
the
role asks
dan
stein
executive
director
of
fair
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
perhaps
the
leading
antiimmigration
group
in
washington
stein
says
a
moratorium
would
address
every
objection
to
immigration
 whether
the
worries
are
based
on
overpopulation
the
environment
the
costs
of
education
and
health
care
for
immigrants
or
time
for
assimilation
not
everyone
would
be
happy
cuban
exiles
in
florida
for
instance
are
 already
disgruntled
with
clintons
new
policy
to
repatriate
cubans
the
policy
 no
longer
presumes
they
are
all
fleeing
political
persecution
but
stein
said
the
cuban
community
in
miami
simply
cannot
continue
to
 be
unreasonable
they
have
a
private
grievance
with
fidel
castro that
 shouldnt
drive
us
immigration
or
foreign
policy
opposing
immigration
is
a
sure
winner
for
any
presidential
candidate
in
 1996
stein
says
an
issue
strong
enough
to
drive
a
thirdparty
movement
if
 the
democrats
and
republicans
dont
address
it
he
was
delighted
recently
to
 hear
presidential
candidate
patrick
buchanan
call
for
a
moratorium
but
sharry
said
politicians
step
into
treacherous
currents
when
they
take
 the
immigration
issue
beyond
sound
bites
as
the
lights
get
turned
on
in
the
debate
the
policymaking
is
going
to
 get
much
more
complicated he
said
the
magic
bullets
cut
legal
 immigration
the
national
id
card
are
going
to
be
a
lot
more
difficult
to
 enact
both
politically
and
practically
the
debate
is
further
complicated
because
immigration
does
not
stick
to
 party
lines
some
republicans
are
working
hard
to
stop
most
immigration
while
 others
see
open
borders
as
part
of
the
freemarket
system
republican
leaders
including
rep
newt
gingrich
and
sen
bob
dole
extol
 the
contributions
of
immigrants
several
members
of
congress
are
immigrants
 even
floridas
foley
talks
about
his
polish
grandmother
who
cleaned
motel
 toilets
in
her
effort
to
seize
the
american
dream
im
hardpressed
to
think
of
a
single
problem
that
would
be
solved
by
 shutting
off
the
supply
of
willing
and
eager
new
americans house
