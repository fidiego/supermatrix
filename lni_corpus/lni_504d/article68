south
carolina
is
fast
becoming
ground
zero
in
the
fight
over
immigration
reform
a
coalition
of
proreform
groups
on
wednesday
launched
a
major
advertising
and
grassroots
campaign
in
the
state
to
argue
for
immigration
reform
¯
and
to
commend
sen
lindsey
graham
rsc
for
his
efforts
on
its
behalf
the
push
comes
just
weeks
after
numbersusa
a
group
that
vehemently
opposes
the
bipartisan
senate
framework
for
immigration
reform
used
its
first
commercials
of
the
election
cycle
to
attack
graham
the
state
has
taken
on
a
crucial
role
in
the
political
battle
over
reform
¯
and
not
only
because
of
its
senior
senator
rep
trey
gowdy
rsc
is
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committees
immigration
panel
and
will
play
a
central
role
in
shaping
any
immigration
deal
in
congress
the
states
culture
demographics
and
politics
also
make
it
one
to
watch
as
the
issue
plays
out
in
a
republican
senate
primary
south
carolina
is
important
both
because
sen
graham
has
been
part
of
the
group
of
senators
who
have
been
courageously
taking
this
issue
on
and
you
also
have
of
course
trey
gowdy
said
richard
land
president
of
the
ethics
religious
liberty
commission
of
the
southern
baptist
convention
its
up
to
us
to
convince
gowdy
that
the
majority
of
the
members
of
his
district
support
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
we
believe
they
do
land
is
involved
with
the
evangelical
immigration
table
a
group
that
launched
radio
ads
on
christian
radio
stations
across
the
state
on
wednesday
the
group
argues
in
biblical
terms
why
christians
should
support
immigration
reform
other
groups
starting
a
push
in
the
state
include
republicans
for
immigration
reform
a
new
group
formed
by
carlos
gutierrez
former
president
george
w
bushs
commerce
secretary
and
charlie
spies
who
ran
mitt
romneys
superpac
theyre
joining
partnership
for
a
new
american
economy
a
nonpartisan
business
group
that
supports
immigration
reform
to
run
ads
in
the
state
praising
graham
for
his
work
when
you
look
at
south
carolina
it
is
such
a
leader
for
the
rest
of
the
country
on
a
lot
of
these
issues
it
has
agriculture
it
has
business
it
has
faith
it
has
tourism
said
jeremy
robbins
the
director
of
partnership
for
a
new
american
economy
south
carolina
is
a
great
platform
to
start
and
certainly
the
rest
of
the
country
is
looking
to
see
what
lindsey
graham
is
going
to
do
the
deeply
conservative
state
could
serve
as
a
test
case
for
how
far
the
gop
has
moved
on
immigration
south
carolina
passed
a
controversial
immigration
law
similar
to
arizonas
in
2010
and
while
graham
has
long
pushed
for
immigration
reform
other
powerful
politicians
in
the
state
like
former
sen
jim
demint
rsc
have
been
vocal
opponents
south
carolina
has
a
fastgrowing
hispanic
population
¯
and
its
economy
relies
heavily
on
immigrant
labor
for
jobs
ranging
from
tourism
to
agriculture
the
state
is
also
home
to
a
disproportionate
number
of
evangelical
christians
a
group
that
is
being
heavily
targeted
by
proreform
conservatives
if
graham
can
easily
win
his
primary
or
even
avoid
a
serious
challenge
it
will
be
taken
as
a
sign
to
undecided
republicans
in
other
conservative
states
that
they
can
support
reform
without
jeopardizing
their
political
careers
hence
the
contrasting
ads
todays
immigration
laws
are
not
written
for
todays
south
carolina
businesses
charleston
metro
chamber
of
commerce
president
bryan
derreberry
says
in
the
new
ad
calling
for
reform
south
carolina
businesses
will
not
be
able
to
continue
to
grow
without
real
immigration
solutions
sen
graham
is
right
on
target
fighting
for
immigration
reform
today
derreberry
continues
he
knows
how
important
it
is
for
south
carolina
businesses
¯
he
knows
that
for
south
carolina
to
compete
in
the
21st
century
we
have
to
be
able
to
update
our
immigration
laws
a
modern
economy
needs
modern
immigration
laws
and
sen
graham
gets
that
thats
a
decidedly
different
view
from
the
one
numbersusa
took
in
its
sixfigure
ad
buy
who
elected
lindsey
graham
to
demand
millions
more
immigrant
workers
when
so
many
south
carolinians
are
jobless
the
group
asks
in
its
ad
who
elected
sen
graham
to
insist
on
more
green
cards
for
foreign
workers
when
returning
veterans
cant
find
jobs
who
elected
graham
to
demand
amnesty
and
welfare
for
millions
of
illegal
aliens
who
does
lindsey
graham
represent
the
ad
campaign
launched
jointly
by
republicans
for
immigration
reform
and
the
partnership
for
a
new
american
economy
costs
60000
our
focus
isnt
to
have
a
1to1
shouting
match
with
numbersusa
the
focus
is
to
show
deep
and
broad
support
in
the
different
business
sectors
in
sc
and
the
faith
community
