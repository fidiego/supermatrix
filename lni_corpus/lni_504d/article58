jewish
activists
are
worried
that
shock
waves
from
the
boston
marathon
terrorist
attack
could
delay
congressional
action
on
a
longsought
immigration
reform
package
and
endanger
a
provision
on
asylum
the
hebrew
immigrant
aid
society
has
been
urging
lawmakers
to
include
a
provision
in
the
reform
legislation
that
would
extend
filing
deadlines
for
immigrants
seeking
political
asylum
in
the
united
states
but
the
groups
task
may
be
complicated
by
the
emergence
of
two
ethnic
chechen
brothers
as
terrorist
suspects
who
were
first
admitted
into
the
country
as
part
of
a
family
of
political
asylum
seekers
of
course
hias
is
worried
that
immigration
restrictionists
have
already
started
to
exploit
the
boston
tragedy
in
a
manipulative
effort
to
thwart
immigration
as
well
as
asylum
reform
said
mark
hetfield
president
and
ceo
of
hias
the
leading
jewish
advocacy
group
the
boston
terror
attacks
will
have
a
very
substantial
bearing
on
the
issue
for
immigrants
hetfield
countered
that
among
the
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
are
refugees
who
missed
the
asylum
filing
deadline
and
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
would
bring
them
out
of
the
shadows
and
make
america
more
secure
currently
visitors
who
arrive
here
and
decide
to
seek
asylum
as
political
refugees
must
apply
for
this
status
within
12
months
hias
argues
that
individuals
fleeing
persecution
should
be
allowed
a
longer
period
of
time
to
file
for
asylum
before
being
deported
to
the
countries
from
which
they
fled
it
is
a
small
detail
in
a
massive
set
of
rules
and
procedures
offered
in
the
reform
but
dealing
with
any
asylum
issue
in
the
postboston
environment
has
become
somewhat
more
difficult
the
tsarnaev
brothers
suspected
of
carrying
out
the
april
15
attacks
entered
america
on
an
asylum
visa
after
their
parents
convinced
authorities
that
as
muslim
chechens
they
would
face
persecution
from
the
russian
authorities
critics
including
kentucky
republican
senator
rand
paul
have
tied
the
tsarnaevs
entry
into
the
united
states
as
asylum
seekers
to
the
broader
question
of
immigration
reform
why
did
the
current
system
allow
two
individuals
to
immigrate
to
the
united
states
from
the
chechen
republic
in
russia
an
area
known
as
a
hotbed
of
islamic
extremism
who
then
committed
acts
of
terrorism
paul
asked
in
an
april
22
senate
hearing
pauls
question
rests
on
assumptions
that
are
arguably
inaccurate
or
lacking
in
context
tamerlan
and
dzhokhar
tsarnaev
were
granted
asylum
as
young
children
in
2002
based
on
the
governments
approval
of
their
parents
request
there
has
been
no
indication
that
their
parents
the
asylum
applicants
harbored
any
extremist
sympathies
nevertheless
the
discussion
has
raised
questions
about
the
asylum
process
it
might
make
a
difference
politically
because
of
peoples
kneejerk
reaction
said
hetfield
but
he
argued
that
the
boston
attack
could
in
fact
highlight
the
need
for
reform
that
would
close
immigration
loopholes
and
ensure
background
checks
for
all
security
and
immigration
reform
are
not
mutually
exclusive
he
said
in
fact
you
cant
have
security
without
immigration
reform
still
the
effort
by
immigration
reform
opponents
to
shift
attention
to
security
aspects
of
the
issue
could
resonate
with
the
jewish
community
it
is
a
community
known
on
the
one
hand
for
its
strong
support
for
welcoming
immigrants
but
on
the
other
hand
for
its
sensitivity
to
security
concerns
especially
when
related
to
islamic
extremism
im
more
skeptical
of
immigration
reform
now
than
i
was
six
or
seven
months
ago
said
william
kristol
editor
of
the
weekly
standard
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
he
suggested
that
before
we
move
ahead
with
880
pages
of
immigration
reform
a
closer
look
should
be
given
to
security
lapses
such
as
those
revealed
in
dealing
with
the
tsarnaev
brothers
hetfield
making
the
case
for
easing
asylum
procedures
noted
that
the
brothers
did
not
abuse
the
asylum
system
he
stressed
that
asylum
seekers
undergo
strict
background
checks
before
being
allowed
to
stay
in
the
united
states
proimmigration
advocates
in
the
jewish
community
believe
that
these
questions
and
similar
concerns
over
entry
of
extremists
to
the
united
states
will
not
weaken
jewish
determination
to
see
immigration
laws
fixed
were
a
smart
community
and
we
all
understand
it
will
make
everyone
more
secure
said
deborah
lauter
director
of
civil
rights
at
the
antidefamation
league
an
april
22
hearing
at
the
senate
judiciary
committee
over
a
proposed
comprehensive
immigration
bill
made
clear
that
the
boston
attack
and
its
aftermath
now
loom
large
over
the
discussion
a
heated
debate
erupted
as
chuck
schumer
a
jewish
new
york
senator
who
is
among
the
authors
of
the
bill
accused
republicans
of
pointing
to
the
boston
attack
as
an
excuse
for
not
doing
a
bill
or
delaying
it
for
many
months
the
statement
led
to
a
harsh
response
from
iowa
republican
chuck
grassley
who
had
said
earlier
that
immigration
reforms
should
be
carried
out
carefully
in
light
of
the
boston
terror
attack
the
fact
is
that
this
issue
will
now
be
present
in
the
debate
but
it
is
hard
to
say
if
it
will
change
the
structure
of
the
legislation
said
audrey
singer
an
immigration
expert
at
the
brookings
institution
she
noted
that
following
the
november
2012
elections
focus
shifted
away
from
security
aspects
of
immigration
and
toward
the
potential
economic
benefi
ts
of
overhauling
a
system
that
has
failed
to
deal
with
americas
immigration
needs
boston
she
said
shifted
back
the
focus
and
allowed
those
who
have
this
point
of
view
to
be
more
vocal
the
bill
compiled
by
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
known
as
the
gang
of
eight
requires
beefing
up
border
security
to
meet
specific
criteria
of
preventing
illegal
crossing
followed
by
establishing
a
path
to
citizenship
for
an
estimated
12
million
undocumented
workers
currently
living
in
the
united
states
it
also
provides
more
legal
opportunities
for
highskill
and
lowskill
workers
to
come
to
america
following
the
gops
defeat
in
the
2012
elections
which
was
attributed
in
part
to
the
loss
of
the
latino
electorate
republicans
have
moved
towards
support
for
immigration
reform
but
still
not
all
in
the
party
accept
the
notion
of
a
path
to
legalization
for
undocumented
workers
proimmigration
advocates
expressed
optimism
regarding
the
chances
of
reform
legislation
passing
in
the
senate
but
a
house
version
has
yet
to
be
introduced
and
the
battle
there
could
be
tougher
the
white
house
has
indicated
that
it
would
like
to
see
the
reform
approved
this
summer
for
the
jewish
community
immigration
reform
has
always
been
an
easy
sell
driven
by
a
collective
memory
of
earlier
generations
reaching
americas
shores
at
the
turn
of
the
20th
century
the
organized
jewish
community
has
for
years
maintained
a
strong
sentiment
favoring
welcoming
immigration
policy
for
the
current
debate
jewish
groups
formed
the
we
were
strangers
too
coalition
comprising
national
jewish
organizations
as
well
as
local
groups
and
synagogue
denominations
while
all
members
of
the
coalition
support
the
call
for
reform
some
are
pushing
for
specific
amendments
and
provisions
reflecting
their
jewish
interests
and
values
hias
has
asked
lawmakers
to
permanently
designate
iranian
religious
minorities
including
jews
as
eligible
for
refugee
resettlement
in
the
united
states
thus
easing
their
processing
overseas
currently
there
are
an
estimated
700
iranian
jews
waiting
to
immigrate
to
america
the
reform
movement
would
like
to
see
the
bill
improve
family
reunifi
cation
procedures
to
include
siblings
adult
children
and
spouses
of
all
genders
and
bend
the
arc
a
progressive
jewish
organization
is
advocating
equal
rights
for
samesex
couples
undergoing
immigration
procedures
public
opinion
polls
show
strong
support
among
rankandfile
members
of
the
jewish
community
for
a
more
open
immigration
policy
although
this
sentiment
is
not
as
strong
among
older
and
republican
jews
a
2009
poll
however
also
showed
significant
concern
among
american
jews
over
inadequate
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
critics
of
immigration
reform
feel
that
the
boston
events
could
potentially
chip
away
at
jewish
support
for
the
move
by
making
the
connection
between
a
lenient
immigration
policy
and
an
increase
in
the
threat
of
terrorism
the
boston
terror
attacks
will
have
a
very
substantial
bearing
on
the
issue
and
will
increase
public
apprehension
toward
amnesty
said
stephen
steinlight
senior
policy
analyst
at
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
think
tank
opposed
to
immigration
reform
steinlight
who
formerly
served
as
the
american
jewish
committees
director
of
national
affairs
argued
that
the
boston
marathon
attack
made
people
understand
how
inept
the
federal
government
is
at
screening
for
terrorists
this
should
be
a
serious
concern
for
the
jewish
community
he
said
it
is
critical
that
america
remains
a
safe
place
for
jews
hetfield
reached
an
opposite
conclusion
he
believes
that
only
a
process
of
legalization
for
those
already
in
the
country
illegally
will
put
an
end
to
an
existent
underground
made
up
of
millions
of
immigrants
who
fear
any
contact
with
authorities
such
a
process
he
said
would
help
the
government
in
identifying
extreme
elements
who
have
entered
or
might
seek
to
enter
america
