the
purpose
of
hartford
s
recent
illegalimmigration
ordinance
we
are
told
is
to
codify
the
policies
of
the
city
of
hartford
regarding
its
residents
and
usage
of
city
services
as
it
relates
to
their
immigration
status
it
s
always
nice
to
have
everyone
on
the
same
page
the
ordinance
provides
any
service
provided
by
a
city
of
hartford
department
shall
be
made
available
to
residents
regardless
of
immigration
status
unless
such
agency
is
required
by
federal
law
to
deny
eligibility
for
such
service
to
residents
because
of
their
immigration
status
or
to
put
it
in
other
words
the
ordinance
stipulates
that
no
service
currently
provided
by
the
city
to
citizens
naturalborn
citizens
and
legal
immigrants
shall
be
denied
to
illegal
immigrants
the
ordinance
specifies
that
workers
providing
services
to
illegal
immigrants
shall
encourage
residents
regardless
of
immigration
status
to
make
use
of
all
city
services
provided
by
city
departments
for
which
residents
are
not
denied
eligibility
by
federal
law
as
it
relates
to
their
immigration
status
referrals
to
medical
or
social
service
agencies
will
be
made
in
the
same
manner
for
all
residents
without
regard
to
immigration
status
the
exception
should
be
noted
if
federal
law
denies
eligibility
for
hartford
city
services
to
an
illegal
immigrant
not
very
likely
the
ordinance
may
not
trump
the
law
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
specify
those
occasions
in
which
city
services
provided
to
illegal
immigrants
would
violate
federal
law
the
ordinance
also
specifies
that
nothing
in
the
ordinance
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
any
employee
of
the
city
of
hartford
from
cooperating
with
federal
immigration
authorities
as
required
by
law
the
operative
assumption
is
that
federal
law
does
not
require
the
city
service
workers
in
hartford
to
report
illegal
immigrants
to
federal
authorities
because
if
that
were
the
case
the
exception
clause
would
kick
in
illegal
immigration
however
you
turn
the
phrase
on
your
tongue
is
still
illegal
and
the
city
of
hartford
would
be
thwarted
in
its
attempt
to
provide
to
illegal
immigrants
the
same
services
provided
to
citizens
who
have
not
violated
federal
law
by
their
illegal
entree
into
the
country
the
ordinance
blurs
what
had
previously
been
a
sharp
line
between
illegal
and
legal
residency
on
police
matters
the
ordinance
is
very
specific
it
requires
hartford
police
officers
not
to
make
inquiries
concerning
a
person
s
immigration
status
unless
such
an
act
is
relevant
to
an
investigation
involving
criminal
activity
hartford
police
shall
not
inquire
about
the
immigration
status
of
crime
victims
witnesses
or
others
who
call
or
approach
the
hartford
police
department
no
person
shall
be
detained
solely
on
the
belief
that
he
or
she
is
not
present
legally
in
the
united
states
or
that
he
or
she
has
committed
a
civil
immigration
violation
there
is
no
general
obligation
for
a
police
officer
to
contact
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
regarding
any
person
unless
that
person
is
arrested
on
a
criminal
charge
hartford
police
officers
shall
not
make
arrests
based
on
administrative
warrants
for
removal
entered
by
ice
into
the
national
crime
information
center
database
including
administrative
immigration
warrants
for
persons
with
outstanding
removal
deportation
or
exclusion
orders
enforcement
of
the
civil
provisions
of
united
states
immigration
law
is
the
responsibility
of
federal
immigration
officials
the
last
paragraph
quoted
above
is
particularly
jarring
because
it
calls
upon
hartford
police
not
to
cooperate
with
federal
officials
who
previously
had
depended
upon
city
police
to
detain
and
arrest
illegal
immigrants
for
whom
the
federal
government
has
outstanding
warrants
the
city
of
hartford
in
its
ordinance
airily
dismisses
any
obligation
that
police
officers
may
have
to
cooperate
with
federal
authorities
in
apprehending
those
who
have
violated
federal
law
because
enforcement
of
the
civil
provisions
of
united
states
immigration
law
is
the
responsibility
of
federal
immigration
officials
one
should
view
the
ordinance
as
a
beginning
in
the
struggle
of
states
to
detach
themselves
from
federal
obligations
to
satisfy
local
political
constituencies
the
state
through
this
ordinance
is
in
effect
taunting
the
federal
government
and
saying
to
it
we
know
that
we
are
servicing
illegal
immigrants
and
refusing
to
cooperate
with
federal
authorities
in
their
apprehension
and
expulsion
just
try
to
stop
us
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
kingdom
strikes
back
