words
as
congress
weighs
immigration
reform
public
attention
has
been
fixed
on
whether
to
erect
a
fence
along
the
usmexico
border
and
what
to
do
about
a
guestworker
program
but
a
littlenoticed
provision
in
the
senates
wideranging
immigration
bill
would
erase
a
controversial
bush
administration
directive
that
four
years
ago
dramatically
changed
the
way
the
immigration
system
deals
with
deportation
and
asylum
cases
the
proposed
reforms
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
often
the
last
hope
for
noncitizens
fighting
deportation
have
slid
through
thus
far
with
little
debate
yet
if
approved
the
changes
would
be
profound
and
may
address
what
many
critics
including
an
increasing
number
of
federal
appellate
judges
have
labeled
rubber
stamp
justice
in
the
immigration
system
the
chief
reforms
would
for
the
most
part
wipe
out
former
attorney
general
john
ashcrofts
2002
decision
to
downsize
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
order
a
majority
of
deportation
and
asylum
cases
resolved
without
explanation
by
one
board
member
ashcroft
who
sought
to
tighten
immigration
in
the
aftermath
of
the
sept
11
attacks
reduced
the
board
from
23
members
to
11
as
part
of
the
streamlining
regulations
to
reduce
a
huge
backlog
of
cases
the
result
has
been
an
explosion
of
appeals
in
the
federal
courts
particularly
in
the
san
franciscobased
9th
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
covers
california
and
eight
other
western
states
the
9th
circuits
immigration
appeals
have
jumped
from
900
to
about
6000
in
the
past
five
years
as
large
numbers
of
immigrants
fighting
deportation
argue
theyve
received
short
shrift
in
the
system
a
mercury
news
series
last
year
found
the
9th
circuit
has
been
overturning
a
majority
of
the
most
important
deportation
and
asylum
cases
coming
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
other
federal
courts
have
also
blasted
the
board
for
shoddy
decision
making
particularly
in
streamlined
cases
some
judges
and
lawyers
familiar
with
the
issue
are
hoping
congress
approves
many
of
the
reforms
which
would
restore
the
board
to
23
members
and
call
for
the
vast
majority
of
immigration
appeals
to
be
decided
by
three
board
members
effectively
scrapping
streamlining
its
a
positive
move
said
lory
rosenberg
a
former
appeals
board
member
who
resigned
when
ashcroft
downsized
the
agency
you
could
say
congress
is
making
an
effort
to
take
the
matter
in
hand
and
exercise
some
control
and
responsibility
over
the
process
it
is
unclear
whether
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
who
recently
launched
a
review
of
the
immigration
courts
will
take
a
formal
position
on
the
legislation
but
the
appeals
board
which
is
under
the
justice
department
has
defended
streamlining
arguing
that
it
has
eliminated
a
massive
backlog
of
tens
of
thousands
of
immigration
cases
the
latest
reforms
to
immigration
appeals
have
evolved
in
recent
months
spurred
by
sen
arlen
specter
rpa
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
specter
previously
pushed
a
plan
to
shift
thousands
of
immigration
appeals
in
courts
around
the
country
to
a
washington
dcbased
appeals
court
that
now
specializes
in
patent
cases
specter
said
he
wanted
one
federal
court
specializing
in
immigration
cases
but
critics
particularly
federal
judges
opposed
the
move
saying
it
didnt
address
the
problem
of
subpar
decisions
from
the
immigration
courts
as
a
result
specter
backed
off
and
has
now
included
a
provision
in
the
bill
that
calls
for
a
study
of
how
the
federal
appellate
courts
handle
immigration
cases
the
rest
of
the
provisions
are
aimed
at
improving
the
immigration
courts
including
adding
immigration
judges
and
justice
department
lawyers
to
handle
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigration
matters
heard
each
year
mary
schroeder
the
9th
circuits
chief
judge
said
that
reversing
the
streamlining
policy
and
getting
better
decisions
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
will
ease
the
pressure
on
the
federal
courts
to
the
extent
our
problems
have
been
created
by
the
elimination
of
administrative
review
in
that
agency
this
will
go
toward
improving
the
situation
schroeder
said
washington
insiders
following
the
legislation
say
the
fate
of
the
immigration
court
provisions
are
uncertain
as
congress
spars
over
the
entire
package
but
they
are
expected
to
get
through
the
senate
if
the
overall
immigration
legislation
gets
resolved
tim
sparapani
legislative
counsel
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
there
is
no
doubt
the
reforms
will
make
it
out
of
the
senate
but
others
worry
that
the
reforms
may
go
too
far
some
immigration
experts
say
the
appeals
board
should
return
to
a
1999
policy
