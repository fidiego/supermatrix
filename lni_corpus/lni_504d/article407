already
locked
in
fierce
debate
over
illegal
immigration
congress
and
reform
advocates
are
turning
their
attention
to
legal
immigration
at
issue
how
many
and
what
kinds
of
immigrants
does
america
need
the
national
commission
on
immigration
reform
which
last
year
delivered
recommendations
to
congress
for
dealing
with
illegal
immigration
wednesday
held
the
first
of
nine
public
meetings
to
gather
data
on
legal
immigration
and
the
national
interest
at
the
same
time
republicans
in
congress
promise
a
push
to
cut
the
numbers
now
about
900000
people
a
year
bills
will
call
for
a
temporary
moratorium
on
immigration
sharp
reductions
in
the
number
admitted
every
year
and
restriction
of
family
preference
to
spouses
and
minor
children
only
the
debate
could
produce
one
of
the
most
sweeping
reviews
of
immigration
policy
in
decades
the
starting
point
ought
to
be
not
whats
fair
to
every
single
person
in
the
world
but
whats
in
the
best
interest
of
america
and
americans
says
warren
leiden
commission
member
and
head
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
the
proimmigrant
lobby
under
siege
from
rising
public
antipathy
to
immigrants
fears
an
attack
on
policies
that
allow
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigrants
to
reunite
with
relatives
in
the
us
this
is
not
about
cold
numbers
its
about
family
values
says
cecilia
munoz
of
the
hispanic
group
national
council
of
la
raza
the
restrictionist
view
of
immigration
is
more
skeptical
im
not
sure
there
is
a
national
need
for
immigration
anymore
maybe
an
albert
einstein
or
a
ballerina
but
the
need
for
largescale
unskilled
immigration
ended
100
years
ago
says
dan
stein
of
the
federation
of
american
immigration
reform
whose
influence
has
grown
dramatically
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
chairman
of
the
senates
immigration
subcommittee
will
push
for
a
fiveyear
breathing
space
cutting
legal
immigration
by
25
per
year
sen
richard
shelby
rala
introduced
a
bill
last
week
to
cut
immigration
by
twothirds
to
about
325000
per
year
the
country
has
had
similar
debates
over
immigration
before
the
last
time
in
1990
when
congress
increased
the
overall
numbers
of
immigrants
and
allowed
for
more
immigrants
from
certain
countries
the
commissioners
led
by
exrepresentative
barbara
jordan
dtexas
are
aware
of
how
touchy
the
issue
can
be
but
we
are
really
nudging
the
administration
and
we
have
the
ear
of
congress
at
this
time
jordan
said
wednesday
the
vast
majority
of
immigrants
are
admitted
because
theyre
related
to
citizens
or
legal
residents
the
wait
for
a
visa
is
long
up
to
30
years
according
to
immigration
lawyers
current
policy
also
grants
preference
for
parents
siblings
and
married
older
children
who
in
turn
can
petition
to
bring
in
more
relatives
were
on
autopilot
now
says
stein
the
system
has
to
be
deconstructed
and
rebuilt
in
a
way
that
takes
the
pressure
off
for
growth
others
argue
that
family
preference
unfairly
favors
certain
countries
mexico
chiefly
and
unintentionally
imitates
the
old
national
origins
quota
system
that
favored
immigration
by
white
europeans

system
with

we
want

to

and

diverse
as
possible
