in

an
annual
report
scheduled
for
release
today
will
provide
these
details
on
the
local
work
accomplishments
during
fiscal
2007
by
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
action
on
919966
applications
for
immigration
benefits
42785
approvals
of
employmentbased
visas
sought
by
people
seeking
permanent
status
in
the
united
states
thats
more
than
triple
the
total
for
the
previous
fiscal
year
7800
reviews
of
applications
for
citizenship
from
military
personnel
serving
overseas
that
brings
the
total
in
that
category
which
lincoln
handles
for
the
entire
united
states
to
more
than
50000
since
the
program
began
in
2001
in
highlighting
the
numbers
jerry
heinauer
director
of
the
nebraska
service
center
offered
more
testimony
to
the
impact
on
the
lincoln
economy
he
said
he
had
the
green
light
as
of
wednesday
to
hire
94
more
people
for
permanent
staff
in
2008
and
perhaps
another
103
beyond
that
his
present
staff
totals
about
1000
as
government
employees
or
under
contract
at
the
service
center
near
lincoln
municipal
airport
or
downtown
at
the
star
building
seen
from
heinauers
vantage
point
the
cause
of
validating
legal
immigration
employs
a
lot
of
people
and
finishing
a
years
work
on
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigration
cases
is
a
little
bit
telling
but
heinauer
and
his
staff
might
be
waiting
a
long
time
for
a
pat
on
the
back
thats
because
the
service
center
results
emerge
at
a
time
when
illegal
immigration
is
a
hugely
divisive
issue
in
nebraska
and
elsewhere
and
when
congress
has
a
long
record
of
failure
on
immigration
reform
a
year
ago
wednesday
those
differences
of
opinion
were
readily
apparent
as
the
enforcement
arm
of
the
federal
governments
vast
immigration
bureaucracy
descended
on
six
swift
meatpacking
plants
including
grand
island
and
made
almost
1300
arrests
lourdes
gouveia
director
of
latinolatin
american
studies
at
the
university
of
nebraska
at
omaha
isnt
very
happy
with
the
immigration
picture
in
december
2007
and
apart
from
all
the
accomplishments
in
lincoln
on
what
she
regards
as
the
good
side
of
federal
immigration
regulation
gouveia
also
a
uno
sociologist
is
especially
unhappy
with
the
performance
of
presidential
candidates
her
criticism
is
aimed
at
both
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
as
they
try
to
satisfy
voter
concerns
about
people
sneaking
across
the
mexico
border
obviously
any
academic
or
any
individual
involved
seriously
in
analysis
and
understanding
of
the
immigration
issue
has
to
be
terribly
disappointed
with
whats
going
on
she
said
in
the
presidential
realm
its
really
embarrassing
to
see
how
all
of
them
democrats
and
republicans
for
whom
were
all
supposed
to
be
enthused
about
voting
in
the
next
election
are
totally
pandering
to
a
shrill
minority
national
news
stories
suggest
immigration
advocates
might
actually
be
in
the
minority
on
such
subjects
as
issuing
drivers
licenses
to
people
who
cant
prove
legal
status
heinauer
isnt
going
to
get
caught
up
in
that
debate
nor
does
he
see
a
paradox
in
circumstances
in
which
hes
reporting
on
success
in
furthering
the
cause
of
legal
immigration
in
lincoln
even
as
the
country
loudly
disagrees
on
how
to
adjust
the
immigration
rules
to
let
more
people
in
or
keep
more
people
out
i
dont
think
so
he
said
our
responsibility
is
pretty
clear
our
goals
and
expectations
are
pretty
clear
as
a
center
in
terms
of
processing
times
in
terms
of
identifying
cases
where
an
applicant
is
not
eligible
for
a
benefit
sought
out
later
wednesday
in
minneapolis
spokesman
tim
counts
said
the
federal
governments
immigration
enforcement
officials
arent
ready
to
release
their
report
on
fiscal

2007
yet
but
