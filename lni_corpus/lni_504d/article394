david
ramgobin
was
only
10
when
he
and
his
family
came
to
this
country
from
trinidad
he
says
he
grew
up
thinking
he
was
as
american
as
the
next
guy
he
pledged
allegiance
to
the
flag
at
public
school
served
in
the
us
army
and
later
in
life
paid
taxes
except
for
not
being
able
to
vote
it
never
bothered
him
that
he
was
a
legal
immigrant
with
a
green
card
instead
of
a
citizen
with
a
us
passport
but
resentment
toward
immigrants
even
legal
residents
is
building
in
america
like
thunder
clouds
on
a
summer
night
ramgobin
who
is
now
32
felt
compelled
to
make
a
change
on
monday
he
stood
in
a
woodpaneled
maryland
courtroom
raised
his
right
hand
and
took
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
united
states
of
america
becoming
a
citizen
with
50
other
immigrants
its
a
stigma
today
being
an
immigrant
he
said
a
debate
over
what
to
do
about
the
more
than
a
million
foreigners
who
move
to
this
country
every
year
is
spreading
and
is
challenging
cherished
notions
about
what
america
is
all
about
the
nations
generous
tradition
of
accepting
the
worlds
tired
hungry
and
poor
has
always
been
a
proud
symbol
of
the
country
but
today
from
the
town
halls
of
california
to
the
marble
corridors
of
congress
lawmakers
and
citizens
are
questioning
just
what
this
countrys
commitments
to
immigrants
should
be
how
many
immigrants
and
refugees
do
we
need
what
are
they
owed
what
can
they
be
denied
the
country
sees
itself
in
a
situation
where
its
not
sure
it
can
invite
all
these
people
in
said
rodolfo
o
de
la
garza
an
immigration
specialist
at
the
university
of
texas
in
austin
most
immigrants
are
selfsupporting
and
contribute
to
the
wellbeing
of
their
communities
in
many
inner
cities
they
have
revitalized
entire
neighborhoods
opening
stores
and
providing
longlost
services
to
communities
many
industries
too
rely
on
foreignborn
workers
to
fill
skilled
technical
jobs
like
engineering
nevertheless
growing
numbers
of
americans
fear
that
immigrants
are
threatening
the
national
culture
and
their
personal
economic
wellbeing
those
fears
are
being
transferred
into
political
action
and
a
change
this
year
in
immigration
policy
is
almost
inevitable
according
to
many
immigration
experts
and
politicians
the
political
will
in
the
republicancontrolled
congress
is
so
set
and
the
public
mood
on
immigration
so
sour
that
those
hoping
to
maintain
relatively
liberal
immigration
policies
will
be
facing
a
tough
struggle
we
dont
have
a
problem
anymore
we
have
a
crisis
and
thats
why
we
have
to
do
something
right
now
said
rep
lamar
smith
r
texas
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
international
law
immigration
and
refugees
for
the
house
judiciary
committee
already
president
clinton
has
shown
a
willingness
to
respond
to
such
concerns
making
it
clear
through
his
actions
that
he
believes
there
are
limits
to
the
countrys
openness
he
has
bolstered
efforts
to
catch
illegal
immigrants
increasing
the
money
and
personnel
for
border
patrols
he
has
adopted
a
tougher
stand
than
his
republican
predecessors
on
limiting
the
entry
of
refugees
and
asylumseekers
last
summer
he
detained
tens
of
thousands
of
haitians
and
cubans
at
the
us
naval
base
in
guantanamo
cuba
instead
of
allowing
them
onto
us
soil
to
await
decisions
on
whether
they
could
stay
he
changed
the
policy
under
which
cubans
automatically
received
asylum
here
critics
say
that
clinton
mindful
that
immigration
is
a
likely
1996
presidential
campaign
issue
is
playing
politics
the
clinton
administration
has
taken
an
unduly
restrictive
approach
said
arthur
helton
a
refugee
advocate
for
the
open
society
institute
its
too
closely
attuned
to
the
meanspirited
immigration
debate
in
this
country
that
debate
is
likely
to
turn
1995
into
a
year
of
decisions
and
choices
on
immigration
comprehensive
bills
to
change
immigration
policy
are
being
assembled
in
the
house
and
senate
the
focus
of
policy
change
is
expanding
while
illegal
immigrants
have
long
been
the
subject
of
public
ire
legal
immigrants
now
are
being
cast
as
part
of
the
problem
already
the
house
as
part
of
the
republican
contract
with
america
has
adopted
a
welfare
bill
that
would
deny
benefits
to
legal
immigrants
immigration
advocates
fear
that
things
will
only
get
worse
early
this
month
a
bipartisan
commission
handed
clinton
a
recommendation
that
the
numbers
of
legal
immigrants
and
refugees
that
the
country
accepts
be
trimmed
sharply
a
key
provision
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
extended
families
to
be
reunited
in
this
country
the
allotment
of
visas
for
reuniting
the
families
of
citizens
and
legal
residents
would
be
cut
by
onefifth
the
openings
for
refugees
would
be
halved
and
the
10000
special
slots
for
unskilled
workers
would
be
eliminated
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
said
he
was
stunned
by
the
commissions
report
thats
an
unfair
backlash
against
legal
immigration
stemming
from
a
frustration
over
illegal
immigration
sharry
said
but
the
us
commission
on
immigration
reform
appointed
by
congress
in
1990
and
headed
by
former
democratic
rep
barbara
jordan
of
texas
was
hardly
out
on
a
limb
with
its
recommendations
these
bills
are
pending
or
will
soon
be
introduced
in
congress
borders
and
benefits
sen
alan
k
simpson
r
wyo
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
immigration
and
refugee
affairs
for
the
judiciary
committee
has
introduced
legislation
that
would
strengthen
the
us
border
patrol
deny
public
benefits
to
illegal
residents
and
repeal
a
1960
law
that
grants
automatic
asylum
to
cubans
it
also
would
test
a
national
identification
system
that
would
make
it
harder
for
illegal
residents
to
find
work
or
receive
public
services
simpson
also
plans
to
sponsor
another
bill
to
reduce
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
families
rep
smith
of
texas
is
at
work
on
a
comprehensive
bill
on
legal
and
illegal
immigration
that
will
be
introduced
wednesday
the
bill
is
expected
to
endorse
the
commissions
recommendation
to
end
chain
migration
or
the
movement
of
extended
families
into
this
country
specifically
it
would
end
the
special
preference
given
to
reuniting
the
sisters
brothers
and
adult
children
of
legal
immigrants
instead
that
priority
would
be
reserved
for
the
parents
or
minor
children
of
legal
immigrants
children
rep
brian
bilbray
r
calif
has
sponsored
a
bill
to
end
automatic
citizenship
to
the
children
born
on
us
soil
to
illegal
immigrants
bilbray
a
freshman
from
san
diego
said
that
in
1992
in
california
alone
96000
children
were
born
to
illegal
residents
the
word
is
out
all
over
the
world
that
you
can
just
come
here
illegally
and
you
dont
have
to
worry
bilbray
said
thats
the
kind
of
message
weve
got
to
stop
we
need
to
bring
credibility
back
to
immigration
law
the
political
mood
in
congress
today
is
a
far
cry
from
what
it
was
in
1990
when
the
legislature
passed
one
of
the
most
expansive
immigrations
laws
in
recent
times
the
immigration
act
of
1990
allowed
for
more
visas
for
skilled
and
unskilled
workers
as
well
as
for
family
members
of
legal
immigrants
it
also
created
a
special
pool
of
visas
to
be
handed
out
by
lottery
but
that
was
then
and
this
is
now
americans
have
become
increasingly
anxious
about
their
jobs
and
futures
american
people
going
into
the
1990s
are
feeling
pinched
in
a
lot
of
ways
said
lawrence
h
fuchs
an
immigration
historian
at
brandeis
university
you
have
this
growing
sense
of
unease
and
a
certain
amount
of
scapegoating
takes
place
fuchs
who
was
vice
chairman
of
the
immigration
commission
said
the
government
needed
to
revise
the
way
it
selected
permanent
residents
immigration
is
not
a
free
good
fuchs
said
there
are
costs
as
well
as
benefits
and
thats
why
the
immigration
admission
system
has
to
be
regulated
with
very
clear
goals
and
priorities
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
the
public
mood
toward
immigration
consider
the
strong
show
of
support
in
november
for
californias
proposition
187
the
measure
would
deny
educational
medical
and
welfare
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
for
the
last
40
years
illegal
and
legal
immigration
has
been
running
wild
and
has
produced
concerns
among
average
american
citizens
about
education
the
infrastructure
of
our
medical
system
and
our
social
service
system
said
harold
ezell
a
former
immigration
official
and
coauthor
of
proposition
187
we
need
a
good
immigration
policy
but
more
is
not
necessarily
better
