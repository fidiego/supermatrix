washington
in
early
september
tom
tancredo
was
standing
in  front
of
a
steamroller
the
republican
congressman
from
littleton
was
a
lone
voice
of  protest
as
president
bush
had
mexican
president
vicente
fox
to
a  state
dinner
the
political
question
of
amnesty
for
illegal  immigrants
seemed
not
so
much
if
but
when
but
on
a
recent
day
in
the
emerald
confines
of
his
office  its
clear
the
steamroller
is
now
going
in
the
other
direction  during
a
meeting
tancredos
chief
of
staff
jaqueline
ponder  tells
him
immigration
is
a
huge
issue
right
now
to
underscore  the
point
another
staffer
tells
him
that
after
four
months
the  white
house
has
returned
his
call
top
presidential
adviser
karl
rove
wants
a
meeting
on
immigration
tancredo
leans
back
in
his
leather
chair
and
savors
a
short  laugh
i
draw
a
conclusion
that
weve
been
loud
enough
that
someone  finally
heard
tancredo
says
i
think
its
a
positive
tancredo
is
on
a
roll
hes
a
thirdyear
congressman
with  little
formal
power
but
since
hijacked
planes
crashed
into
the  world
trade
center
the
pentagon
and
pennsylvania
the
immigration  issues
hes
pushed
for
years
from
the
sidelines
are
suddenly
on  the
lips
of
official
washington
amnesty
has
been
shelved
the
immigration
and
naturalization  service
which
hes
bashed
repeatedly
is
up
for
a
thorough  overhaul
the
idea
of
putting
troops
on
the
border
no
longer
seems  strange
to
many
and
tancredo
is
in
demand
as
the
spokesman
in
congress
for  those
who
think
too
many
people
are
crossing
the
border
hes
been  sucked
into
the
vortex
of
the
24hour
news
channels
looking
for  someone
to
give
voice
to
those
sentiments
and
his
congressional  immigration
reform
caucus
has
swelled
from
15
conservative  republicans
to
more
than
50
lawmakers
including
some
democrats
tancredos
been
out
in
the
wilderness
hes
been
saying
the  right
things
for
the
right
reasons
and
hes
been
vindicated  said
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
antiimmigration  federation
for
american
immigration
reform
theres
so
many  positive
things
that
could
happen
by
reducing
immigration
and
  enhancing
enforcement
stopping
terrorism
is
only
one
of
them
tancredos
role
has
not
been
to
pass
legislation
but
to  create
pressure
that
pushes
the
debate
his
way
we
raise
issues
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
end
up
in
someone  elses
proposal
tancredo
said
that
makes
it
hard
to
say
what
role
hes
played
in
the  immigration
changes
that
have
taken
place
but
its
even
less  clear
how
effective
tancredo
can
be
in
shifting
the
debate
from  screening
out
terrorists
to
actually
cutting
down
the
flow
of  immigrants
across
the
borders
tancredo
is
pushing
a
moratorium
on
all
immigration
his  caucus
agenda
includes
a
sixmonth
suspension
on
visas
into
the  country
eliminating
a
program
that
allows
50000
people
into
the  country
from
around
the
world
and
repealing
a
provision
that  allows
people
to
change
their
immigration
status
without
returning  to
their
home
country
for
many
that
departs
from
the
flaws
in
the
system
that  allowed
terrorists
to
slip
into
the
country
and
returns
to
the  social
and
economic
debate
about
immigration
that
existed
before  the
sept
11
attacks
and
on
that
he
will
find
himself
again
fighting
his
own  president
and
fellow
republicans
even
as
he
moved
to
tighten
visa
requirements
bush
said  thats
not
to
say
were
not
going
to
let
people
come
into
our  country
of
course
we
are
rep
george
gekas
rpa
the
gatekeeper
in
the
house
on  immigration
as
chairman
of
the
immigration
subcommittee
gives  little
encouragement
to
tancredo
and
his
caucus
saying
curtly  theyll
have
their
day
in
court
immigration
supporters
even
though
theyve
been
put
on
the  defensive
since
the
sept
11
attacks
say
they
feel
little
threat  from
tancredo
and
his
caucus
they
say
his
ideas
are
too
extreme  too
antiimmigrant
and
just
not
likely
to
pass
he
is
the
loudest
restrictionist
voice
in
the
house
of  representatives
said
angela
kelley
policy
director
at
the  national
immigration
forum
but
i
hear
everyone
talking
about
the  need
to
isolate
terrorists
not
to
shut
out
hardworking
people
who  come
here
to
join
family
members
i
dont
think
extreme
measures  are
likely
to
pass
and
there
are
signs
that
his
caucus
is
starting
to
fray
one  of
the
democrats
he
recruited
to
give
the
caucus
bipartisan  credibility
rep
william
pascrell
dnj
abruptly
withdrew  recently
he
wont
be
any
part
of
a
caucus
thats
antilegal  immigration
pascrell
spokesman
david
filipelli
said
even
tancredo
himself
sounds
a
little
unsure
about
what
he  can
accomplish
but
he
says
he
has
a
strategy
when
i
got
here
somebody
told
me
theres
only
one
way
to  get
something
done
talk
about
it
constantly
tancredo
said
i  remember
saying
i
can
do
