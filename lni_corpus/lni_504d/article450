expected
to
be
a
major
player
in
the
presidential
race
come
nov
4
like
with
the
democratic
primary
back
in
may
it
should
make
for
great
voter
turnout
and
a
very
interesting
october
the
issues
facing
all
of
americans
are
the
same
issues
that
face
north
carolinians
but
we
feel
the
order
of
those
issues
differs
in
our
state
we
also
feel
its
important
to
know
where
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
stand
on
those
issues
so
today
were
listing
the
top
3
issues
in
our
state
for
this
presidential
election
and
the
stances
these
two
men
have
made
in
the
past
and
during
their
campaigns
on
these
issues
the
top
3
issues
in
no
particular
order
illegal
immigration
perhaps
more
than
in
most
states
illegal
immigration
is
a
hot
button
a
recent
elon
university
poll
states
that
58
percent
of
north
carolinians
who
responded
think
immigration
legal
or
illegal
of
latinos
and
hispanics
has
been
bad

the
us
heres
where
the

stand
on
immigration
obama
according
to
obamas
official
web
site
obama
believes
the
immigration
issue
has
been
exploited
by
politicians
to
divide
the
nation
rather
than
find
real
solutions
obamas
immigration
plan
according
to
the
site
would
create
secure
borders
improve
the
immigration
system
remove
incentives
to
those
who
enter
illegally
bring
people
out
of
the
shadows
and
work
to
promote
economic
development

mexico
mccain
accused
by
some
for
being
soft
on
immigration
mccain
told
a
crowd
in
pennsylvania
this
week
that
he
will
enact
comprehensive
immigration
reform
so
we
can
put
people
after
they
have
to
do
certain
things
obviously
on
a
path
to
citizenship
in
this
country
as
part
of
an
overall
immigration
reform
policy
the
war
in
iraq
with
large
military
bases
in
our
state
its
clear
why
the
war
is
on
our
minds
the
two
candidates
talked
in
detail
about
iraq
in
friday
nights
debate
obama
obama
has
stressed
his
opposition
to
the
handling
of
iraq
during
his
campaign
and
friday
he
reiterated
his
stance
while
trying
to
avoid
seeming
soft
on
using
force
when
necessary
he
said
friday
his
position
on
iraq
was
prompted
partly
by
worries
that
it
would
distract
from
hunting
down
osama
bin
laden
in
afghanistan
and
he
said
withdrawing
from
iraq
now
would
free
up
resources
mccain
mccain
a
highly
decorated
vietnam
war
veteran
and
former
pow
has
backed
the
surge
of
us
troops
in
baghdad
saying
its
reduced
violence
he
says
withdrawing
troops
now
would
destabilize
not
only
iraq
but
the
entire
middle
east
offshore
drilling
north

is
experiencing
a
gasoline
shortage
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
and
to
the
east
its
primed
for
drilling
if
congress
lets
the
offshore
ban
expire
obama
some
have
accused
obama
of
flipflopping
on
his
stance
on
offshore
drilling
hes
been
quoted
recently
as
saying
he
would
consider
a
compromise
to
lift
the
ban
obama
has
answered
those
critics
by
saying
what
i
will
not
do
and
this
has
always
been
my
position
is
support
a
plan
that
suggests
this
drilling
is
the
answer
to
our
energy
problems
mccain
the
republican
candidate
supports
ending
the
ban
on
offshore
drilling
he
recently
told
reporters
we
have
untapped
oil
reserves
of
at
least
21
billion
barrels

in
the
way
