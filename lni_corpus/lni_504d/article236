words
lets
debunk
the
biggest
myths
of
the
antiimmigration
movement
that
has
swept
this
country
and
may
still
have
an
impact
on
the
2008
presidential
race
that
it
is
not
antihispanic
that
it
doesnt
oppose
legal
immigration
and
that
its
against
only
illegal
immigration
most
us
republican
presidential
hopefuls
with
the
exception
of
sen
john
mccain
and
cable
television
antiimmigration
crusaders
on
cnn
and
fox
news
are
deceiving
the
public
with
their
claim
that
they
are
only
against
illegal
immigration
149
myth
no
1
we
are
only
against
illegal
immigration
undocumented
immigrants
should
get
in
line
for
visas
thats
deceptive
because
you
cant
demand
that
people
get
into
line
when
for
the
most
part
there
is
no
line
to
get
into
while
the
us
labor
market
is
demanding
15
million
mostly
lowskilled
immigrants
a
year
and
will
demand
many
more
in
coming
years
as
the
us
population
becomes
increasingly
educated
the
current
immigration
system
allows
into
the
us
an
average
of
1
million
legal
immigrants
a
year
and
most
of
them
are
already
here
there
is
a
huge
mismatch
between
what
the
us
labor
market
needs
and
the
supply
of
immigration
visas
says
frank
sharry
head
of
the
national
immigration
forum
which
advocates
both
secure
borders
and
a
path
to
legal
residence
for
many
of
the
12
millionplus
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
united
states
on
top
of
that
most
antiimmigration
groups
want
to
reduce
legal
immigration
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
fair
a
favorite
of
radio
and
cable
television
hispanic
immigrantbashing
news
shows
wants
to
reduce
legal
immigration
from
the
current
1
million
a
year
to
about
300000
with
a
20year
coolingoff
period

antiimmigration
advocates
are
not
antihispanic
maybe
many
arent
but
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
antiimmigration
republican
hopefuls
or
cable
television
talk
show
hosts
lashing
out
against
illegal
immigrants
from
canada
in
addition
the
escalating
immigration
hysteria
has
created
an
ugly
environment
that
affects
all
hispanics
both
legal
and
undocumented
in
many
parts
of
the
country
as
recent
studies
by
the
antidefamation
league
and
the
southern
poverty
law
center
have
shown
we
are
seeing
more
discrimination
and
harassment
says
michele
waslin
of
the
immigration
policy
center
anybody
who
is
hispaniclooking
or
has
an
hispanic
last
name
is
being
treated
as
an
undocumented
immigrant
149
myth
no

we
are
a
nation
of
laws
and
the
law
says
you
have
to
enter
the
country
legally
yes
but
we
are
also
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
by
the
way
nearly
half
of
all
undocumented
immigrants
enter
the
country
legally
and
overstay
their
visas
149
myth

building
a
border
fence
will
solve
the
problem
wrong
as
long
as
the
per
capita
income
in
the
united
states
is
five
times
bigger
than
that
of
mexico
and
as
long
as
us
labor
market
demands
millions
of
lowskilled
jobs
that
americans
wont
fill
people
will
jump
over
the
fence
dig
tunnels
under
it
or
come
through
canada
149
myth
no

those
of
us
who
criticize
antiimmigration
groups
are
amnesty
and
open
borders
supporters
baloney
many
support
both
border
protection
and
an
earned
path
to
legalization
for
millions
of
undocumented
workers
who
pay
taxes
and
are
willing
to
learn
english
so
lets
call
things
by
their
names
and
agree
that
most
opponents
of
a
comprehensive
immigration
package
are
antiimmigration
the
only
way
to
solve
the
current
immigration
crisis
will
be
to
legalize
undocumented
workers
who
have
paid
their
dues
and
to
increase
economic
integration
with
mexico
and
the
rest
of
latin
america
in
order
to
reduce
poverty
and
emigration
pressures
south
of
the
border
the
rest
is
for
the
most
part
populist
demagoguery
