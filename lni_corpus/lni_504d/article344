garner
sat
outside
a
hearing
room
nervously
awaiting
the
final
ruling
on
her
future
in
a
few
minutes
a
federal
immigration
judge
would
decide
whether
the
43yearold
nursing
aide
should
be
deported
to
her
sierra
leone
homeland
she
has
been
living
illegally
in
the
united
states
for
more
than
15
years
she
has
three
americanborn
children
and
a
husband
serving
with
the

garners

of

52
immigration
courts
which
until
recently
have
been
almost
unknown
outside
the
orbit
of
immigration
lawyers
their
clients
and
immigrant
advocacy
groups
these
administrative
courts
have
suddenly
risen
in
visibility
because
of
the
terrorist
investigation
immigration
judges
who
work
for
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
within
the
us
justice
department
have
ordered
460
foreigners
detained
for
immigration
law
and
visa
violations
since
the
sept
11
terrorist
attacks
these
courts
have
been
ruling
for
nearly
20
years
on
who
can
stay
and
who
should
leave
the
united
states
the
process
can
take
years
as
foreigners
and
their
lawyers
navigate
the
complicated
us
immigration
code
with
its
many
layers
of
special
provisions
that
congress
has
added
over
many
decades
a
complex
process
for
garner
the
journey
through
immigration
court
took
three
years
she
arrived
in
the
united
states
from
her
west
african
nation
in
1985
on
a
visitors
visa
and
never
left
after
she
applied
for
a
green
card
the
nickname
for
a
legal
permanent
residency
document
the
us
immigration
and
naturalization
service
investigated
her
and
discovered
she
had
had
two
brushes
with
the
law
while
in
her
20s
and
married
to
her
first
husband
garner
was
accused
of
spousal
abuse
a
charge
she
now
says
was
not
credible
because
her
thenhusband
was
a
hefty
sixfooter
in
the
mid1990s
she
had
a
dispute
with
a
used
car
dealer
who
demanded
that
she
return
a
car
for
lack
of
payment
when
she
refused
the
dealer
filed
theft
charges
which
she
did
not
contest
because
anyone
convicted
of
a
serious
felony
is
barred
from
having
a
green
card
she
was
facing
possible
deportation
dec
17
as
judge
jill
dupresne
in
baltimore
reviewed
the
last
remaining
documents
in
her
case
congratulations
and
best
wishes
the
judge
said
as
she
granted
permanent
resident
status
under
an
exception
for
immigrants
whose
deportation
would
be
a
severe
hardship
to
family
members
who
are
us
citizens
garner
gleefully
clasped
her
hands
together
your
honor
thank
you
she
said
giving
her
lawyer
high
fives
and
repeatedly
thanking
everyone
nearby
including
the
ins
lawyer
who
had
been
trying
to
deport
her
ive
been
thinking
of
this
for
three
years
she
said
as
she
celebrated
afterward
with
her
children
and
her
mother
and
left
to
email
her
husband
a
tank
mechanic
in
the
army

who
was
called
up
in
october
garners
lawyer
mohamed
sadu
bah
a
naturalized
american
also
born
in
sierra
leone
said
he
has
an
80
percent
success
rate
in
legalizing
his
clients
who
come
mostly
from
india
tanzania
and
west
africa
other
groups
especially
those
from
mexico
have
less
success
in
arguing
for
asylum
based
on
political
or
ethnic
persecution
he
said
nearly
all
the
approximately
250000
matters
that
come
before
immigration
courts
each
year
involve
immigrants
who
came
illegally
often
with
false
credentials
or
none
at
all
or
who
have
broken
criminal
laws
among
their
possible
routes
to
legalization
in
immigration
court
showing
evidence
from
their
employer
of
the
value
of
their
work
proving
family
ties
to
a
us
citizen
or
showing
that
they
should
be
granted
asylum
because
of
fear
of
persecution
if
they
are
sent
home
although
the
majority
fail
to
make
their
case
to
immigration
judges
or
fail
even
to
appear
for
hearings
the
odds
have
been
improving
slightly
in
decisions
made
in
fiscal
1996
the
judge
ordered
the
immigrant
removed
in
82
percent
of
the
cases
and
granted
relief
in
only
10
percent
by
fiscal
2000
the
removal
rate
dropped
to
79
percent
with
relief
ordered
in
15
percent
of
the
cases
more
getting
relief
an
increasing
number
of
immigrants
who
are
unsuccessful
in
making
their
case
to
ins
inspectors
are
finding
relief
in
immigration
court
in
fiscal
2000
immigration
courts
granted
asylum
to
9170
people
a
substantial
jump
from
the
5131
who
won
asylum
in
1996
federal
officials
including
immigration
court
spokesman
rick
kenney
say
they
cannot
explain
the
increase
at
least
one
possible
factor
is
the
energetic
corps
of
immigration
lawyers
who
have
highly
developed
arguments
about
persecution
their
clients
would
face
at
home
opposing
them
are
450
ins
lawyers
assigned
to
the
immigration
courts
deputy
ins
general
counsel
dea
carpenter
said
the
government
lawyers
are
spread
too
thin
we
have
less
time
to
prepare
each
case
than
we
would
like
she
said
noting
that
the
shortage
of
lawyers
restricts
how
much
factchecking
they
can
do
when
an
immigrant
seeks
asylum
in
a
recent
asylum
case
in
an
arlington
va
immigration
court
mariam
ahmed
omar
sat
in
the
witness
stand
her
hair
covered
with
a
plaid
cotton
cloth
the
covering
she
said
was
typical
of
her
shanshi
clan
a
lightskinned
group
her
lawyer
said
is
singled
out
for
attacks
in
her
native
somalia
speaking
through
an
interpreter
and
gesturing
constantly
with
her
hands
omar
52
related
how
her
family
was
forced
out
of
its
home
in
somalia
by
armed
militiamen
nearly
a
decade
ago
family
members
fled
to
kenya
where
her
husband
and
two
sons
still
live
she
said
about
a
year
ago
she
used
gold
she
had
kept
hidden
under
her
clothing
to
pay
a
smuggler
2000
to
provide
her
a
fake
kenyan
passport
and
a
flight
to
the
united
states
she
brought
no
supporting
witnesses
not
even
her
daughter
who
was
said
to
be
living
in
the
united
states
and
offered
little
corroboration
for
her
story
when
an
ins
lawyer
tried
to
pin
her
down
on
dates
and
places
she
responded
that
she
was
illiterate
and
did
not
know
dates
but
even
if
the
ruling
which
the
judge
said
he
would
announce
later
goes
against
the
asylum
request
omar
will
have
more
options
her
lawyer
ivan
yacub
said
he
expects
to
win
the
case
eventually
he
already
is
prepared
to
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
a
body
of
about
20
justice
department
reviewers
who
can
overturn
any
immigration
court
decision
ive
had
quite
a
streak
with
the
bia
yacub
said
adding
that
he
has
won
nine
of
10
appeals
on
behalf
of
somalians
when
he
goes
to
court
he
said
he
fashions
his
legal
arguments
for
the
appeals
board
i
think
what
would
the
bia
think
he
said
an
appeal
would
take
about
three
years
he
said
but
his
client
could
keep
her
temporary
residency
permit
as
she
pursued
her
case
if
the
appeals
board
turned
her
down
the
lawyer
could
appeal
again
in
federal
district
court
delay
delay
delay
critics
of
us
immigration
policies
see
the
immigration
courts
as
a
bureaucratic
obstacle
to
enforcing
the
law
the
one
goal
of
every
good
immigration
attorney
is
delay
delay
delay
said
mike
hethmon
counsel
for
the
federation
of
americans
for
immigration
reform
a
group
that
favors
restrictions
on
immigration
the
longer
your
client
stays
in
the
united
states
no
matter
what
theyve
done
to
merit
exclusion
chances
are
that
some
event
is
going
to
happen
to
allow
them
to
remain
permanently
however
angela
kelley
a
lawyer
with
the
proimmigrant
national
immigration
forum
dismissed
the
suggestion
that
lawyers
were
intentionally
delaying
cases
the
vast
majority
of
lawyers
are
representing
their
clients
well
and
pursuing
the
legal
avenues
available
in
the
face
of
laws
that
are
growing
stricter
