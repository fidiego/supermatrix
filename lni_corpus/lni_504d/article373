a
thomas
esparza
jr
a
certified
specialist
in
immigration
law
is
not
telling
his
clients
about
the
immigration
reforms
pending
in
congress
im
not
the
type
of
person
to
terrorize
my
clients
with
every
little
thing
that
congress
proposes
esparza
said
from
his
office
in
austin
texas
terrorizing
they
may
be
little
theyre
not
the
immigration
reform
bills
headed
for
a
vote
this
week
in
the
house
and
next
month
in
the
senate
would
make
the
most
wideranging
changes
in
federal
immigration
law
in
decades
they
could
add
thousands
of
border
patrol
agents
to
the
beat
deny
admission
to
political
refugees
who
cannot
prove
their
persecution
claims
within
hours
of
arriving
and
knock
one
of
esparzas
clients
off
an
immigration
waiting
list
hes
been
on
for
12
years
the
bills
could
also
include
the
first
cuts
in
the
number
of
foreigners
entering
the
country
legally
since
the
1920s
and
restrict
immigrants
access
to
some
social
services
the
breadth
of
the
bills
with
their
mix
of
fixes
for
legal
and
illegal
immigration
could
doom
them
in
both
houses
of
congress
the
senate
judiciary
committee
voted
thursday
to
split
the
senate
version
into
two
parts
one
each
dealing
with
legal
and
illegal
immigration
amendments
in
both
of
those
areas
added
and
subtracted
large
pieces
of
wouldbe
law
the
lead
sponsor
of
the
house
bill
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
is
calm
about
his
bills
prospects
in
the
face
of
the
coming
storm
of
colleagues
amendments
itll
pass
he
said
mostly
intact
as
it
stands
smiths
bill
encompasses
enough
changes
to
immigration
law
to
make
a
lot
of
people
unhappy
proimmigration
groups
are
appalled
at
the
proposed
30
percent
reduction
in
the
number
of
family
members
who
could
join
legal
immigrants
in
the
united
states
human
rights
groups
object
to
the
proposed
50
percent
cut
in
refugee
admissions
business
groups
particularly
those
representing
the
hightech
industry
are
peeved
at
the
idea
of
a
slight
reduction
in
the
number
of
immigrants
who
could
be
admitted
for
specific
jobs
smith
is
happy
just
to
get
his
bill
on
the
table
for
eight
years
he
toiled
in
the
house
minority
party
when
the
republicans
won
control
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
smith
won
a
promotion
to
chairman
of
the
house
immigration
subcommittee
a
position
that
let
him
draft
and
direct
a
reform
program
he
thought
was
long
overdue
he
said
his
constituents
feel
the
same
way
the
one
issue
i
get
the
most
applause
on
the
most
questions
about
is
immigration
he
said
very
few
issues
elicit
such
strong
responses
why
do
smiths
constituents
feel
so
strongly
i
think
they
see
every
day
in
their
lives
the
manifest
effects
of
a
broken
immigration
system
he
said
whether
its
bulging
schools
or
crowded
emergency
rooms
maybe
its
crime
people
see
it
they
feel
it
theyre
impacted
smiths
bill
would
cut
federal
reimbursement
to
hospitals
for
emergency
medical
care
of
illegal
immigrants
thus
requiring
the
hospitals
to
verify
a
patients
immigration
status
but
it
doesnt
address
public
schools
open
to
immigrant
children
through
grade
12
regardless
of
legal
status
and
the
crime
that
concerns
his
constituents
is
only
glancingly
addressed
in
provisions
dealing
with
terrorists
and
requiring
quick
deportations
of
illegalalien
criminals
after
serving
prison
sentences
smith
is
aware
of
the
bills
shortcomings
you
dont
always
get
a
whole
loaf
he
said
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
the
demographics
of
immigration
dramatically
raise
the
political
stakes
of
this
debate
in
a
presidential
election
year
fueling
much
of
this
debate
are
two
questions
do
immigrants
displace
americans
in
the
job
market
and
do
immigrants
receive
more
in
public
assistance
than
us
citizens
some
studies
suggest
that
although
immigrants
may
not
take
away
jobs
in
fact
in
many
cases
they
create
new
ones
they
reduce
the
prospects
for
lowerskilled
workers
in
weak
local
economies
the
welfare
question
is
just
as
muddied
each
side
uses
definitions
of
public
assistance
and
census
information
that
supports
its
point
the
urban
institute
a
nonpartisan
research
organization
says
that
95
percent
of
immigrants
do
not
receive
welfare
but
george
borjas
a
professor
of
public
policy
at
harvard
universitys
john
f
kennedy
school
of
government
says
that
21
percent
of
immigrant
households
receive
some
type
of
public
assistance
compared
with
14
percent
of
native
households
more
than
70
percent
of
the
nations
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
live
in
six
large
voterrich
states
a
california
texas
florida
new
york
new
jersey
and
illinois
a
where
many
officials
are
worried
that
immigrants
unduly
burden
local
services
in
california
for
example
immigrants
make
up
21
percent
of
all
households
but
receive
40
percent
of
public
assistance
such
as
medicaid
food
stamps
and
housing
subsidies
but
some
republican
strategists
fear
the
immigration
bills
could
backfire
by
angering
vast
numbers
of
potential
voters
who
are
sponsoring
nearly
2
million
family
members
on
waiting
lists
in
visa
categories
that
could
be
eliminated
the
political
drama
is
set
against
the
nations
largest
influx
of
immigrants
since
the
turn
of
the
century
nearly
10
million
immigrants
have
taken
up
residence
in
the
united
states
legally
in
the
past
10
years
including
3
million
illegal
aliens
who
were
given
amnesty
under
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act
as
lawmakers
debate
these
arguments
there
has
been
intense
pressure
and
maneuvering
from
special
interest
groups
including
an
unlikely
alliance
of
high
technology
companies
grassroots
immigrant
groups
and
civil
liberties
organizations
opposed
to
the
congressional
proposals
smith
amended
one
section
of
his
bill
to
make
it
more
palatable
to
business
he
had
originally
proposed
a
mandatory
pilot
program
requiring
employers
in
five
states
to
verify
with
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
job
applicants
are
citizens
or
legal
immigrants
his
amendment
would
make
the
verification
program
voluntary
available
nationwide
sen
alan
simpson
rwyo
scrapped
a
section
of
his
bill
that
would
have
severely
restricted
us
companies
hiring
of
temporary
immigrant
workers
by
setting
higher
salaries
and
imposing
annual
fees
of
10000
or
more
per
foreign
worker
he
said
business
groups
distortions
of
its
intent
were
distracting
other
senators
from
considering
the
whole
bill
simpson
had
thought
that
removing
the
foreignworker
restrictions
would
end
the
business
groups
push
to
divide
the
senate
bill
into
separate
measures
dealing
with
legal
and
illegal
immigration
he
was
proved
wrong
thursday
with
the
immigration
subcommittees
vote
to
do
just
that
the
strength
of
the
argument
for
splitting
the
bill
is
evident
in
the
reaction
of
the
two
republican
senators
from
texas
that
state
has
the
thirdlargest
population
of
illegal
immigrants
among
the
50
states
with
about
10
percent
of
the
estimated
total
of
35
million
to
4
million
illegal
immigrants
nationwide
as
a
consequence
texas
republican
sens
kay
bailey
hutchison
and
phil
gramm
want
to
see
congress
do
something
about
illegal
immigration
before
it
even
thinks
about
legal
immigration
we
should
focus
on
illegal
immigration
first
hutchison
said
that
is
what
is
costing
our
state
and
our
country
so
much
hutchisons
proposal
to
require
fingerprinting
of
all
illegal
immigrants
caught
by
the
border
patrol
has
been
added
to
the
senate
bill
and
shes
pushing
for
a
10year
ban
on
any
immigrant
who
once
entered
the
united
states
illegally
gramm
wants
to
encourage
legal
immigration
i
for
one
am
not
ready
to
tear
down
the
statue
of
liberty
for
over
300
years
we
have
been
the
source
of
a
brain
drain
on
the
world
where
we
have
attracted
through
legal
immigration
talented
people
to
come
to
america
i
cant
understand
why
we
want
the
next
albert
einstein
to
live
anywhere
else
but
austin
or
college
station
the
senate
bills
arent
expected
to
come
to
a
vote
of
the
full
senate
for
another
month
with
the
proposals
on
illegal
immigration
coming
up
first
legal
immigration
remains
a
sticky
issue
simpson
has
been
very
vocal
about
ending
socalled
chain
migration
that
he
says
enables
immigrants
to
bring
in
40
50

i
think
the
record
is

a
relatives
if
they
have
an
example
of
that
id
love
to
see
it
said
charlotte
mccann
of
the
human
rights
documentation
exchange
in
austin
thats
rhetoric
that
i
know
has
been
promoted
by
immigration
restrictionists
thats
misrepresenting
whats
happening
youre
not
applying
for
a
cousin
you
cant
apply
for
an
aunt
and
you
cant
apply
for
an
uncle
now
its
going
to
be
hard
to
even
bring
in
your
mother
and
father
if
this
bill
passes
mccann
said
the
if
may
be
answered
this
week
in
the
house
ending
the
to
and
fro
that
has
made
life
harder
for
people
like
thomas
esparza
and
his
clients
peoples
lives
peoples
futures
are
being
traded
back
and
forth
in

halls
of
congress
esparza
said
its
a
real
shame
to
see
my
people
and
people
from
other
countries
used
as
stepping
