no

is
the
eliteamerican
divide
so
great
as
on
immigration
for
decades
a
majority
of
americans
have
wanted
to
decrease
immigration
not
just
illegal
immigration
all
immigration
nearly
three
times
as
many
americans
support
reducing
immigration
as
want
it
to
stay
the
same
according
to
gallup
polls
a
grand
total
of
5
percent
of
the
population
want
to
increase
legal
immigration
10
times
less
than
want
to
decrease
it
i
myself
would
like
to
deport
the
people
responsible
for
our
current
immigration
policies
our
official
policy
is
to
turn
away
scientists
in
order
to
make
room
for
illiterate
pakistani
peasants
who
will
drop
out
of
high
school
to
man
coffee
carts
until
deciding
to
plot
a
terrorist

believe
me
our

officials
said
welcome
zazi
oops
sorry
swedish
scientists
and
nuclear
engineers
no
room
for
you
in
february
zazi
pleaded
guilty
in
a
plot
to
bomb
the
new
york
city
subway
for
this
we
can
thank
the
late
lamented
teddy
kennedy
who
altered
our
immigration
laws
in
1965
to
ensure
massive
immigration
from
the
third
world
while
severely
limiting
the
number
of
europeans
who
could
come
here
and
thats
legal
immigration
when
it
comes
to
illegal
immigration
americans
are
in
a
sputtering
rage
about
politicians
obtuse
refusal
to
address
the
problem
democrats
look
at
immigration
as
a
way
to
increase
their
voter
rolls
and
republicans
look
at
immigration
as
a
way
to
get
cheap
labor
for
big
business
any
americans
who
disagree
with
our
allthird
world
immigration
flow
are
called
racists
this
is
why
democrats
and
establishment
republicans
are
desperate
to
talk
mitt
romney
into
flipflopping
on
his
immigration
positions
hes
with
americans
in
a
novel
thought
romney
proposes
that
we
grant
citizenship
to
people
who
would
make
america
a
better
place
repeatedly
saying
that
he
would
like
to
staple
a
green
card
to
the
diplomas
of
foreigners
who
receive
phds
in
math
or
the
hard
sciences
he
may
be
the
first
national
politician
in
two
generations
who
thinks
we
should
use
legal
immigration
to
get
our
average
up
it
would
be
as
if
the
university
of
north
carolina
recruited
only
the
top
basketball
players
in
the
country
instead
of
out
of
fairness
taking
players
of
all
skill
levels
and
their
relatives
what
they
already
do
that
way
to
go
carolina
romney
is
also
one
of
the
few
politicians
who
acknowledge
the
danger
of
creating
magnets
for
more
illegal
aliens
streaming
across
the
border
i
would
add
that
the
absolute
worst
thing
we
could
do
is
grant
citizenship
to
illegal
immigrant
children
brought
here
by
their
parents
as
the
various
dream
acts
do
what
stronger
magnet
could
we
devise
than
offering
citizenship
to
a
persons
children
instead
of
drafting
bills
to
give
illegal
aliens
benefits
cant
we
all
agree
that
the
very
first
thing
we
have
to
do
is
seal
the
border
otherwise
its
like
mopping
the
floor
before
turning
off
the
bathtub
spigot
first
turn
off
spigot
second
mop
floor
third
fix
the
faucet
and
surely
no
one
wants
any
immigrants
coming
here
and
immediately
going
on
welfare
cant
we
all
agree
not
to
give
immigrants
government
handouts
starting
with
those
two
policies
is
not
only
logical
but
will
force
democrats
to
admit
they
have
no
intention
of
ever
blocking
the
border
their
dearest
desire
is
for
immigrants
to
arrive
become
dependent
on
government
and
start
voting
