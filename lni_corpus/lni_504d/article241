for
an

on
how
complex
immigration
law
has
become
look
no
further
than
one
of
the
most
respected
books
on
the
subject
immigration
law
and
procedure
charles
gordon
a
former
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
first
published
the
treatise
in
1959
when
vance
winningham
the
dean
of
oklahoma
immigration
attorneys
started
work
there
were
four
volumes
these
days
the
book
frequently
called
the
bible
of
immigration
law
stretches
to
20
volumes
and
in
the
last
10
years
membership
in
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
has
more
than
doubled
to
more
than
11000
attorneys
when
i
came
out
of
law
school
immigration
law
wasnt
taught
at
many
schools
said
winningham
who
received
his
law
degree
at
the
university
of
oklahoma
now
its
hard
to
find
a
law
school
where
thats
not
a
class
despite
national
growth
in
the
specialization
the
number
of
immigration
attorneys
in
oklahoma
remains
small
by
comparison
but
demand
for
their
services
has
grown
with
new
federal
regulations
and
oklahomas
immigration
law
house
bill
1804
which
went
into
effect
last
week
learning
the
law
winningham
got
into
immigration
law
the
oldfashioned
way
by
accident
not
long
after
law
school
he
invested
in
an
oil
rig
in
libya
in
the
late
1960s
and
was
making
frequent
trips
to
the
north
african
country
for
business
during
one
of
the
trips
a
friend
and
new
york
immigration
attorney
convinced
him
to
take
the
immigration
case
of
a
hong
kong
tailor
who
wanted
to
come
to
america
after
my
first
case
i
swore
id
never
do
another
one
but
they
started
calling
and
i
started
going
to
seminars
said
winningham
who
founded
winningham
stein
at
the
time
only
a
handful
of
oklahoma
attorneys
were
knowledgeable
about
immigration
law
he
said
before
that
much
of
the
work
was
farmed
out
to
law
firms
in
los
angeles
houston
new
york
or
miami
places
that
had
a
long
history
of
immigration
and
its
related
issues
winningham
spent
a
lot
of
his
early
days
mailing
correspondence
and
applications
to
the
federal
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
dallas
it
wasnt
until
the
1980s
that
the
ins
established
a
branch
office
in
oklahoma
city
a
new
era
doug
stump
an
attorney
with
stump
associates
has
been
practicing
immigration
law
for
24
years
relations
with
federal
officials
in
his
early
years
were
much
more
cordial
he
said
in
that
era
the
immigration
office
seemed
much
more
focused
on
assisting
the
foreign
national
and
qualifying
for
a
benefit
that
would
allow
them
to
remain
in
the
country
lawfully
stump
said
the
law
has
become
much
more
complex
and
its
become
much
less
employerfriendly
when
stump
graduated
from
law
school
in
1982
he
interviewed
with
several
law
firms
in
oklahoma
city
he
soon
realized
he
didnt
want
to
practice
general
civil
law
immigration
law
provided
me
access
to
different
cultures
and
it
seemed
very
exciting
at
the
time
stump
said
my
practice
back
then
was
pretty
well
balanced
between
employmentbased
immigration
law
and
familybased
law
with
some
exposure
to
complex
deportation
cases
oklahoma
city
attorney
michael
brooksjimenez
came
to
immigration
law
through
his
legal
work
in
the
spanishspeaking
community
when
he
graduated
from
ous
law
school
in
1995
he
realized
not
many
attorneys
in
oklahoma
catered
to
the
spanish
market
brooksjimenez
started
learning
spanish
first
by
taking
his
mothers
conversational
spanish
class
at
oklahoma
city
community
college
and
then
by
taking
a
spanishimmersion
trip
to
mexico
also
making
that
trip
was
his
future
wife
jessica
at
some
point
during
the
trip
i
began
to
think
in
spanish
and
it
really
clicked
for
me
brooksjimenez
said
once
i
got
back
i
began
putting
advertising
announcements
in
spanishlanguage
newspapers
and
on
radio
stations
good
timing
in
1996
congress
passed
tighter
restrictions
to
an
immigration
law
that
had
been
significantly
reformed
a
decade
earlier
with
the
passage
of
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
whenever
i
started
in
1996
the
immigration
law
had
been
completely
overhauled
brooksjimenez
said
it
was
kind
of
a
blessing
and
a
curse
there
were
limitations
in
what
you
could
do
for
clients
but
at
the
same
time
it
kind
of
leveled
the
playing
field
because
nobody
really
knew
how
this
new
law
was
going
to
be
applied
although
those
federal
laws
have
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
a
decade
the
enforcement
of
them
changed
after
the
sept
11
2001
terrorist
attacks
and
with
the
creation
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
said
byrona
maule
a
shareholder
and
director
at
phillips
mcfall
in
oklahoma
city
the
former
ins
was
moved
into
that
new
department
and
renamed
the
united
states
customs
and
immigration
service
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
division
was
created
in
2003
its
the
manner
of
enforcement
and
interpretation
of
those
laws
since
the
formation
of
dhs
department
of
homeland
security
that
has
really
changed
how
its
impacted
everyone
maule
said
in
many
ways
the
burden
has
shifted
as
to
whose
responsibility
it
is
to
enforce
it
a
lot
of
the
responsibility
to
enforce
these
laws
is
now
being
moved
to
employers
landlords
hospitals
and
schools
when
you
look
at
the
oklahoma
statute
thats
kind
of
whats
happening
adding
staff
meanwhile
oklahoma
city
law
firm
crowe
dunlevy
this
fall
added
its
first
fulltime
immigration
attorney
jasmine
majid
immigration
issues
had
been
handled
by
the
firms
labor
and
employment
attorneys
said
mike
stewart
a
shareholder
and
chairman
of
the
firms
business
practice
group
its
an
area
weve
wanted
to
employ
somebody
in
for
several
years
but
just
hadnt
found
the
particular
individual
who
seemed
to
fit
our
group
until
jasmine
steward
said
with
the
advent
of
state
law
and
some
of
the
things
going
on
in
the
federal
level
there
are
more
general
immigration
compliance
issues
for
all
employers
that
now
exist
that
havent
existed
in
the
past
tulsa
immigration
lawyer
mark
solano
jokes
that
immigration
law
is
second
only
to
tax
law
in
its
complexity
winningham
argues
that
its
more
complex
with
an
alphabet
soup
of
federal
agencies
to
deal
with
for
the
law
and
its
many
regulations
throw
the
new
state
law
into
the
mix
and
it
means
a
lot
of
studying
and
continuing
education
i
actually
spend
more
time
studying
now
than
i
did
in
law
school
winningham
said
i
sit
here
for
several
hours
a
day
just
sifting
through
the
interpretations
and
whats
happening
a
new
focus
crystal
williams
deputy
director
for
programs
at
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
in
washington
said
the
complexity
is
causing
many
immigration
attorneys
to
focus
their
practices
in
a
particular
type
of
immigration
law
that
is
something
that
has
always
been
around
to
some
extent
but
we
are
seeing
more
concentration
on
one
part
such
as
just
physicians
or
just
on
hightech
visas
or
just
on
asylum
or
removal
work
williams
said
were
seeing
a
vast
increase
in
that
having
to
do
with
the
information
overload
its
just
easier
to
keep
up
with
one
thing
rather
than
the
whole
field
