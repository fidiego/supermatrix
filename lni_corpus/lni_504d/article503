fraudulent
schemes
to
obtain
visas

immigration
lawyers

immigration
lawyers
say
the
governments
assertions
about
the
extent
of
fraud
are
unproved
and
the
investigations
are
meant
to
discourage
lawyers
from
representating
aliens
vigorously
they
also
strenuously
object
to
the
governments
investigative
tactics
the
government
has
already
brought
charges
or
taken
other
legal
actions
against
some
lawyers
dale
m
schwartz
of
atlanta
presidentelect
of
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
was
recently
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
on
eight
counts
of
mail
fraud
and
false
statements
in
a
case
involving
a
british
businessman
who
came
to
the
united
states
to
work
for
an
american
aerospace
company
release
of
3000
cubans
mr
schwartz
pleaded
not
guilty
last
week
in
the
last
four
years
he
has
become
prominent
by
representing
cubans
who
resist
deportation
as
a
result
of
his
efforts
more
than
3000
cubans
have
been
released
from
the
federal
penitentiary
in
atlanta
in
houston
two
lawyers
were
recently
sentenced
to
18
months
in
federal
prison
after
they
pleaded
guilty
to
three
criminal
counts
arising
from
what
was
termed
a
fraudulent
scheme
to
get
work
visas
for
clients
in
boston
a
federal
grand
jury
has
subpoenaed
the
records
of
a
private
law
firm
and
a
legal
service
clinic
staffed
by
harvard
law
students
who
help
represent
aliens
in
immigration
cases
a
federal
district
judge
quashed
the
subpoena
as
a
violation
of
attorneyclient
confidentiality
the
justice
department
has
asked
the
judge
to
reconsider
saying
the
files
might
show
that
the
lawyers
helped
their
clients
make
false
statements
commit
perjury
and
evade
the
immigration
law
the
government
says
the
lawyers
may
have
turned
a
blind
eye
to
obvious
indications
of
their
clients
fraud
deborah
e
anker
an
instructor
at
the
clinic
and
at
harvard
law
school
denied
the
allegations
and
said
that
such
subpoenas
would
discourage
lawyers
from
aggressively
representing
aliens
an
already
vulnerable
and
underrepresented
class
sam
bernsen
a
retired
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
said
it
is
highly
questionable
whether
these
alleged
violations
are
really
criminal
in
nature
the
immigration
law
is
monstrously
complex
much
of
it
depends
on
the
aliens
intent
whether
he
intends
to
come
here
temporarily
or
permanently
john
f
shaw
chief
of
investigations
for
the
immigration
service
said
the
agency
was
focusing
on
two
types
of
abuse
marriage
fraud
which
occurs
when
an
alien
engages
in
a
sham
marriage
to
an
american
citizen
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
and
false
statements
to
help
an
alien
enter
the
united
states
for
a
specific
job
permanent
visas
to
workers
before
aliens
can
get
permanent
visas
to
work
in
the
united
states
the
labor
department
must
determine
whether
americans
are
available
to
do
the
job
the
alien
would
take
and
whether
employing
the
alien
would
adversely
affect
americans
wages
and
working
conditions
in
similar
jobs
if
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
no
the
department
issues
a
labor
certification
facilitating
the
aliens
entry
the
government
contends
that
in
many
cases
employers
and
their
attorneys
have
improperly
written
job
descriptions
to
eliminate
qualified
american
workers
from
consideration
michael
f
treworgy
regional
inspector
general
of
the
labor
department
in
dallas
said
that
in
his
region
which
covers
11
states
the
authorities
are
investigating
more
than
a
dozen
cases
of
suspected
fraud
involving
lawyers
aliens
and
employers
agents
of
the
labor
department
the
immigration
service
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
are
cooperating
on
similar
inquiries
in
other
parts
of
the
country
according
to
their
officials
gimmicking
the
system
we
did
not
intend
to
single
out
immigration
lawyers
mr
shaw
said
we
are
looking
at
fraudulent
petitions
for
benefits
under
the
immigration
law
if
that
leads
to
lawyers
so
be
it
we
look
on
many
members
of
the
immigration
bar
as
people
who
are
gimmicking
the
system
immigration
lawyers
acknowledged
that
it
was
the
governments
duty
to
investigate
wrongdoing
but
several
said
they
were
furious
about
the
tactics
federal
agents
used
to
question
the
lawyers
allen
e
kaye
of
new
york
city
a
former
president
of
the
immigration
lawyers
association
said
that
federal
agents
had
tried
to
gain
the
cooperation
of
aliens
and
employers
by
telling
them
in
effect
we
are
investigating
your
lawyer
not
you
he
said
the
agents
also
urged
the
clients
not
to
tell
their
lawyers
they
had
been
interviewed
by
federal
agents
maurice
c
inman
the
current
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
said
the
indictment
of
mr
schwartz
was
definitely
not
related
to
his
representing
the
cubans
but
mr
schwartz
said
these
investigations
of
lawyers
have
no
real
purpose
other
than
to
intimidate
attorneys
and
their
clients
and
thus
to
deprive
aliens
and
their
sponsors
of
the
effective
assistance
