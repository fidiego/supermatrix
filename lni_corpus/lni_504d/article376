allies
a
senate
panel
yesterday
voted
to
split
a
controversial
immigration
reform
bill
in
a
move
that
complicates
congressional
efforts
to
cut
back
on
legal
immigrants
by
a
12
to
6
vote
the
senate
judiciary
committee
adopted
an
amendment
sponsored
by
sen
spencer
abraham
rmich
that
divides
the
bills
provisions
on
legal
and
illegal
immigration
into
two
separate
pieces
of
legislation
the
action
taken
over
the
objections
of
the
bills
sponsor
sen
alan
k
simpson
rwyo
dealt
a
major
blow
to
proposals
aimed
at
reducing
legal
immigration
for
employment
and
family
reunification
while
unlikely
to
survive
in
the
committee
the
measures
appear
headed
for
a
divisive
debate
among
republicans
on
the
senate
floor
the
vote
to
split
the
bill
was
applauded
by
business
leaders
and
a
coalition
of
religious
ethnic
and
proimmigration
groups
but
criticized
by
advocates
of
lower
immigration
clinton
administration
officials
expressed
concern
that
the
end
result
could
be
to
weaken
protections
for
american
workers
by
splitting
the
measures
into
two
bills
lawmakers
can
now
vote
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigrants
without
restricting
the
highlyskilled
foreign
workers
who
help
create
more
jobs
for
all
americans
said
paul
huard
a
vice
president
of
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
simpson
who
is
retiring
this
year
after
18
years
in
the
senate
insisted
that
the
vote
was
not
a
setback
and
that
legal
immigration
currently
running
at
about
775000
a
year
will
be
addressed
in
some
way
by
the
senate
the
issue
will
not
go
away
he
said
the
president
wants
to
deal
with
it
senate
republican
leader
bob
dole
wants
to
deal
with
it
everybody
in
america
wants
to
deal
with
it
abraham
said
his
goal
was
never
to
kill
reform
of
legal
immigration
only
to
divorce
it
from
a
crackdown
on
illegal
aliens
and
consider
it
in
a
cooler
environment
he
said
it
was
important
not
to
let
a
good
illegal
immigration
bill
drag
along
a
poor
legal
immigration
bill
he
has
expressed
opposition
to
the
simpson
bills
proposed
cuts
in
employmentbased
immigration
from
140000
available
visas
a
year
to
90000
and
to
reductions
in
family
immigration
by
24
percent
in
the
first
five
years
and
up
to
43
percent
after
that
simpson
reiterated
his
intention
to
delete
all
provisions
relating
to
employment
immigration
saying
he
was
tired
of
trying
to
accommodate
the
business
community
sen
edward
m
kennedy
dmass
who
voted
to
split
simpsons
bill
has
said
he
nevertheless
wants
to
keep
measures
he
believes
protect
american
workers
from
an
influx
of
foreigners
under
a
program
of
temporary
nonimmigrant
visas
were
going
to
continue
to
push
for
worker
protections
said
labor
secretary
robert
b
reich
the
president
feels
very
strongly
about
this
he
feels
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
employers
should
be
allowed
to
fire
american
workers
and
bring
in
foreign
temps
to
replace
them
with
lower
wages
and
benefits
rep
lamar
s
smith
rtex
the
sponsor
of
a
house
immigration
bill
scheduled
for
debate
next
week
criticized
the
split
saying
that
most
americans
want
an
overhaul
of
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
our
current
immigration
laws
are
broken
and
must
be
fixed
smith
said
those
who
are
unwilling
to
address
the
crisis
in
legal
immigration
cannot
be
serious
about
cutting
illegal
immigration
yesterdays
vote
represents
a
setback
for
senator
simpson
and
his
allies
but
it
is
not
a
death
knell
said
attorney
rick
swartz
a
prominent
proimmigration
advocate
it
significantly
increases
the
chances
but
does
not
guarantee
that
legal
immigration
reform
will
be
deferred
until
after
the
election
mark
krikorian
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
and
a
critic
of
current
immigration
levels
expressed
worry
that
the
senate
would
produce
only
a
very
watereddown
minor
bill
citing
polls
that
he
said
show
public
frustration
with
immigration
he
added
the
more
congress
tries
to
stick
its
head
in
the
sand
the
stronger
the
backlash
is
going
to
be
there
are
just
going
to
be
more

republican

buchanan
has
called
for
tough
measures
against
illegal

and
