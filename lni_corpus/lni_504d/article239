most
americans
clearly
want
their
government
to
secure
the
borders
and
enforce
immigration
laws
they
understand
what
many
elected
officials
still
dont
rewarding
lawbreakers
with
amnesty
only
encourages
a
new
flood
of
illegal
immigrants
in
september
new
york
democratic
gov
eliot
spitzer
announced
a
plan
to
allow
illegal
immigrants
to
obtain
new
york
drivers
licenses
the
proposal
has
been
sharply
criticized
across
the
nation
a
recent
poll
found
77
percent
of
americans
oppose
drivers
licenses
for
illegal
immigrants
despite
overwhelming
opposition
the
proposal
still
has
supporters
including
many
of
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
democratic
presidential
hopeful
sen
hillary
clinton
of
new
york
found
out
the
hard
way
that
the
american
people
are
unwilling
to
accept
anything
but
a
public
denouncement
of
this
proposal
the
public
outcry
ultimately
forced
mr
spitzer
to
withdraw
his
proposal
but
the
damage
was
done
with
the
2008
elections
less
than
a
year
away
senior
democratic
leaders
and
members
of
congress
are
desperately
trying
to
strike
the
right
tone
on
immigration
but
efforts
by
democrats
to
toughen
talking
points
against
illegal
immigration
are
disingenuous
at
best
in
fact
democrats
and
various
interest
groups
have
never
been
serious
about
reducing
illegal
immigration
in
the
last
two
years
an
overwhelming
majority
of
house
democrats
voted
against
almost
every
piece
of
legislation
aimed
at
reducing
illegal
immigration
for
example
80
percent
said
no
to
enhanced
border
security
and
increased
enforcement
of
laws
prohibiting
the
employment
of
illegal
immigrants
the
proposed
bill
required
the
use
of
a
basic
pilot
program
which
helps
employers
determine
whether
their
employees
are
legal
74
percent
said
no
to
national
security
standards
for
drivers
licenses
to
prevent
alien
terrorists
from
getting
identification
documents
the
real
id
act
aimed
at
keeping
out
and
removing
alien
terrorists
from
the
us
63
percent
said
no
to
strengthening
border
security
by
constructing
reinforced
fences
along
the
usmexico
border
senate
democrats
also
have
refused
to
reduce
illegal
immigration
for
example
75
percent
said
no
to
enforcing
immigration
laws
before
beginning
the
legalization
process
for
the
12
million
illegal
immigrants
now
in
the
us
by
opposing
the
commonsense
coburn
amendment
many
democrats
rejected
the
american
publics
call
for
immigration
enforcement
86
percent
said
no
to
increasing
the
number
of
detention
beds
allowing
for
the
confinement
of
illegal
immigrants
to
ensure
their
appearance
for
immigration
hearings
84
percent
said
no
to
funding
800
more
immigration
investigators
ompare
those
numbers
to
the
69
percent
of
americans
who
said
they
want
illegal
immigration
reduced
refusing
to
enforce
immigration
laws
simply
maintains
the
status
quo
democratic
proposals
that
reward
illegal
immigration
like
gov
spitzers
plan
in
new
york
only
exacerbate
the
problem
and
encourage
illegal
immigration
reducing
illegal
immigration
requires
increased
border
security
effective
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
and
an
end
to
the
job
magnet
that
entices
illegal
immigrants
to
come
here
and
stay
the
administration
has
begun
to
respond
to
the
convictions
expressed
by
the
american
people
but
their
efforts
are
blocked
by
interest
groups
like
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
the
aflcio
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
who
filed
a
lawsuit
to
block
the
implementation
of
a
key
enforcement
measure
specifically
they
hope
to
block
the
homeland
security
departments
no
match
rule
designed
to
identify
illegal
immigrants
using
fraudulent
social
security
numbers
to
obtain
jobs
it
is
no
surprise
that
these
same
groups
favor
amnesty
the
american
people
understand
that
illegal
immigration
is
just
that
illegal
they
understand
laws
are
meaningless
unless
enforced
but
they
cant
understand
why
so
many
elected
officials
pay
lipservice
to
immigration
enforcement
back
home
while
voting
against
it
in
washington
on
illegal
immigration
its
time
for
democrats
to
take
a
lesson
in
civics
101
and
start
representing
the
views
of
the
american
people
its
time
congress
got
serious
about
immigration
enforcement
