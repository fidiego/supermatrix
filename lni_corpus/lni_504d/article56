the
need
for
an
immigration
court
has
been
obvious
but
it
has
gone
unmet
as
major
immigrationreform
legislation
moves
through
congress
now
is
the
time
to
create
the
court
under
terms
in
article
1
of
the
us
constitution
it
may
not
be
a
sensational
topic
or
one
that
inspires
heated
debate
but
it
is
essential
to
reform
it
has
widespread
support
in
the
legal
community
and
it
would
result
in
enhanced
due
process
protections
and
provide
an
enforcement
mechanism
which
would
reduce
appeals
and
delay
today
immigration
judges
are
classified
as
attorneys
working
for
the
justice
department
in
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
they
are
highly
specialized
with
tremendous
responsibilities
but
with
no
true
judicial
independence
immigration
courts
are
the
triallevel
tribunals
that
determine
if
an
individual
is
in
the
united
states
illegally
and
if
so
whether
there
is
any
status
or
benefit
to
which
the
individual
is
entitled
most
frequently
matters
before
immigration
judges
are
initiated
by
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
trial
attorneys
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
seeking
deportation
or
removal
of
an
individual
caseloads
are
at
an
alltime
high
currently
there
are
approximately
327000
cases
pending
for
256
immigration
judges
nationwide
an
average
of
1277
pending
cases
per
judge
compared
with
440
per
us
district
court
judge
immigration
courts
are
dramatically
understaffed
one
judicial
law
clerk
for
every
four
judges
unlike
district
court
judges
who
have
two
or
three
per
judge
sixty
percent
of
respondents
are
unrepresented
by
counsel
and
85
percent
of
detained
respondents
are
unrepresented
because
these
are
civil
proceedings
with
no
right
to
counsel
despite
the
high
stakes
for
those
involved
one
can
only
imagine
how
dramatically
this
caseload
will
increase
after
the
enactment
of
a
new
immigrationreform
law
within
the
executive
office
for
immigration
review
there
is
a
board
of
immigration
appeals
where
decisions
of
immigration
courts
may
be
reviewed
and
policy
set
at
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
applies
to
all
persons
including
aliens
in
considerable
measure
because
immigration
judges
are
not
independent
and
there
are
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
federal
circuit
courts
of
appeal
are
flooded
with
requests
for
review
of
immigration
cases
despite
legislation
passed
more
than
15
years
ago
granting
it
immigration
judges
have
no
contempt
authority
because
the
justice
department
has
refused
to
allow
them
to
use
it
this
appears
to
come
from
an
aversion
to
allowing
immigration
judges
who
are
justice
department
attorneys
to
discipline
department
of
homeland
security
attorneys
who
prosecute
immigration
cases
subpoenas
issued
by
immigration
judges
go
unenforced
when
directed
at
homeland
security
attorneys
because
us
attorneys
wont
pick
sides
between
the
two
sibling
agencies
it
is
not
unusual
for
immigration
judges
to
face
personal
discipline
when
making
goodfaith
legal
decisions
because
the
justice
department
responds
to
complaints
from
disgruntled
parties
the
appropriate
recourse
would
be
an
appeal
the
basis
of
most
complaints
against
immigration
judges
relate
to
their
decisions
not
to
allegations
of
conflict
of
interest
or
personal
gain
by
the
judge
these
judges
can
also
be
subjected
to
personal
discipline
for
not
meeting
the
administrative
priorities
of
their
supervisors
in
the
justice
department
and
may
be
placed
in
the
position
of
having
to
choose
between
risking
their
jobs
and
exercising
independent
decisionmaking
authority
the
only
effective
way
to
address
these
problems
is
to
reorganize
immigration
courts
under
article
i
of
the
constitution
to
give
them
independence
from
justice
or
any
other
agency
article
i
judges
are
not
subject
to
article
iii
protections
such
as
lifetime
tenure
and
against
salary
reduction
but
they
are
independent
judges
the
united
states
tax
court
the
bankruptcy
courts
and
the
us
court
of
federal
claims
are
all
article
i
courts
it
was
the
recommendation
of
the
1981
select
commission
on
immigration
reform
to
reorganize
immigration
courts
under
article
i
it
was
formulated
into
legislation
hr
185
which
i
introduced
in
the
us
house
in
1999
the
nature
and
volume
of
immigration
cases
dictate
that
there
be
a
trial
division
and
an
appellate
division
under
article
i
the
appellate
division
would
do
what
the
current
administrative
appellate
board
does
and
perhaps
more
if
congress
desires
all
judges
would
be
appointed
by
the
president
subject
to
senate
confirmation
or
alternatively
only
the
appellate
division
judges
would
be
presidential
appointees
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
appellate
division
appointing
trial
judges
tenure
should
be
for
a
certain
number
of
years
perhaps
15
among
proponents
of
an
article
i
court
there
are
differing
views
over
which
higher
courts
should
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
review
of
decisions
of
article
i
immigration
courts
and
with
which
restrictions
limiting
review
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
by
writ
of
certiorari
or
by
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
be
the
most
efficient
and
take
into
account
the
benefit
of
only
that
court
having
to
tackle
complex
immigration
matters
details
such
as
appellate
review
can
be
debated
and
resolved
by
congress
the
important
thing
is
that
the
creation
of
an
article
i
immigration
court
should
be
included
in
any
immigrationreform
legislation
passed
by
congress
only
then
will
we
see
our
immigration
laws
effectively
and
fairly
administered
and
adjudicated
