the
organized
jewish
community
is
known
for
its
impressive
bipartisan
clout
when
advocating
issues
relating
to
israel
but
when
it
comes
to
domestic
affairs
the
community
suffers
from
a
lopsided
lack
of
leverage
on
the
republican
side
some
jewish
activists
believe
that
they
may
have
found
a
pathway
to
the
gop
side
of
the
aisle
their
tactic
play
the
jewish
card
on
the
sole
jewish
republican
in
congress
house
majority
leader
eric
cantor
in
a
communal
event
held
in
cantors
hometown
of
richmond
va
on
february
16
a
group
of
pro
immigration
jewish
activists
including
past
donors
to
cantors
campaigns
tried
to
send
the
no
2
republican
in
the
house
a
message
that
immigration
reform
shelved
by
his
own
party
is
a
jewish
issue
he
ought
to
be
taking
on
it
was
a
strategic
choice
said
abby
levine
director
of
the
jewish
social
justice
roundtable
which
organized
the
event
we
strategically
chose
richmond
because
of
the
importance
of
eric
cantor
cantor
could
be
a
key
person
for
immigration
reform
house
speaker
john
boehner
made
clear
that
the
issue
is
off
the
table
for
this
legislative
year
and
cantor
who
has
avoided
expressing
his
views
on
the
details
of
the
senate
bipartisan
immigration
bill
is
viewed
by
some
including
those
of
the
jewish
community
that
largely
supports
reform
as
the
only
senior
republican
open
to
change
on
the
issue
but
past
experience
has
shown
that
cantor
despite
his
close
ties
with
jewish
leadership
has
not
been
receptive
to
the
communitys
domestic
agenda
gathered
at
the
richmond
jewish
community
center
on
a
snowy
sunday
afternoon
some
70
members
of
the
citys
jewish
community
listened
to
immigration
stories
that
recalled
to
the
audience
the
role
immigration
played
in
american
jewish
history
the
presentation
stressed
immigration
reform
as
an
issue
in
line
with
core
jewish
values

a
menorah

spoke
of
his
family
immigration
from
lithuania
after
the
holocaust
and
of
the
tragedy
of
closing
immigration
gates
during
the
war
janet

jewish
immigrants
to

joining
them
was
felipe

a
nonjewish

of
richmond
marroquin
burst
into
tears
while
sharing
with
the
audience
the
story
of
his
wife
of
20
years
who
was
deported
to
guatemala
while
not
discussing
the
issue
directly
at
the
event
organizers
have
highlighted
in
their
publications
another
richmond
jewish
immigration
story
that
of
the
family
of
the
citys
most
politically
powerful
son
cantor
his
grandparents
fled
antisemitism
in
russia
to
arrive
in
america
and
start
a
new
life
in
virginias
capital
i
am
the
grandson
of
immigrants
and
as
such
my
life
has
been
blessed
with
both
the
strong
religious
faith
and
hardworking
entrepreneurial
ethic
that
so
many
immigrants
bring
to
america
cantor
wrote
in
the
2010
book
young
guns
a
new
generation
of
conservative
leaders
which
he
cowrote
with
fellow
republican
reps
paul
ryan
and
kevin
mccarthy
organizers
said
cantor
was
invited
to
attend
the
event
but
did
not
respond
as
the
discussion
drew
to
a
close
participants
were
offered
a
letter
to
sign
it
was
to
be
sent
to
cantor
urging
him
to
meet
with
his
local
jewish
constituents
to
discuss
immigration
the
immigration
stories
presented
at
the
event
have
inspired
us
to
consider
the
richmond
jewish
communitys
unique
connection
to
the
issue
of
immigration
the
letter
said
the
36
participants
joining
the
letter
asked
their
congressman
to
meet
with
a
group
of
richmond
jewish
leaders
to
discuss
how
the
issue
affects
our
community
and
how
we
can
support
you
to
fix
the
broken
immigration
system
the
request
comes
after
previous
attempts
by
jewish
immigration
activists
to
meet
with
cantor
were
turned
down
gary
creditor
who
is
the
rabbi
of
richmonds
temple
bethel
and
is
a
member
of
the
grassroots
group
virginia
organizing
has
been
unsuccessful
in
his
requests
to
meet
personally
with
cantor
and
discuss
immigration
reform
creditor
vowed
to
keep
on
trying
to
convey
the
message
to
the
house
majority
leader
explaining
that
sometimes
its
like
water
on
a
rock
and
you
have
to
continue
working
and
working
at
it
all
the
time
cantors
office
did
not
respond
to
requests
from
the
forward
to
comment
on
the
event
or
on
cantors
refusal
to
meet
with
members
of
the
jewish
community
in
his
constituency
to
discuss
immigration
reform
the
drive
for
reforming
americas
broken
immigration
system
and
for
dealing
with
the
estimated
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
gathered
momentum
late
last
year
as
prominent
senators
from
both
parties
agreed
on
a
set
of
reform
principles
republicans
controlling
the
house
of
representatives
also
seemed
to
express
willingness
to
take
on
the
issue
but
bitter
disputes
over
including
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
immigrants
and
pushback
from
more
conservative
gop
circles
led
the
house
leadership
to
announce
that
it
would
not
advance
immigration
legislation
this
year
cantor
recently
suggested
that
instead
of
taking
on
a
major
overhaul
of
the
immigration
system
both
parties
should
try
and
make
progress
on
the
smaller
issues
they
can
agree
on
such
as
legalizing
the
status
of
children
of
undocumented
immigrants
who
study
in
college
or
serve
in
the
military
richmonds
jewish
community
with
12000
members
and
six
synagogues
is
considered
small
in
size
but
some
of
the
activists
who
showed
up
to
the
immigration
event
carry
weight
on
the
local
political
scene
ipson
has
contributed
to
cantors
congressional
campaigns
as
has
mark
sisisky
who
moderated
the
meeting
both
also
gave
to
democratic
candidates
in
the
state
sisisky
whose
father
was
a
democratic
member
of
congressfrom
the
district
now
representedby
cantor
said
he
believed
that
the
jewish
story
of
immigrationis
a
story
eric
should
take
intoaccount
when
he
leads
the
party
but
keeping
in
the
spirit
ofsouthern
hospitality
sisisky
alsomade
clear
that
we
didnt
comethere
to
slam
eric
cantors
relationship
with
the
organized
jewish
community
hasbeen
a
mixed
bag
a
staunch
supporter
of
israel
cantor
is
countedas
a
safe
vote
on
legislation
relatingto
israel
and
is
seen
as
an
ally
of
theproisrael
lobby
yet
on
the
domestic
front
where
the
jewish
community
trends
liberal
and
wherecantor
holds
conservative
views
especially
on
fiscal
matters
cooperation
has
been
rare
levine

her
hope
that
theimmigration

moreresonance

what
