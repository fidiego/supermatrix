ordinances
enacted
nearly
four
years
ago
in
hazleton
put
the
city
at
the
forefront
of
an
ongoing
power
struggle
between
local
and
federal
government
for
enforcing
immigration
policy
and
at
the
center
of
an
immigration
forum
hosted
at
penn
state
hazleton
on
thursday
night
dr
grace
delgado
an
assistant
professor
of
history
at
penn
state
university
park
spent
over
an
hour
with
about
50
people
who
packed
into
the
kostos
building
to
hear
her
presentation
titled
the
constitution
and
illegal
immigration
from
the
rise
of
federal
power
to
the
benefit
or
burden
debate
the
presentation
was
intended
to
draw
attention
to
the
debate
on
illegal
immigration
and
to
provide
attendees
with
a
historical
context
of
contemporary
immigration
debate
and
a
tension
that
has
historically
existed
over
federal
and
state
control
over
immigration
her
powerpoint
presentation
focused
on
hazletons
illegal
immigration
relief
act
which
was
ruled
unconstitutional
by
the
3rd
circuit
court
of
appeals
earlier
this
month
an
arizona
law
that
gives
authorities
the
ability
to
inquire
about
peoples
legal
status
and
a
virginia
law
that
targets
anchor
babies
or
children
born
in
the
united
states
to
illegal
immigrants
hazleton
is
actually
a
symbol
of
the
immigration
debate
and
how
local
politicians
and
some
residents
want
to
take
control
of
the
issue
delgado
said
it
is
a
very
significant
national
town
maybe
you
rarely
hear
the
two
descriptions
but
indeed
it
is
she
touched
on
a
recent
federal
court
decision
that
upholds
a
lower
court
ruling
that
deems
hazletons
iira
ordinance
unconstitutional
and
provisions
of
the
ordinance
that
would
punish
people
from
employing
or
renting
to
illegal
immigrants
hazleton
mayor
lou
barletta
vowed
to
appeal
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
if
needed
delgados
presentation
touched
on
debates
made
by
both
supporters
and
proponents
of
the
hazleton
ordinance
saying
many
of
the
arguments
for
and
against
that
ordinance
pertain
to
the
economy
and
jobs
and
whether
illegal
immigrants
drain
health
care
and
social
service
systems
she
believes
people
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
should
look
at
immigration
from
a
human
standpoint
people
do
not
see
it
in
human
terms
she
said
i
think
we
really
need
to
start
look
at
it
from
these
terms
barletta
who
was
not
in
attendance
at
the
lecture
said
late
thursday
that
local
governments
took
up
the
immigration
fight
because
the
federal
government
fails
to
enforce
laws
its
not
that
the
city
is
against
immigration
we
want
to
encourage
legal
immigration
barletta
said
the
bottom
line
really
is
that
if
the
federal
government
enforced
the
immigration
laws
that
are
already
on
the
books
you
would
not
see
the
frustration
among
cities
and
states
across
america
since
hazleton
proposed
its
ordinance
more
than
40
cities
and
states
have
either
proposed
or
discussed
implementing
similar
laws
barletta
said
attorneys
for
the
city
continue
reviewing
the
3rd
circuit
court
ruling
and
have
yet
to
determine
when
they
will
file
an
appeal
the
mayor
said
legal
counsel
is
sorting
through
the
decision
from
the
appeals
court
he
said
then
well
make
a
decision
