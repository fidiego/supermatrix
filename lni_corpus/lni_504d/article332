washington
in
the
annals
of
washington
policy
debates
few
have
been
as
emotional
and
seemingly
insoluble
as
those
involving
immigration
should
the
governments
immigration
agencies
focus
on
law
enforcement
policing
the
borders
to
block
the
entry
of
illegal
immigrants
or
on
services
to
welcome
hardworking
new
immigrants
to
american
shores
should
the
governments
priority
be
keeping
the
bad
guys
out
or
helping
the
good
guys
in
to
a
degree
that
has
startled
immigrantrights
groups
and
the
many
industries
that
depend
on
immigrant
labor
and
with
surprisingly
little
serious
debate
on
capitol
hill
or
anywhere
else
that
argument
was
settled
for
the
time
being
with
congresss
approval
last
month
of
the
landmark
bill
creating
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
law
appears
to
represent
a
decisive
victory
for
advocates
of
tighter
borders
and
immigration
lawyers
are
predicting
turmoil
next
year
as
millions
of
wouldbe
citizens
and
other
immigrants
already
confronted
with
tough
new
immigration
rules
imposed
after
the
sept
11
attacks
try
to
make
sense
of
the
mammoth
new
agency
that
will
control
their
fates
i
think
theres
going
to
be
total
confusion
said
judy
golub
senior
director
of
advocacy
for
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
our
members
are
getting
a
lot
of
calls
from
immigrants
who
feel
that
they
are
the
ones
being
isolated
not
the
terrorists
the
homeland
security
bill
passed
in
the
house
and
senate
by
huge
bipartisan
majorities
and
quickly
signed
by
president
bush
mandates
the
biggest
government
overhaul
in
half
a
century
merging
22
federal
agencies
into
the
new
department
all
tasked
with
preventing
new
terrorist
attacks
on
american
soil
few
of
the
agencies
being
moved
into
the
new
department
face
a
bigger
overhaul
than
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
which
has
been
part
of
the
justice
department
under
the
reorganization
the
nearly
30000
employees
of
ins
long
seen
as
one
of
the
most
dysfunctional
and
demoralized
bureaucracies
in
washington
will
be
divided
into
two
new
agencies
with
lawenforcement
programs
separated
from
immigration
services
like
the
processing
of
green
cards
and
citizenship
applications
aides
to
tom
ridge
the
white
house
domesticsecurity
adviser
who
has
been
nominated
by
president
bush
to
run
the
new
department
said
their
goal
is
to
do
both
jobs
better
yes
enforcement
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
this
department
said
gordon
johndroe
mr
ridges
spokesman
but
this
is
a
welcoming
country
that
was
created
by
immigrants
and
we
are
going
to
do
as
much
as
we
possibly
can
to
make
services
more
efficient
and
helpful
to
the
immigrant
community
advocates
on
both
sides
of
the
immigration
debate
say
they
are
still
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
massive
homelandsecurity
legislation
its
475
pages
are
written
in
such
dense
legalese
that
courts
will
likely
be
deciphering
it
for
decades
but
they
agree
that
lawenforcement
programs
especially
those
designed
to
block
potential
terrorists
from
entering
the
united
states
will
take
precedence
they
also
note
that
the
new
departments
enforcement
arm
will
have
a
much
stronger
advocate
at
senior
levels
of
the
administration
given
the
finite
federal
resources
and
the
new
priorities
advocates
worry
that
immigrant
rights
and
services
are
at
risk
enforcement
seems
to
have
won
the
debate
said
mark
s
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
washingtonbased
group
that
backs
tighter
immigration
laws
where
theres
a
choice
the
government
is
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
enforcement
lawenforcement
programs
including
border
control
will
be
moved
into
the
newly
created
bureau
of
border
security
which
will
be
overseen
by
asa
hutchinson
a
former
republican
congressman
from
arkansas
who
now
runs
the
drug
enforcement
administration
and
is
a
white
house
favorite
immigration
services
which
include
the
processing
of
new
citizens
and
of
people
claiming
asylum
will
be
moved
to
the
bureau
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
the
chief
of
that
bureau
has
not
yet
been
named
whomever
that
turns
out
to
be
the
citizenship
bureau
will
have
no
clear
equivalent
to
mr
hutchinson
to
wage
its
bureaucratic
and
policy
battles
instead
the
citizenship
bureau
will
report
to
the
deputy
secretary
navy
secretary
gordon
r
england
has
been
nominated
for
the
post
and
mr
england
is
sure
to
have
many
more
pressing
duties
than
worrying
about
the
details
of
immigration
services
the
bush
administration
appeared
to
signal
its
priorities
for
the
new
department
when
the
white
house
last
month
announced
that
a
veteran
federal
prosecutor
michael
j
garcia
would
run
the
ins
in
its
final
months
of
existence
and
that
he
would
shepherd
the
immigration
agency
into
the
new
homeland
security
department
mr
garcia
is
best
known
at
the
justice
department
for
his
work
prosecuting
terrorists
including
the
planners
of
the
1993
world
trade
center
bombing
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
described
mr
garcia
as
someone
who
will
lead
tough
enforcement
of
our
immigration
laws
to
protect
americans
from
terrorism
and
protect
our
homeland
the
naming
of
mr
garcia
is
cited
by
immigrantrights
groups
as
evidence
that
the
administration
intends
to
erode
immigrant
rights
and
to
erect
new
barriers
to
immigration
as
it
steps
up
the
war
on
terrorism
mr
garcias
entire
involvement
in
immigration
issues
was
as
a
prosecutor
said
angela
m
kelley
deputy
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
pro
immigration
group
there
is
now
a
tainting
of
all
people
who
come
to
this
country
as
suspected
terrorists
for
immigrants
the
welcome
mat
is
really
being
ripped
out
from
under
them
