comments
about
an

scott
vowed

bring

rick

backs
arizonas
law
hell
bring
it
to
florida
and
let
our
police
check
if
the
people
they
arrest
are
here
legally
thats
common
sense
his
campaign
said
signed
into
law
by
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
in
2010
that
law
requires
police
who
stop
a
person
to
verify
their
immigration
status
if
they
reasonably
suspect
the
person
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
the
us
supreme
court
struck
down
part
of
the
law
in
2012
the
law
became
a
focal
point
of
a
hotly
contested
republican
primary
between
scott
and
then
attorney
general
bill
mccollum
as
they
battled
for
conservative
voters
in
may
2010
mccollum
announced
he
would
support
an
arizonastyle
law
though
scott
strongly
supported
the
measure
as
a
candidate
he
abandoned
it
once
he
became
governor
politifact
florida
rated
the
campaign
pledge
a
promise
broken
on
our
scottometer
a
database
of
his
campaign
promises
back
during
the
2010
campaign
the
miami
herald
interviewed
hispanic
legislators
including
lópezcantera
about
mccollums
support
for
the
arizona
law
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
dont
think
florida
has
a
problem
like
arizona
does
lópezcantera
said
i
realize
theres
a
problem
in
arizona
they
have
a
serious
problem
but
i
dont
think
you
can
compare
it
to
florida
in
august
2010
lópezcantera
told
the
tampa
bay
times
i
am
concerned
that
this
could
jeopardize
civil
liberties
the
topic
of
immigration
reform
remained
a
concern
for
lópezcantera
after
scott
won
the
primary
and
it
appeared
the
two
had
a
conversation
about
it
i
asked
about
the
issue
going
forward
and
he
scott
said
immigration
is
an
issue
but
the
more
pressing
one
is
jobs
and
the
economy
lópezcantera
told
the
miami
herald
in
september
2010
immigration
bills
during
2011
session
lópezcantera
served
as
the
state
house
majority
leader
and
would
have
to
deal
with
a
range
of
republican
viewpoints
on
immigration
reform
both
hardliners
who
wanted
a
crackdown
and
some
hispanic
lawmakers
and
constituents
who
viewed
such
a
push
as
antihispanic
during
the
2011
session
legislators
introduced
the
florida
immigration
enforcement
act
as
hb
7089
and
a
similar
bill
in
the
senate
sb
2040
the
bills
were
not
identical
to
arizonas
law
but
for
immigrant
advocates
it
raised
fears
that
it
would
increase
racial
profiling
some
businessbacked
groups
also
raised
concerns
because
there
was
a
component
that
related
to
employers
the
house
bill
would
have
required
police
to
check
the
immigration
status
of
a
person
subject
of
a
criminal
investigation
if
the
police
had
reasonable
suspicion
the
person
was
in
the
country
illegally
also
employers
would
be
required
to
check
workers
immigration
status
the
senate
counterpart
didnt
go
as
far
and
only
let
police
police
check
the
status
of
an
inmate
not
a
person
only
under
investigation
and
it
gave
some
wiggle
room
to
employers
in
march
2011
the
house
judiciary
committee
passed
the
bill
126
lópezcantera
miamidades
delegation
chair
wasnt
a
member
of
that
committee
but
in
his
press
release
after
the
vote
he
spoke
positively
about
the
law
but
didnt
specifically
state
how
he
would
vote
on
it
chairman
snyder
and
the
judiciary
committee
recognize
the
unique
and
diverse
history
of
our
state
and
have
worked
hard
to
bring
all
stakeholders
to
the
table
to
produce
this
piece
of
common
sense
florida
immigration
reform
this
legislation
is
designed
to
preserve
employment
opportunities
for
floridians
through
the
use
of
the
everify
system
the
bill
does
not
require
law
enforcement
officers
to
ask
individuals
for
immigration
documentation
during
routine
traffic
stops
it
does
however
give
law
enforcement
officers
the
tools
necessary
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
of
the
united
states
i
look
forward
to
watching
this
reasonable
and
effective
approach
to
immigration
reform
work
its
way
through
the
legislative
process
activists
opposing
the
bills
turned
up
the
heat
and
particularly
targeted
lópezcantera
and
sen
anitere
flores
a
sponsor
of
the
senate
bill
and
another
hispanic
republican
from
miamidade
in
april
leftleaning
and
hispanic
groups
announced
they
would
launch
spanishlanguage
radio
ads
calling
out
the
two
legislators
groups
also
held
a
protest
in
front
of
lópezcanteras
office
while
the
attacks
were
going
on
the
herald
reported
that
lópezcantera
was
now
against
the
house
measure
and
planned
to
vote
against
it
as
well
florida
doesnt
need
an
immigration
law
he
said
in
april
2011
the
senate
passed
a
version
of
the
bill
but
the
full
house
never
took
a
vote
the
measure
was
dead
by
the
end
of
the
session
we
asked
for
evidence
from
the
miamidade
group
that
made
the
claim
but
didnt
hear
back
however
joshua
karp
spokesman
for
the
florida
democratic
party
said
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
lópezcantera
supported
the
bill
but
later
flipflopped
we
were
unsuccessful
at
getting
a
direct
response
from
lópezcantera
a
spokesman
for
the
republican
party
of
florida
sent
us
a
statement
arguing
that
floridas
proposed
bill
was
different
from
the
arizona
law
and
repeated
this
line
from
lópezcanteras
press
release
the
bill
does
not
require
law
enforcement
officers
to
ask
individuals
for
immigration
documentation
during
routine
traffic
stops
our
ruling
the
democratic
hispanic
caucus
of
floridas
miamidade
chapter
that
stated
lópezcantera
staunchly
supported
a
bill
modeled
after
arizonas
immigration
law
lópezcantera
never
had
to
take
a
vote
on
the
bill
so
the
only
evidence
we
can
evaluate
is
his
statements
about
the
bill
at
first
lópezcantera
said
he
looked
forward
to
watching
this
reasonable
and
effective
approach
to
immigration
reform
work
its
way
through
the
legislative
process
thats
a
positive
statement
but
hardly
staunch
support
but
as
protesters
turned
up
the
heat
on
lópezcantera
he
became
decidedly
opposed
saying
florida
doesnt
need
an
immigration
law
we
rate
this
claim
mostly
false

this
statement
