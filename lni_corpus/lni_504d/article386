a
year
after
californians
stoked
a
whitehot
national
immigration
debate
by
ratifying
proposition
187
a
key
congressional
panel
is
expected
this
week
to
approve
one
of
the
most
restrictive
us
immigration
bills
since
1924
the
house
judiciary
committees
measure
mirrored
in
key
places
by
a
slowermoving
senate
bill
would
cut
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
from
the
800000
who
came
to
the
united
states
last
year
to
595000
by
2001
while
its
complexion
is
certain
to
change
as
it
winds
its
way
through
congress
and
lands
on
president
clintons
desk
probably
sometime
next
year
this
much
is
clear
america
is
poised
to
yank
in
its
welcome
mat
for
illegal
and
legal
immigrants
alike
even
before
congress
acts
the
debate
over
the
bill
will
serve
as
a
national
forum
for
the
more
fundamental
question
of
whether
immigration
helps
or
hurts
the
nation
if
illegal
immigration
has
reached
a
crisis
our
legal
immigration
system
has
reached
the
point
where
it
no
longer
serves
the
national
interest
said
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
chief
house
sponsor
of
the
immigration
reform
bill
immigration
to
the
united
states
which
peaked
at
12
million
in
1907
has
ebbed
and
flowed
over
the
decades
the
bill
before
the
house
panel
would
allow
for
roughly
the
level
of
immigration
that
occurred
during
the
1920s
during
the
acknowledged
immigration
boom
but
the
us
population
has
nearly
tripled
since
that
time
polls
show
voters
have
a
strong
appetite
for
deep
immigration
cuts
tightening
the
borders
the
house
panel
which
hopes
to
complete
its
work
on
the
bill
within
days
already
has
spent
weeks
on
a
measure
that
would
dramatically
rewrite
rules
for
those
who
seek
to
come
here
legally
and
launch
aggressive
new
strategies
to
thwart
those
who
unlawfully
cross
us
borders
as
a
practical
matter
we
really
dont
need
immigration
anymore
said
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
after
all
this
isnt
1810
were
not
trying
to
fill
up
a
wilderness
while
lawmakers
are
unlikely
to
satisfy
conservative
groups
like
fair
which
wants
an
immigration
moratorium
they
are
charting
a
course
on
immigration
that
was
unthinkable
before
california
overwhelmingly
approved
prop
187
which
denies
most
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
and
is
now
under
attack
in
the
courts
the
house
bill
is
nothing
short
of
a
watershed
in
the
manner
in
which
america
controls
its
borders
consider
it
would
establish
a
telephone
system
for
employers
to
verify
the
work
eligibility
for
all
job
applicants
a
pilot
program
in
at
least
five
states
including
california
would
be
completed
by
1999
after
that
congress
could
expand
the
system
nationwide
a
move
critics
decry
as
the
first
step
toward
a
national
identification
card
it
calls
for
the
construction
of
three
parallel
fences
for
14
miles
along
the
us
border
in
san
diego
county
the
clinton
administration
has
said
that
plan
labeled
nutso
by
democrats
would
cost
as
much
as
110
million
it
would
cap
the
number
of
immigrants
sponsored
by
their
us
relatives
to
330000
a
year
there
would
be
no
limits
for
spouses
and
minor
children
of
us
citizens
in
1994
about
462000
immigrants
including
adult
children
and
brothers
and
sisters
of
us
citizens
came
to
the
united
states
under
the
sponsorship
of
their
relatives
here
that
change
is
likely
to
hurt
asians
who
make
up
a
disproportionately
large
share
of
adult
siblings
seeking
us
residency
of
the
16
million
now
seeking
entry
to
the
us
under
that
category
more
than
1
million
are
asians
it
would
tighten
the
rules
by
which
foreigners
gain
political
asylum
and
establish
a
ceiling
of
50000
on
the
number
of
refugees
admitted
yearly
to
the
united
states
thats
a
cut
of
about
50
percent
the
bill
also
would
prohibit
the
entry
of
foreigners
with
no
job
skills
and
no
family
ties
hasten
the
deportation
of
undocumented
aliens
deny
public
benefits
to
illegal
immigrants
and
double
the
nations
border
patrol
force
by
adding
1000
agents
each
year
for
five
years
this
bill
goes
so
far
beyond
what
is
reasonable
that
it
jeopardizes
the
whole
premise
of
our
immigration
system
said
cecilia
munoz
a
deputy
vice
president
at
the
national
council
of
la
raza
which
is
fighting
many
components
of
the
house
bill
it
has
several
absolutely
incredible
and
sweeping
provisions
that
dont
serve
anyone
unusual
alliances
this
years
immigration
debate
also
has
forged
odd
political
alliances
some
conservative
republicans
have
joined
liberal
democrats
in
condemning
the
telephone
verification
system
house
majority
leader
richard
armey
rtexas
and
us
sen
edward
kennedy
dmass
are
balking
at
stringent
antiimmigration
measures
the
libertarian
cato
institute
has
attacked
the
bill
as
a
disaster
and
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
dubbed
it
antibusiness
but
earlier
this
year
the
bill
gained
unusual
momentum
after
a
national
commission
headed
by
former
rep
barbara
jordan
dtexas
called
for
cuts
in
legal
immigration
a
plan
swiftly
and
surprisingly
embraced
by
president
clinton
since
then
clintons
immigration
commissioner
doris
meissner
has
said
congress
ought
to
concentrate
this
year
on
measures
to
curb
illegal
immigration
but
reform
advocates
like
smith
the
texas
congressman
are
using
popular
measures
to
trim
unlawful
immigration
as
a
lever
to
boost
lesspalatable
proposals
to
curb
legal
immigration
attempt
to
split
bill
a
democratic
proposal
last
week
to
separate
the
two
issues
into
two
distinct
bills
was
easily
defeated
you
have
a
terrible
problem
in
moving
this
bill
in
the
form
its
in
now
rep
howard
berman
dmission
hills
sponsor
of
the
failed
attempt
to
split
the
bill
told
gop
lawmakers
your
own
party
is
deeply
divided
in
its
views
on
cutting
back
legal
immigration
you
have
a
controversial
verification
system
you
cannot
carry
all
these
burdens
while
many
immigration
advocates
say
they
do
not
expect
some
of
the
more
extreme
ingredients
of
the
house
bill
to
survive
scrutiny
before
the
full
house
they
concede
the
question
is
no
longer
whether
congress
acts
to
cut
immigration
but
how
far
it
will
go
it
looks
like
theres
a
lot
of
momentum
for
these
cuts
said
frank
sharry
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
forum
a
proimmigration
group
its
almost
like
republicans
aimed
at
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
and
shot
legal
immigration
instead
