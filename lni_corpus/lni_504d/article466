the

says
she
fled
the
democratic

to
escape
torture
now
faces
deportation
back

alert
immigration
officials
a
young
ethiopian
woman
is
deported
to
her
native
country
after
her
appeal
for
asylum
languished
for
nearly
a
decade
in
the
federal
bureaucracy
and
her
marriage
to
a
us
resident
wasnt
vetted
by
immigration
officials
fast
enough
ever
since
the
terrorist
attacks
of
sept
11
2001
the
nations
immigration
system
has
stepped
up
its
scrutiny
of
immigrants
and
its
enforcement
of
deportation
laws
some
who
get
deported
have
committed
heinous
crimes
and
elicit
little
sympathy
from
the
public
but
others
such
as
the
women
mentioned
above
have
received
public
outpourings
of
concern
and
support
is
there
logic
behind
who
gets
kicked
out
experts
say
yes
theoretically
there
is
but
it
is
coupled
with
less
willingness
by
immigration
officials
to
exercise
discretion
out
of
fear
theyll
let
in
or
let
go
the
next
terrorist
add
to
that
the
legendary
inefficiency
of
the
immigration
system
then
include
a
growing
number
of
leads
and
tips
about
potential
immigration
violators
all
in
all
the
system
is
catching
a
lot
of
people
including
many
who
pose
little
if
any
security
risk
the
2001
attacks
led
to
a
reorganization
of
how
the
federal
government
dealt
with
immigration
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
was
replaced
with
multiple
agencies
under
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
primary
agency
charged
with
handling
deportations
is
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
spokesmen
for
the
agency
insist
it
does
not
pursue
people
randomly
but
rather
targets
first
the
bad
guys
suspected
terrorists
convicted
criminals
especially
sex
predators
and
smugglers
the
agency
also
targets
absconders
people
who
are
under
a
court
order
to
leave
the
country
but
havent
many
such
absconders
entered
the
country
legally
through
visas
and
other
means
from
a
priority
basis
yes
we
are
prioritizing
our
goals
our
missions
much
more
to
rid
this
country
of
the
most
dangerous
people
said
carl
rusnok
an
immigration
and
customs
spokesman
what
makes
the
system
less
predictable
are
the
many
leads
through
law
enforcement
agencies
or
civilians
that
agents
receive
about
the
illegal
immigrants
who
otherwise
may
not
have
been
targets
immigration
officials
said
the
agents
simply
follow
up
the
tighter
enforcement
shows
in
the
numbers
from
october
2003
through
september
2004
immigration
and
customs
removed
a
record
number
of
criminal
and
other
illegal
immigrants
from
the
united
states
the
total
was
161346
removed
including
85165
who
were
considered
criminals
but
the
numbers
mask
many
complex
often
sympathetic
cases
immigration
law
is
different
from
criminal
law
and
often
what
counts
as
a
misdemeanor
in
the
us
criminal
justice
system
may
count
as
a
deportable
aggravated
felony
for
purposes
of
immigration
consensual
sex
with
a
minor
often
is
prosecuted
as
a
misdemeanor
under
the
criminal
system
but
it
could
lead
to
deportation
under
immigration
the
1996
reforms
to
immigration
laws
also
made
retroactive
some
of
its
provisions
so
permanent
residents
who
had
already
been
convicted
of
certain
crimes
years
before
still
face
deportation
its
real
slippery
said
erich
straub
a
milwaukee
immigration
attorney
theres
a
lot
of
people
put
into
these
categories
that
if
the
general
public
knew
what
they
had
really
done
they
wouldnt
feel
like
deportation
was
necessarily
the
just
result
many
who
favor
stricter
immigration
laws
say
the
government
is
not
being
tough
enough
especially
when
it
comes
to
finding
people
who
entered
the
country
illegally
and
remain
undocumented
its
a
reasonable
list
of
priorities
except
for
the
fact
that
it
completely
ignores
illegal
alien
workers
said
jack
martin
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
when
the
interior
enforcement
people
have
tried
to
crack
down
on
illegal
alien
workers
they
have
systematically
run
into
political
repercussions
from
politicians
representing
businesses
critics
of
the
immigration
and
customs
agency
meanwhile
say
the
nations
immigration
databases
are
outdated
backlogged
and
riddled
with
errors
immigrants
who
send
in
change
of
address
forms
may
never
know
they
received
orders
to
appear
in
court
because
immigration
officials
hadnt
updated
their
system
and
sent
the
orders
to
the
persons
former
address
the
sheer
complexity
of
immigration
law
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
people
it
affects
most
are
foreigners
who
often
face
language
barriers
doesnt
help
neither
does
the
length
of
time
it
takes
for
the
system
to
work
cases
can
last
years
abesha
bobbie
zenebes
appeal
for
asylum
lingered
for
almost
a
decade
in
the
immigration
system
by
the
time
it
was
denied
she
had
married
an
american
and
was
trying
to
obtain
legal
residency
through
him
but
immigration
authorities
didnt
review
her
marriage
to
the
okauchee
wis
contractor
fast
enough
after
months
in
detention
and
15
years
in
the
united
states
zenebe
was
sent
back
to
ethiopia
in
late
2003
as
far
as
the
system
goes
there
is
no
sense
that
theyre
more
efficient
now
said
christina
deconcini
director
of
policy
at
the
national
immigration
forum
an
immigrant
rights
group
it
continues
to
be
a
problem
a
recent
case
is
that
of
regina
bakala
whose
family
said
she
came
to
the
united
states
in
1995
using
false
papers
to
flee
the
torture
in
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
judges
ruled
against
her
request
for
asylum
but
bakala
didnt
know
this
because
her
lawyer
had
moved
and
never
learned
of
the
verdict
the
legal
nightmare
worsened
when
she
learned
about
the
result
last
year
after
she
and
her
husband
tried
to
get
financing
for
a
house
federal
agents
appeared
at
bakalas
milwaukee
doorstep
a
few
weeks
ago
and
detained
her
her
supporters
are
seeking
legal
relief
but
she
faces
deportation
any
day
the
volume
of
leads
immigration
officials
receive
appears
to
be
growing
largely
due
to
government
efforts
in
july
2003
the
immigration
and
customs
law
enforcement
support
center
set
up
a
tip
line
to
gather
information
on
potential
violators
from
oct
1
to
march
30
the
line
received
more
than
41500
calls
thats
more
than
the
27671
received
all
of
the
previous
year
were
often
quite
amazed
at
the
incredible
detail
with
which
some
people
report
tips
said
mike
gilhooly
a
spokesman
for
the
center
one
controversial
move
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
been
uploading
certain
categories
of
immigration
status
data
into
the
fbis
national
crime
information
center
database
police
officers
across
the
country
routinely
check
the
database
for
information
about
people
they
encounter
if
they
run
across
someone
immigration
and
customs
wants
detained
they
take
the
person
into
custody
thats
how
brown
deer
wis
police
who
came
upon
terwinder
singhs
flat
tire
played
a
role
in
her
deportation
last
year
the
department
confirmed
singh
who
was
living
in
sussex
wis
had
entered
the
country
12
years
before
using
false
papers
to
come
for
an
arranged
marriage
she
lost
her
legal
appeals
to
stay
but
her
husband
says
never
received
word
of
her
final
deportation
order
singh
is
now
back
in
india
along
with
her
two
children
who
were
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states
many
police
officials
worry
that
taking
on
the
role
of
immigration
enforcement
will
damage
community
policing
efforts
and
even
encourage
those
fearing
deportation
including
witnesses
to
leave
the
scenes
of
traffic
accidents
and
crimes
some
civil
rights
organizations
have
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
practice
of
entering
the
immigration
data
into
national
crime
information
center
saying
it
encourages
racial
profiling
among
other
things
but
others
say
enlisting
police
to
find
immigration
law
violators
is
a
sensible
step
increasing
the
manpower
available
to
rid
the
country
of
lawbreakers
civilians
meanwhile
have
entered
immigration
enforcement
in
rather
unusual
ways
perhaps
the
most
publicized
have
been
the
socalled
minutemen
who
have
volunteered
along
the
countrys
southern
border
to
ward
off
those
who
try
to
cross
into
the
united
states
illegally
also
others
can
now
turn
to
civilianrun
web
sites
such
as
reportillegalscom
which
sometimes
for
a
fee
will
take
their
tips
about
potential
illegal
immigrants
and
forward
them
to
federal
officials
by
many
measures
the
longstanding
debate
over
immigration
policy
appears
to
be
growing
more
heated
with
some
leading
figures
expecting
major
reforms
in
the
coming
five
years
whats
unclear
is
exactly
what
those
reforms
will
be
in
2004
president
bush
rolled
out
a
proposal
that
allows
immigrants
to
stay
in
the
united
states
as
guest
workers
but
expects
the
workers
to
eventually
return
to
their
home
countries
an
estimated
8
million
to
12
million
illegal
immigrants
live
in
the
united
states
bushs
proposal
faces
criticism
from
multiple
sides
some
worry
it
could
lead
to
amnesty
and
others
say
it
does
not
address
the
fact
that
many
of
the
guest
workers
will
want
to
stay
permanently
on
the
enforcement
end
us
rep
f
james
sensenbrenner
jrs
real
id
bill
is
generating
a
great
deal
of
debate
the
wisconsin
republicans
bill
makes
it
more
difficult
for
illegal
immigrants
to
obtain
drivers
licenses
but
it
also
deals
with
asylum
deportation
and
border
security
matters
the
bills
critics
are
especially
upset
about
the
asylum
provision
saying
it
makes
it
even
harder
for
people
fleeing
persecution
to
prove
that
to
immigration
officials
in
the
united
states
but
sensenbrenner
has
defended
the
proposal
saying
it
is
a
matter
of
security
sensenbrenners
provisions
were
included
in
the
supplemental
spending
bill
for
iraq
which
was
approved
by
the
house
last
month
and
currently
is
in
conference
committee
political
observers
anticipated
its
approval
