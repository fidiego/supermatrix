us
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
united
states
have
been
heartened
by
last
weeks
democratic
election
victory
but
reviving
comprehensive
reform
legislation
could
take
months
and
its
passage
through
the
new
congress
is
not
guaranteed
president
george
bush
last
week
identified
immigration
reform
as
one
of
the
issues
on
which
he
could
cooperate
with
the
democratic
leadership
in
congress
the
presidents
approach
to
immigration
finds
more
support
among
democrats
than
republicans
immigration
reform
is
not
part
of
the
democrats
agenda
for
the
first
100
legislative
hours
however
which
includes
increasing
the
minimum
wage
cutting
interest
rates
on
student
loans
and
implementing
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
that
investigated
the
september
11th
attacks
a
spokesman
for
incoming
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
said
this
week
that
under
a
democratic
process
there
will
be
a
more
deliberative
body
and
members
will
know
what
they
are
voting
on
this
means
that
instead
of
simply
rewriting
immigration
bills
from
the
outgoing
congress
and
moving
them
quickly
to
a
vote
the
democrats
will
start
the
entire
legislative
process
again
with
fresh
hearings
and
lengthy
committee
drafting
sessions
known
as
markups
earlier
this
year
the
senate
approved
a
bill
that
would
improve
border
security
and
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
but
would
introduce
a
temporary
guestworker
programme
most
of
the
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
already
in
the
us
would
have
been
allowed
to
regularise
their
status
and
eventually
apply
for
citizenship
the
house
of
representatives
had
already
passed
a
bill
which
focused
solely
on
enforcement
which
would
have
made
illegal
immigration
a
felony
and
would
criminalise
anyone
who
assisted
an
illegal
alien
instead
of
negotiating
a
compromise
bill
with
the
senate
the
republican
house
leadership
held
a
series
of
field
hearings
around
the
us
an
exercise
many
democrats
viewed
as
little
more
than
electioneering
battling
against
popular
anger
over
the
iraq
war
and
mr
bushs
unpopularity
some
republicans
saw
immigration
as
a
promising
wedge
issue
in
last
weeks
election
and
campaigned
on
a
stridently
antiimmigration
platform
it
was
a
gamble
that
backfired
badly
and
some
of
the
most
prominent
republican
opponents
of
immigration
including
john
hostettler
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
lost
their
seats
in
arizona
which
receives
more
illegal
immigrants
than
california
texas
and
new
mexico
combined
and
has
seen
its
crime
rate
soar
in
recent
years
anti
immigration
candidates
randy
graf
and
jd
hayworth
lost
to
democrats
who
back
a
path
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
arizonas
governor
janet
napolitano
easily
beat
off
a
challenge
from
a
republican
who
put
a
hardline
approach
to
immigration
at
the
centre
of
his
campaign
any
new
legislation
is
likely
to
start
in
the
senate
where
there
is
a
majority
in
favour
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
despite
the
election
of
populist
democrats
such
as
ohios
sherrod
brown
three
dozen
democrats
supported
the
hardline
republican
immigration
bill
in
the
house
of
representatives
last
year
and
some
of
the
new
democratic
congressmen
favour
a
tough
approach
the
aflcio
trade
union
which
helped
to
fund
many
democratic
candidates
has
criticised
the
guestworker
plan
as
a
form
of
indentured
servitude
although
the
union
supports
the
concept
of
a
path
to
citizenship
if
the
democrats
are
serious
about
immigration
reform
they
will
have
to
move
by
the
summer
of
2007
or
the
presidential
election
the
following
year
could
stand
in
the
way
for
campaigners
such
as
the
irish
lobby
for
immigration
reform
which
represents
the
undocumented
irish
in
the
us
the
coming
months
will
be
crucial
