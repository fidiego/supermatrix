the
clinton
administration
yesterday
proposed
spending
an
additional
1
billion
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
at
the
border
and
the
workplace
by
adding
hundreds
more
immigration
agents
expanding
deportations
and
experimenting
with
computerized
identity
checks
for
job
seekers
nearly
half
of
the
new
money
one
of
the
few
spending
initiatives
in
the
new
budget
proposal
is
promised
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ins
which
would
get
a
24
percent
budget
increase
to
26
billion
on
top
of
increases
in
the
past
two
years
this
would
represent
a
71
percent
rise
in
the
agencys
budget
since
1993
the
other
large
chunk
of
money
more
than
onethird
of
the
additional
funding
would
go
to
state
governments
to
help
pay
for
providing
emergency
medical
care
to
illegal
immigrants
incarcerating
those
who
have
committed
crimes
here
and
some
education
programs
the
customs
service
the
labor
department
and
other
agencies
of
the
justice
department
would
get
the
remaining
funds
contending
that
the
administration
is
trying
to
make
up
for
the
neglect
of
its
predecessors
attorney
general
janet
reno
said
at
a
news
conference
three
years
ago
it
was
clear
that
this
administration
had
inherited
a
stepchild
immigration
agency
that
had
suffered
decades
of
neglect
the
proposed
funding
increases
she
said
are
part
of
a
strategy
to
control
the
border
and
bring
the
ins
into
the
20th
century
before
the
21st
century
the
major
challenges
to
the
administrations
plan
are
likely
to
come
from
those
who
demand
more
rather
than
less
spending
this
is
not
a
strategic
policy
plan
to
combat
illegal
immigration
as
much
as
an
effort
at
political
appeasement
and
it
does
not
begin
to
remedy
the
crisis
that
afflicts
california
said
leslie
goodman
spokesman
for
california
gov
pete
wilson
r
who
has
been
president
clintons
chief
antagonist
on
illegal
immigration
rep
lamar
s
smith
rtex
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
subcommittee
on
immigration
said
it
is
a
promising
start
but
it
is
not
enough
we
welcome
the
fact
that
the
president
is
putting
the
money
in
the
right
places
but
we
need
to
do
more
one
area
of
spending
that
smith
said
he
expected
congress
to
expand
involves
proposals
by
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
representative
barbara
jordan
dtex
to
help
employers
identify
illegal
immigrants
who
are
trying
to
get
jobs
less
than
3
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
administrations
new
immigration
initiative
283
million
is
designated
to
fund
pilot
projects
recommended
by
the
jordan
commission
moreover
ins
commissioner
doris
meissner
said
yesterday
that
the
administration
envisioned
spending
three
years
experimenting
with
various
alternatives
before
deciding
whether
to
implement
the
centerpiece
of
the
commissions
recommendations
a
national
computer
registry
of
all
workers
controversy
also
was
developing
around
the
administrations
proposal
to
fund
part
of
the
increased
spending
by
charging
a
fee
for
legal
border
crossing
the
fees
of
150
per
person
and
3
per
vehicle
would
be
used
to
pay
for
improved
immigration
and
customs
facilities
at
the
border
but
the
proposal
instantly
provoked
opposition
from
border
communities
that
rely
economically
on
regular
and
rapid
visits
by
mexicans
and
canadians
with
legislators
from
border
states
almost
unanimous
in
their
opposition
smith
said
the
crossing
fee
is
just
too
controversial
to
pass
congress
and
it
would
be
better
to
just
forget
it
much
of
the
administrations
proposal
builds
on
efforts
launched
last
year
at
the
urging
of
congress
to
fight
illegal
immigration
at
the
border
the
new
budget
plan
would
add
700
border
patrol
agents
to
an
existing
force
of
nearly
5000
about
the
same
increase
as
last
year
envisioning
much
greater
efforts
in
the
future
the
administration
promised
to
bring
total
border
patrol
strength
to
7000
agents
by
the
end
of
the
century
on
another
front
the
administrations
proposal
envisions
adding
365
new
ins
investigators
to
the
personnel
that
enforce
the
law
against
employing
illegal
immigrants
a
73
percent
increase
in
an
area
that
received
diminished
resources
in
recent
years
in
addition
the
department
of
labor
would
get
202
new
employees
to
investigate
violations
of
labor
standards
in
sectors
of
the
economy
that
are
known
to
employ
large
numbers
of
illegal
immigrants
