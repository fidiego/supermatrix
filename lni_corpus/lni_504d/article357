the
voice
of
the
people
has
had
little
impact
on
the
tone
or
direction
of
the
immigration
debate
in
washington
congress
has
not
only
propped
the
door
open
it
has
opened
it
wider
in
recent
years
yet
the
public
has
consistently
favored
restricting
immigration
levels
throughout
this
century
and
especially
in
the
past
20
years
for
example
a
cbs
newsnew
york
times
poll
in
1986
found
52
percent
of
respondents
favored
cutting
immigration
levels
while
just
11
percent
favored
an
increase
the
same
poll
in
1994
found
59
percent
wanting
immigration
cuts
while
a
mere
6
percent
desired
an
increase
in
immigration
levels
more
recent
polls
indicate
the
same
lopsided
margin
favoring
reduced
immigration
yet
congress
has
acted
as
if
the
polling
numbers
are
the
opposite
of
what
they
really
are
why
hasnt
the
public
will
been
translated
into
public
policy
first
the
publics
opinions
on
immigration
are
for
the
most
part
not
deepseated
in
many
areas
of
the
country
people
have
little
contact
with
immigrants
though
these
areas
are
shrinking
the
foreignborn
population
remains
most
heavily
concentrated
on
the
coasts
while
having
contact
with
immigrants
is
not
necessary
to
forming
opinions
about
immigration
policy
the
increased
presence
of
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
in
california
and
other
border
states
clearly
has
helped
to
activate
public
opinion
there
particularly
in
times
of
economic
hardship
when
jobs
are
scarce
second
a
strong
proimmigration
interest
group
lobby
has
arisen
in
the
past
20
years
that
has
fought
very
effectively
for
more
open
entry
and
immigrants
rights
these
groups
have
advanced
their
cause
by
working
in
coalitions
and
by
providing
information
to
the
large
number
of
undecided
members
of
congress
whose
constituencies
fail
to
voice
their
views
on
immigration
matters
one
of
the
most
influential
groups
in
washington
is
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
the
official
organization
of
the
immigration
bar
the
associations
small
membership
of
about
4500
is
influential
because
it
is
wellfunded
and
has
considerable
expertise
on
the
issue
labor
unions
have
now
joined
the
lobby
promoting
less
restrictive
immigration
policy
while
unions
have
long
opposed
largescale
immigration
as
harmful
to
its
members
economic
interests
the
growing
number
of
hispanics
and
asians
employed
in
service
industries
have
become
targets
for
union
organizing
since
the
late
1980s
concerned
about
the
longterm
drop
in
union
membership
labor
leaders
have
turned
to
generous
immigration
policy
as
a
means
for
reenergizing
a
flagging
movement
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue
the
prorestriction
lobby
is
not
nearly
as
welldeveloped
or
as
wellcoordinated
the
leading
restrictionist
organization
fair
found
itself
isolated
in
the
19951996
round
of
immigration
reform
against
a
diverse
and
wellorganized
coalition
of
pro
immigration
groups
which
included
hightech
industries
religious
organizations
union
leaders
and
libertarians
members
of
congress
and
staff
whom
we
interviewed
told
us
that
the
pro
restriction
lobby
has
a
public
relations
problem
that
limits
its
impact
on
many
otherwise
sympathetic
politicians
on
capitol
hill
they
associate
restrictionist
groups
with
radical
environmental
and
controversial
population
control
organizations
most
politicians
consider
these
groups
to
be
on
the
fringe
and
their
views
are
not
taken
as
seriously
no
washingtonbased
group
is
regarded
as
truly
representing
the
views
of
the
mainstream
american
public
the
absence
of
stronger
bettercoordinated
public
action
across
the
country
has
allowed
interest
group
activists
to
leverage
their
influence
on
the
direction
of
immigration
policy
interest
groups
will
continue
to
dominate
the
immigration
debate
until
average
americans
express
their
views
on
immigration
policy
to
their
representatives
in
washington
as
well
as
directly
in
the
voting
