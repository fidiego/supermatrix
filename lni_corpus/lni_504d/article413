the
summer
of
1994
marked
a
turning
point
in
the
history
of
immigration
to
the
united
states
it
may
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
an
era
dating
from
the
1960s
in
which
an
influx
of
latino
and
asian
newcomers
changed
the
face
of
america
regardless
of
what
happens
on
election
day
in
california
where
illegal
immigration
has
polarized
an
entire
campaign
season
the
political
dynamics
of
the
issue
have
changed
irrevocably
cracking
down
on
illegal
immigrants
has
been
embraced
by
politicians
across
the
ideological
spectrum
who
now
debate
only
the
appropriate
means
inexorably
the
status
of
refugees
and
legal
immigrants
have
become
part
of
the
fray
if
1994
is
remembered
as
the
year
when
america
began
to
close
its
doors
then
aug
18
will
be
the
date
to
remember
that
evening
just
in
time
for
the
11
pm
news
on
the
east
coast
attorney
general
janet
reno
announced
that
henceforth
cuban
rafters
would
be
sent
to
an
internment
camp
on
the
us
naval
base
at
guantanamo
bay
cubans
were
once
the
most
privileged
immigrants
like
berlin
wall
jumpers
and
russian
ballet
dancers
they
were
cold
war
icons
for
more
than
30
years
they
served
as
evidence
of
americas
moral
superiority
then
in
the
summer
of
1994
president
clinton
put
cubans
behind
barbed
wire
and
no
one
much
complained
clintons
decision
may
have
been
prompted
by
the
potential
danger
to
the
reelection
campaign
of
florida
gov
lawton
chiles
but
the
groundwork
for
the
decision
was
laid
in
response
to
another
governor
californias
pete
wilson
a
republican
and
a
foe
wilson
put
illegal
immigration
on
the
national
political
agenda
by
making
it
the
key
issue
in
his
reelection
effort
in
an
innovative
formulation
he
denounced
porous
borders
as
an
unfunded
federal
mandate
and
demanded
that
washington
make
up
the
losses
to
his
state
treasury
fearful
of
the
political
fallout
in
a
state
that
is
the
keystone
to
his
own
reelection
prospects
the
president
embraced
wilsons
diagnosis
and
ordered
up
his
own
cure
having
resisted
gop
legislation
to
boost
the
border
patrol
in
1993
clinton
launched
his
own
initiative
as
part
of
the
crime
bill
passed
last
summer
although
the
administration
disputed
the
amount
of
money
illegal
immigration
costs
states
it
embraced
the
logic
of
reimbursement
and
began
writing
checks
to
sacramento
and
other
state
capitals
by
the
time
the
summer
was
over
however
clinton
had
not
only
extended
the
illegal
immigration
crisis
to
the
cubans
but
had
also
broadened
the
fiscal
arguments
against
immigrants
to
cover
those
who
are
here
legally
a
major
financing
provision
of
the
welfare
reform
plan
clinton
unveiled
june
15
involved
further
limiting
legal
immigrants
alreadyrestricted
access
to
the
welfare
system
the
politics
of
restriction
got
another
boost
from
an
unexpected
quarter
when
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
headed
by
former
us
representative
barbara
jordan
of
texas
declared
that
the
illegal
influx
needed
urgent
attention
and
proposed
the
kind
of
aggressive
crackdown
that
had
mostly
been
advocated
by
conservative
republicans
in
the
past
and
had
never
gotten
very
far
in
congress
immigration
advocates
complain
that
jordan
perhaps
unwittingly
provided
white
liberals
african
americans
and
assorted
democrats
all
the
political
cover
they
needed
to
take
up
a
restrictionist
agenda
jordan
and
the
commission
put
forward
what
they
thought
were
carefully
crafted
proposals
and
insisted
that
they
were
not
advocating
a
national
id
card
but
in
the
current
political
atmosphere
theyve
lent
credibility
to
the
idea
that
expensive
and
potentially
intrusive
measures
are
necessary
to
fight
illegal
immigration
said
cecilia
munoz
chief
immigration
analyst
for
the
national
council
of
la
raza
in
the
heat
of
the
current
campaign
politicians
as
ideologically
diverse
as
wilson
and
sen
edward
m
kennedy
dmass
have
said
they
favored
an
identity
card
plan
to
prevent
illegal
immigrants
from
getting
jobs
jordan
meanwhile
has
boldly
staked
her
reputation
as
a
civil
rights
leader
on
a
promise
that
there
would
be
no
harmful
effects
in
terms
of
civil
liberties
and
discrimination
none
of
this
would
have
been
possible
except
for
the
fact
that
immigration
legal
and
illegal
is
accentuating
all
kinds
of
fears
in
much
of
the
public
in
the
past
and
in
many
other
countries
immigration
has
often
aroused
economic
insecurities
and
provoked
anxieties
about
the
unknown
but
in
the
united
states
today
immigration
seems
to
be
hitting
several
different
hot
buttons
at
once
most
current
immigrants
are
not
of
european
origins
and
so
their
growing
numbers
play
into
ageold
anxieties
about
race
as
well
as
newer
debates
over
issues
like
multiculturalism
because
many
are
poor
they
heighten
taxpayer
resentments
over
social
spending
because
immigration
policy
is
a
federal
matter
the
ongoing
illegal
influx
gets
tagged
as
one
more
sign
of
washingtons
incompetence
ragged
people
heading
north
in
makeshift
sea
vessels
become
symbols
of
a
world
that
is
out
of
control
and
unresponsive
to
american
imperatives
finally
all
of
these
factors
resonate
with
the
profound
but
often
poorly
articulated
concerns
over
the
nations
identity
direction
and
future
that
underlie
so
much
political
discourse
we
are
in
the
first
stage
of
the
postmodern
period
of
immigration
and
from
now
on
immigration
policy
is
going
to
be
addressed
in
a
fundamentally
different
way
than
in
the
past
says
wade
henderson
chief
of
the
naacps
washington
office
and
a
longtime
power
broker
on
immigration
issues
the
political
pressure
to
do
something
is
building
and
restrictionist
proposals
that
once
seemed
far
out
are
now
being
taken
seriously
nowhere
has
that
been
more
evident
than
in
congress
during
the
past
session
dozens
of
measures
were
introduced
to
further
reduce
illegal
immigrants
already
very
limited
access
to
public
benefits
to
greatly
expand
the
border
patrol
or
to
slash
the
number
of
visas
for
legal
immigrants
the
administration
together
with
key
democratic
leaders
managed
to
squash
all
the
big
proposals
and
by
late
summer
was
beginning
to
develop
a
legislative
initiative
for
next
year
rather
than
just
trying
to
stifle
all
the
action
we
are
going
to
put
out
our
own
proposals
in
1995
said
a
senior
administration
official
for
one
thing
we
would
not
be
able
to
keep
a
lid
on
this
issue
again
and
for
another
we
want
to
be
in
an
affirmative
posture
rather
that
on
the
defensive
going
into
the
96
elections
reno
has
already
said
that
the
administration
will
promote
measures
to
combat
document
fraud
and
to
enhance
enforcement
of
laws
prohibiting
employment
of
illegal
immigrants
it
may
also
seek
broader
authority
to
deal
with
immigration
emergencies
like
the
ones
that
erupted
in
the
caribbean
last
summer
where
the
legislative
proposals
will
begin
is
easy
to
figure
where
they
will
end
is
impossible
to
predict
two
major
questions
of
degree
remain
to
be
answered
how
far
is
the
public
willing
to
go
in
fighting
illegal
immigration
and
will
the
restrictionist
impulse
carry
over
into
legal
immigration
producing
substantial
cuts
in
the
number
of
people
admitted
whats
been
happening
with
refugees
is
very
much
tied
to
a
change
in
public
attitude
toward
immigration
in
general
said
diana
aviv
director
of
the
washington
office
of
the
council
of
jewish
federations
all
immigrants
now
tend
to
be
viewed
as
a
financial
burden
regardless
of
their
contribution
and
that
is
because
of
whats
happened
in
california
the
socalled
save
our
state
initiative
on
the
california
ballot
outlaws
virtually
all
services
to
illegal
immigrants
proposition
187
grew
out
of
wilsons
insistence
that
immigration
must
be
viewed
as
a
fiscal
issue
and
the
governor
has
been
its
most
prominent
supporter
but
cutting
costs
is
only
one
objective
proposition
187
would
require
public
officials
to
report
anyone
suspected
of
being
an
illegal
immigrant
alan
nelson
a
reaganera
immigration
official
and
a
coauthor
of
the
initiative
said
it
sends
a
message
to
the
illegal
alien
that
we
will
not
tolerate
their
living
here
against
the
law
and
that
they
should
go
home
opponents
which
include
the
states
largest
teacher
school
board
and
medical
associations
complain
that
the
intent
is
to
make
schools
and
hospitals
instruments
of
immigration
policy
the
goal
is
to
create
a
climate
of
fear
so
the
undocumented
will
leave
but
inevitably
anyone
who
looks
foreign
or
sounds
foreign
would
come
under
the
shadow
of
suspicion
said
scott
macdonald
spokesman
for
taxpayers
against
187
a
coalition
of
opponents
to
the
measure
the
jordan
commission
concluded
that
for
public
safety
reasons
immunizations
and
a
few
other
services
should
be
provided
to
illegal
immigrants
it
noted
also
that
efforts
to
restrict
illegal
immigrants
access
to
public
services
should
conform
to
constitutional
requirements
referring
to
the
1982
supreme
court
decision
mandating
that
all
children
receive
a
public
education
regardless
of
immigration
status
a
decision
that
proponents
of
proposition
187
seek
to
challenge
by
getting
the
initiative
enacted
they
had
a
powerful
voice
on
the
ninemember
commission
in
the
person
of
harold
ezell
a
former
immigration
service
official
who
coauthored
the
proposition
with
nelson
while
serving
on
jordans
panel
the
commissions
most
lasting
contribution
however
may
lie
in
a
policy
formulation
that
inextricably
links
legal
and
illegal
immigration
into
one
political
package
in
presenting
the
commissions
report
to
congress
jordan
said
if
we
are
to
preserve
our
immigration
tradition
and
our
ability
to
say
yes
to
so
many
of
those
who
seek
entry
we
must
also
have
the
strength
to
say
no
where
we
must
this
rhetoric
is
loaded
with
common
sense
and
it
has
been
employed
by
others
including
clinton
in
the
past
but
jordan
is
the
first
to
justify
a
massive
new
program
to
combat
illegal
immigration
on
the
basis
that
it
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
legal
immigration
while
ms
jordan
and
the
commission
probably
thought
that
they
were
reinforcing
the
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
immigration
they
may
have
unwittingly
contributed
to
the
further
blurring
of
that
distinction
said
demetrios
papademetriou
senior
associate
at
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
jordans
report
is
already
being
used
to
justify
measures
more
stringent
than
those
she
has
envisioned
proponents
of
cutbacks
in
legal
immigration
like
sen
alan
simpson
r
wyo
have
coined
a
corollary
to
her
argument
if
a
drastic
reduction
in
illegal
immigration
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
legal
flow
as
jordan
argued
then
the
legal
flow
should
be
cut
down
until
there
is
proof
that
illegal
immigration
has
been
brought
under
control
jordan
might
not
countenance
such
proposals
but
that
is
not
going
to
stop
anyone
in
the
superheated
atmosphere
that
surrounds
this
issue
preserving
the
credibility
of
the
immigration
system
is
the
slogan
cutting
costs
is
the
rationale
new
limits
are
the
objective
illegal
immigration
will
be
the
initial
target
but
fewer
legal
immigrants
may
be
the
inevitable
result
