by
inger
eberhart
the
basis
of
the
arizona
immigration
law
is
the
principle
of
attrition
through
enforcement
the
intent
section
of
the
law
says
that
this
act
is
to
make
attrition
through
enforcement
the
public
policy
of
all
state
and
local
government
agencies
in
arizona
attrition
through
enforcement
means
that
when
the
immigration
laws
are
enforced
illegal
aliens
selfdeport
the
passage
of
arizonas
law
and
the
threat
of
subsequent
enforcement
led
to
numerous
stories
of
illegal
aliens
leaving
arizona
enforcement
works
legalization
is
a
losing
proposition
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
21stcentury
speak
for
legalization
and
amnesty
when
the
1986
amnesty
was
proposed
about
15
million
illegal
agricultural
workers
were
said
to
be
eligible
over
3
million
illegal
aliens
were
eventually
granted
amnesty
as
a
result
of
fraud
and
misrepresentations
by
1997
there
were
5
million
illegal
aliens
today
we
have
12
million
to
20
million
in
the
united
states
amnesty
merely
encourages
more
illegal
immigration
and
does
not
solve
the
problem
former
congresswoman
barbara
jordan
the
clintonappointed
chairperson
of
the
commission
on
immigration
reform
stated
it
is
both
a
right
and
a
responsibility
of
a
democratic
society
to
manage
immigration
so
that
it
serves
the
national
interests
amnesty
did
not
serve
our
national
interests
in
1986
and
it
does
not
serve
it
today
arizonas
illegal
alien
population
is
460000
according
to
a
2008
study
by
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
georgias
illegal
alien
population
is
490000
their
presence
costs
georgia
over
16
billion
per
year
for
education
health
care
and
incarceration
of
illegal
aliens
according
to
fair
georgia
taxpayers
cannot
and
will
not
continue
to
underwrite
illegal
aliens
since
2006
we
have
had
the
georgia
security
and
immigration
compliance
act
which
has
served
as
a
blueprint
for
many
other
states
the
gsica
seeks
to
remove
incentives
for
illegal
immigration
such
as
the
illegal
acquisition
and
granting
of
public
benefits
and
illegal
employment
enforcement
of
gsica
is
crucial
while
national
unemployment
trends
toward
10
percent
georgias
unemployment
is
closer
to
103
percent
not
enforcing
our
immigration
laws
is
unconscionable
with
sb
1070
which
extends
local
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
laws
arizona
has
drawn
a
line
in
the
sand
it
is
time
for
georgia
to
do
the
same
through
the
287g
program
president
bill
clinton
signed
into
law
federal
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
partner
in
order
to
enforce
immigration
laws
under
georgia
law
and
287g
we
have
checked
the
nationality
and
immigration
status
of
those
jailed
for
dui
felonies
and
aggravated
misdemeanors
since
2009
if
the
person
is
in
the
united
states
illegally
jailers
are
required
to
report
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
287g
program
is
a
federal
tool
that
has
proven
so
effective
that
groups
like
the
georgia
association
of
latino
elected
officials
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
want
it
eliminated
georgia
should
now
extend
local
immigration
enforcement
by
adopting
arizonas
law
many
democratic
and
republican
candidates
for
public
office
have
already
committed
to
bringing
that
legislation
to
georgia
georgians
like
the
vast
majority
of
americans
are
ready
for
elected
officials
to
enforce
immigration
laws
and
defend
our
borders

the
asian
american
legal
advocacy
center
of
georgia
wants
an
end
to
illegal
immigration
aalac
believes
the
only
effective
way
to
solve
the
problem
is
through
passage
of
comprehensive
federal
immigration
reform
and
not
through
piecemeal
state
legislation
but
as
an
organization
that
principally
focuses
on
our
local
community
weve
sought
to
understand
this
issue
from
the
perspective
of
how
it
would
impact
regular
hardworking
asianamericans
and
others
state
immigration
laws
like
sb
1070
necessitate
unconstitutional
racial
profiling
hurting
legal
as
well
as
illegal
immigrants
and
common
sense
tells
us
that
when
police
are
trying
to
develop
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
someone
they
see
walking
down
the
street
or
driving
down
the
road
is
illegal
the
persons
skin
color
will
be
one
of
the
first
things
they
see
while
the
color
of
a
persons
skin
is
evident
a
persons
citizenship
status
is
not
imagine
being
arrested
one
day
because
you
forgot
to
carry
your
naturalization
papers
proving
your
citizenship
status
and
the
anger
you
would
feel
being
treated
as
a
secondclass
citizen
my
parents
came
to
the
united
states
because
they
believed
america
is
a
country
of
equal
opportunity
for
those
willing
to
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rules
that
ideal
is
actually
part
of
our
constitution
the
14th
amendment
requires
states
to
provide
equal
protection
under
the
law
for
all
people
within
its
jurisdiction
a
law
that
authorizes
detention
of
a
certain
group
of
people
based
on
race
or
color
goes
against
the
language
of
our
constitution
and
the
spirit
of
equal
access
that
brought
many
of
us
here
state
immigration
laws
will
create
a
confusing
patchwork
of
enforcement
policies
burdening
and
exposing
local
police
officers
to
unfair
lawsuits
aalac
believes
that
requiring
our
police
to
act
as
immigration
officials
a
responsibility
that
is
and
should
be
on
the
federal
government
will
create
tremendous
confusion
and
cost
in
implementation
among
different
police
agencies
already
in
arizona
police
are
dealing
with
a
mishmash
of
different
training
materials
policing
guidelines
and
rules
based
on
each
agencys
interpretation
of
sb
1070
in
one
county
a
police
officer
is
trained
to
let
a
driver
go
with
a
citation
if
the
officer
cannot
confirm
the
drivers
legal
status
while
a
police
officer
in
another
county
is
trained
to
send
that
same
driver
to
border
patrol
and
while
one
officer
may
decide
to
detain
an
individual
for
speaking
english
poorly
another
officer
might
decide
limited
english
proficiency
is
not
a
reasonable
factor
in
suspecting
a
persons
legal
status
and
under
sb
1070
the
decisions
of
our
police
could
later
be
the
subject
of
a
citizens
lawsuit
challenging
an
individual
officer
for
failing
to
follow
procedure
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
law
patchwork
enforcement
policies
will
lead
to
unfair
exposure
for
police
and
could
potentially
jeopardize
the
trust
and
collaboration
between
the
community
and
the
police
its
not
just
a
latino
issue
before
asianamericans
or
others
feel
this
is
just
a
latino
issue
lets
not
forget
that
discriminatory
immigration
laws
targeting
asians
existed
for
more
than
80
years
in
the
united
states
starting
with
the
chinese
exclusion
act
of
1882
and
lets
also
not
forget
that
in
the
current
day
and
in
our
state
we
hear
of
asianamericans
being
discriminated
against
and
targeted
based
on
their
ethnicity
or
lack
of
english
language
proficiency
we
cant
afford
to
repeat
history
and
must
come
together
to
promote
a
reasoned
compassionate
and
comprehensive
answer
to
our
immigration
crisis
