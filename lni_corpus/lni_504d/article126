in
the
last
several
years
with
comprehensive
reform
of
the
us
immigration
system
mired
in
debate
numerous
states
have
tried
to
take
matters
in
their
own
hands
to
solve
the
problem
of
11
million
undocumented
immigrants
pleading
frustration
with
the
glacial
pace
of
the
federal
government
state
legislatures
and
even
some
municipalities
have
enacted
their
own
immigrationrelated
statutes
state
laws
have
addressed
everything
from
requiring
employers
to
comply
with
additional
employment
compliance
requirements
to
authorizing
local
law
enforcement
to
question
individuals
they
reasonably
suspect
are
undocumented
these
laws
have
proliferated
throughout
the
country
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
reports
that
44
state
legislatures
passed
191
laws
and
adopted
128
immigrationrelated
resolutions
in
2010
and
more
than
100
local
governments
have
enacted
immigrationrelated
ordinances
the
state
of
arizona
has
led
the
way
enacting
two
controversial
immigration
laws
in
the
last
four
years
the
2007
legal
arizona
workers
act
and
last
summers
controversial
senate
bill
sb
1070
and
now
considering
a
third
even
harsher
bill
in
some
states
however
a
more
pragmatic
trend
may
be
emerging
at
the
most
basic
level
states
facing
fiscal
crisis
are
beginning
to
question
the
high
cost
of
harsh
state
immigration
provisions
state
laws
that
empower
police
to
inquire
about
immigration
status
can
lead
to
increased
expenses
related
to
arrest
processing
and
jail
including
the
cost
of
building
more
facilities
to
hold
the
undocumented
while
they
await
deportation
by
the
federal
government
and
states
hungry
for
additional
revenue
are
reluctant
to
follow
in
arizonas
footsteps
where
an
estimated
140
million
was
lost
in
boycotts
and
other
business
impacts
of
sb
1070
states
are
also
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
federal
government
has
postponed
implementation
of
the
real
id
act
which
would
impose
drivers
license
security
standards
including
immigration
status
checks
on
state
dmvs
the
postponement
is
in
part
due
to
the
financial
burdens
real
id
will
place
on
already
tight
state
budgets
and
in
states
that
have
enacted
or
are
considering
restrictive
statutes
some
are
pushing
back
in
florida
state
legislators
are
working
to
relax
an
executive
order
signed
by
governor
rick
scott
that
would
require
employers
to
use
the
largely
voluntary
federal
everify
employment
verification
system
after
business
and
agricultural
groups
among
others
protested
in
georgia
where
tough
immigration
measures
are
wending
their
way
through
the
legislature
business
leaders
have
warned
that
the
bill
could
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
states
agriculture
industry
business
groups
have
also
opposed
restrictionist
proposals
in
kansas
and
oklahoma
in
at
least
one
state
legislators
have
attempted
to
balance
tough
enforcement
laws
with
ameliorating
provisions
in
a
kind
of
state
facsimile
of
a
model
federal
comprehensive
bill
in
recent
days
utah
governor
gary
herbert
signed
into
law
a
package
of
immigration
bills
that
includes
provisions
for
tougher
enforcement
similar
to
arizonas
sb
1070
a
labor
agreement
with
mexico
and
a
statelevel
guest
worker
program
how
such
a
program
would
be
implemented
remains
seriously
in
question
since
it
would
require
utah
to
seek
a
federal
waiver
of
the
prohibition
against
employing
undocumented
workers
still
the
utah
experiment
demonstrates
that
the
all
restrictions
all
the
time
stance
of
state
legislatures
may
be
shifting
as
lawmakers
begin
to
realize
the
negative
effects
of
enforcementonly
provisions
and
recognize
states
economic
need
for
the
undocumented
workers
who
shoulder
much
of
the
labor
burden
in
the
agriculture
construction
and
hospitality
industries
among
others
soon
however
the
us
supreme
court
will
weigh
in
on
state
action
in
the
immigration
context
and
will
decide
important
questions
about
federal
supremacy
in
the
area
of
immigration
the
court
is
expected
to
rule
later
this
year
on
whether
the
legal
arizona
workers
act
impermissibly
conflicts
with
federal
law
and
thus
is
preempted
by
it
the
ninth
circuit
will
soon
rule
on
whether
arizonas
sb
1070
conflicts
with
federal
immigration
enforcement
laws
after
the
most
controversial
provisions
of
the
state
law
were
preliminarily
enjoined
on
that
ground
last
summer
one
key
question
is
whether
courts
will
find
justification
for
state
immigration
laws
in
the
federal
governments
inaction
but
even
if
these
state
laws
are
upheld
their
effectiveness
is
doubtful
while
states
may
have
some
ability
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
immigration
a
patchwork
of
state
immigration
laws
will
do
little
to
decisively
resolve
the
fate
of
the
us
undocumented
population
and
has
already
caused
uncertainty
confusion
and
unpredictability
for
business
at
best
state
action
is
a
side
show
to
the
main
event
comprehensive
federal
reform
of
the
us
immigration
system
