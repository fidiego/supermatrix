immigration
has
not
played
a
prominent
role
in
this
years
election
except
early
on
among
gop
hopefuls
who
were
marginal
from
the
outset
perhaps
in
part
because
republicans
saw
so
many
immigration
restrictionists
go
down
in
flames
in
the
process
of
losing
control
of
congress
in
2006
and
in
part
because
the
eventual
gop
candidate
john
mccain
is
not
a
restrictionist
and
the
party
has
embraced
him
however
clumsily
for
fear
of
obama
but
the
nativists
still
ply
their
trade
on
talk
radio
and
in
other
venues
so
the
urge
to
limit
immigration
and
do
something
punitive
about
the
12
million
or
so
immigrants
who
are
here
illegally
is
not
likely
to
disappear
i
have
long
contended
that
the
problem
is
overly
restrictive
immigration
laws
were
in
an
economic
slump
just
now
and
unemployment
is
edging
up
but
for
many
years
illegal
immigration
coexisted
with
historically
low
levels
of
unemployment
suggesting
strongly
that
immigrants
legal
or
illegal
were
not
taking
jobs
from
nativeborn
americans
who
wanted
them
the
notion
that
some
bureaucrat
in
washington
knows
better
than
employers
in
santa
ana
or
san
diego
how
many
employees
some
business
really
needs
is
sheer
folly
a
mere
book
might
not
change
the
equation
but
if
any
book
deserves
to
have
such
an
impact
it
is
let
them
in
the
case
for
open
borders
by
wall
street
journal
editorial
writer
jason
riley
writing
from
a
strongly
conservative
reaganite
freemarket
perspective
while
occasionally
impassioned
and
sardonic
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
sober
demolition
of
six
of
the
most
prominent
arguments
against
open
immigration
using
the
most
reliable
studies
and
statistics
available
it
demonstrates
that
there
is
simply
no
intellectually
coherent
case
for
restricting
immigration
and
that
in
fact
to
restrict
immigration
would
do
this
country
serious
harm
the
six
arguments
riley
takes
on
are
common
enough
the
country
is
already
overpopulated
and
letting
more
people
in
will
degrade
the
quality
of
life
for
everyone
and
harm
the
environment
immigrants
take
jobs
from
the
nativeborn
and
especially
harm
those
at
the
lower
end
of
the
socialeconomic
spectrum
immigrants
are
disproportionate
users
of
welfare
this
wave
of
immigrants
is
uniquely
dangerous
to
american
culture
and
will
resist
assimilation
into
ordinary
american
life
immigration
is
a
shrewd
wedge
issue
that
can
increase
republican
turnout
and
finally
unrestricted
immigration
especially
illegal
immigration
poses
a
serious
threat
to
national
security
in
this
era
of
terrorist
activity
undertaken
by
shadowy
stateless
groups
in
his
introduction
riley
notes
that
none
of
these
arguments
is
new
some
of
our
most
famous
forebears
fretted
about
immigration
from
our
earliest
days
ben
franklin
railed
against
swarms
of
unassimilable
germans
taking
over
pennsylvania
250
years
ago
in
the
early
19th
century
the
irish
were
the
bogeymen
who
were
going
to
subvert
angloamerican
values
and
prosperity
then
it
was
the
chinese
brought
over
to
build
railroads
and
do
other
coolie
work
during
the
period
of
heaviest
immigration
from
18901910
jews
catholics
and
various
eastern
and
southern
europeans
provoked
fear
that
they
would
be
a
permanent
underclass
or
would
outbreed
complacent
natives
but
the
arguments
were
wrong
then
and
they
are
wrong
now
the
united
states
is
nowhere
close
to
being
overpopulated
immigration
compensates
for
declining
birth
rates
and
people
are
the
ultimate
resource
riley
argues
that
immigrant
workers
tend
to
act
as
complements
to
the
native
workforce
rather
than
substitutes
and
backs
it
up
with
nuanced
economic
analysis
immigrants
legal
and
illegal
of
comparable
economic
classes
use
welfare
and
commit
crimes
at
a
lower
rate
than
nativeborn
americans
even
harvard
economist
george
borjas
who
advocates
immigration
restriction
for
other
reasons
notes
that
although
the
presumed
magnetic
attraction
of
welfare
comes
up
most
often
in
the
immigration
debate
it
is
also
the
one
for
which
there
is
no
empirical
support
mexican
immigrants
are
assimilating
at
about
the
same
rate
as
previous
waves
of
immigrants
the
political
argument
is
especially
devastating
many
of
the
most
vociferous
antiimmigrant
gop
candidates
were
defeated
in
the
republican
wipeout
of
2006
but
using
immigration
as
a
wedge
issue
drove
down
hispanic
votes
for
republicans
which
had
been
increasing
since
1996
so
far
no
terrorist
has
come
across
the
southern
border
that
we
know
of
but
the
best
way
to
guard
against
the
possibility
is
to
liberalize
immigration
laws
so
authorities
can
focus
on
potential
terrorists
rather
than
people
who
want
to
mow
your
lawn
immigration
is
an
emotional
issue
and
some
people
seem
to
be
immune
to
reasoned
debate
and
discussion
but
for
those
who
are
still
making
up
their
minds
and
despite
the
noise
polls
show
that
this
describes
the
majority
of
americans
this
book
is
likely
to
be
powerfully
persuasive
titlelet

in
the
case
for
open
borders
