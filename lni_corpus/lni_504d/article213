when
maria
esthers
father
fell
sick
in
mexico
five
years
ago
she
found
herself
tangled
in
a
twisted
web
of
immigration
policy
an
undocumented
immigrant
esther
knew
that
returning
to
her
homeland
would
end
her
future
in
america
and
keep
her
from
her
usborn
daughter
monserrat
cabrera
also
suffering
from
a
serious
illness
at
the
time
so
esther
remained
in
san
jose
while
her
father
died
south
of
the
border
all
i
could
do
was
watch
my
mom
cry
said
monserrat

mom
stayed
with
me
instead
of
telling
her
dad
goodbye
emotions
were
palpable
thursday
night
at
san
joses
st
patrick
protocathedral
where
hundreds
of
immigration
reform
advocates
listened
to
testimonies
from
young
undocumented
locals
and
reassurances
from
rep
zoe
lofgren
dsan
jose
that
the
time
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
now
despite
a
push
by
former
president
george
w
bush
congress
in
2006
and
2007
failed
to
pass
immigration
reform
lofgren
who
chairs
the
house
of
representatives
subcommittee
on
immigration
relayed
president
barack
obamas
commitment
to
change
the
nations
immigration
policy
but
she
made
clear
that
such
legislation
will
be
difficult
to
pass
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
tough
fight
lofgren
said
theres
a
reason
it
hasnt
been
done
yet
and
thats
because
its
hard
to
do
the
fight
for
healthcare
reform
seems
to
be
delaying
if
not
overshadowing
the
immigration
debate
but
only
for
the
moment
immigration
activists
say
senate
majority
leader
harry
reid
dnev
has
said
many
times
that
he
will
set
aside
time
for
immigration
reform
to
be
debated
when
congress
reconvenes
in
the
fall
said
paul
donnelly
a
longtime
proimmigration
activist
in
washington
dc
donnelly
said
he
believes
passing
immigration
legislation
may
actually
be
much
easier
than
anyone
expected
and
he
lauded
the
work
of
lofgren
and
sen
chuck
schumer
dny
who
is
drafting
legislation
to
present
to
congress
after
labor
day
proimmigration
activists
say
the
legislation
must
be
comprehensive
addressing
issues
across
the
spectrum
of
immigration
policy
such
as
status
verification
visa
control
and
labor
law
to
garner
enough
support
to
pass
the
senate
and
the
house
and
in
the
context
of
a
recession
reform
advocates
are
pushing
the
point
that
immigrants
are
key
drivers
of
the
economy
especially
in
california
look
at
the
immigration
that
is
the
lifeblood
of
san
jose
its
an
enormous
engine
for
silicon
valleys
economy
donnelly
said
we
want
to
be
serious
about
closing
the
back
door
to
illegal
immigration
so
that
we
can
open
the
front
door
to
legal
immigration
obama
who
pledged
during
his
campaign
to
tackle
immigration
this
year
has
been
criticized
for
not
pushing
the
democraticcontrolled
congress
hard
enough
to
counter
that
criticism
the
president
tapped
homeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
early
in
the
summer
to
be
the
administrations
point
person
for
the
debate
the
president
however
told
hispanic
reporters
at
the
white
house
on
friday
that
next
years
congressional
election
campaigns
will
further
complicate
the
debate
obama
also
said
he
doesnt
know
if
an
immigration
bill
would
have
enough
votes
to
pass
congress
but
for
reform
activists
especially
those
who
are
undocumented
the
debate
on
immigration
is
more
than
politics
its
their
livelihoods
