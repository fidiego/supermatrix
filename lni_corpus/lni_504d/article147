attacks
sen
barbara

dcalif
on
its
core
issues
saying
that

doesnt
share
our

because
she
supports
abortion
and
homosexual

the

also
attacks
boxer
on

saying
she
voted
against

to
permit
our
people
to

legally
to

its
a
surprising
attack
given
that
boxer
is
a
wellknown
advocate
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
boxer
has
long
favored
tougher
border
security
but
she
has
also
advocated
a
path
to
citizenship
for
the
estimated
12
million
illegal
immigrants
currently
in
the
united
states
asked
for
backup
for
the
ads
claim
about
boxer
a
spokesman
for
sba
list
pointed
us
toward
a
may
23
2007
story
in
the
new
york
times
that
notes
boxers
opposition
to
a
guest
worker
provision
proposed
for
the
comprehensive
immigration
reform
initiative
that
year
according
to
the
story
senator
barbara
boxer
democrat
of
california
denounced
the
guest
worker
program
saying
it
would
create
a
pool
of
desperate
lowwage
workers
whom
employers
could
easily
exploit
the
guest
worker
program
proposed
in
the
2007
immigration
bill
was
part
of
the
negotiated
grand
bargain
that
sought
to
get
bipartisan
support
for
the
bill
the
program
would
have
allowed
temporary
visas
for
several
hundred
thousand
immigrants
to
fill
unskilled
jobs
the
visas
could
be
renewed
twice
so
long
as
the
guest
worker
returned
to
his
home
country
for
at
least
a
year
between
visits
and
to
return
the
worker
would
need
sponsorship
from
an
employer
many
immigration
advocates
feared
it
would
create
an
environment
where
employers
could
abuse
guest
workers
because
they
could
control
whether
that
guest
worker
could
return
and
boxer
voted
to
eliminate
it
a
may
29
2007
editorial
in
the
new
york
times
described
the
guest
worker
provision
in
the
bill
as
an
absurd
employment
hokeypokey
you
put
your
two
years
in
then
one
year
out
then
repeat
that
twice
and
go
home
forever
it
would
be
massive
indentured
servitude
colonial
times
all
over
again
but
without
any
hope
of
citizenship
for
those
taking
our
most
difficult
and
despised
jobs
the
ad
doesnt
explain
any
of
this
background
it
merely
says
boxer
voted
against
immigration
reform
to
permit
our
people
to
come
here
legally
to
work
in
fact
boxer
has
long
been
a
strong
proponent
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
in
2006
she
voted
for
an
immigration
reform
package
that
included
a
more
immigrantfriendly
temporary
guest
worker
provision
in
addition
while
she
voted
against
the
version
of
the
guest
worker
provision
included
in
the
2007
immigration
reform
bill
she
ultimately
voted
to
continue
debating
the
bill
although
it
subsequently
died
boxers
campaign
also
notes
that
she
cosponsored
the
agjobs
act
of
2009
to
allow
illegal
immigrants
who
work
in
the
fields
to
get
temporary
visas
and
eventually
a
path
to
permanent
residency
and
in
april
2010
boxer
and
15
other
senators
sent
a
letter
to
president
barack
obama
expressing
support
for
a
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bill
this
year
marc
rosenblum
senior
policy
analyst
at
the
migration
policy
institute
said
the
ad
suggests
she
has
been
an
antiimmigration
vote
in
congress
and
thats
not
accurate
she
voted
against
that
piece
of
it
mark
krikorian
executive
director
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
nonpartisan
research
group
that
supports
lower
levels
of
immigration
said
the
ad
is
clearly
intended
to
convey
that
shes
against
what
advocates
call
comprehensive
immigration
reform
when
in
fact
shes
all
for
the
leftwing
version
of
it
what
she
voted
against
was
the
third
leg
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
which
is
insisted
on
by
the
business
and
libertarian
right
which
is
the
increased
importation
of
captive
labor
via
guestworker
programs
the
immigration
attack
on
boxer
doesnt
come
completely
from
left
field
trailing
badly
in
polls
among
californias
latino
voters
republican
carly
fiorina
who
has
backed
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
has
used
similar
criticisms
of
boxer
in
an
attempt
to
weaken
the
democrat
with
latino
voters
according
to
an
oct
6
2010
story
in
the
los
angeles
times
though
fiorina
has
revealed
little
about
how
she
would
approach
immigration
issues
she
has
sharply
criticized
boxer
for
seeking
to
strip
a
proposed
temporary
worker
program
from
federal
immigration
legislation
in
2007
that
ultimately
collapsed
in
the
senate
we
think
the
ads
claim
about
boxers
record
on
immigration
is
highly
misleading
it
states
simply
that
boxer
voted
against
immigration
reform
to
permit
our
people
to
come
here
legally
to
work
boxer
did
not
vote
against
the
immigration
reform
bill
in
2007
she
voted
against
a
provision
in
it
that
she
felt
would
lead
to
the
exploitation
of
immigrant
workers
moreover
the
ad
ignores
boxers
history
of
support
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
including
a
program
to
allow
immigrants
to
come
to
the
united
states
to
work
legally
we
rate
the
ads
