knowing
the
possible
consequences
legal
community
works
to
ensure
defendants
know
plea
agreements
could
impact
immigration
status
in
her
allen
superior
courtroom
judge
fran
gull
makes
a
point
to
tell
every
defendant
who
comes
before
her
that
signing
a
guilty
plea
could
impact
his
or
her
immigration
status
until
recently
the
judge
didnt
provide
that
warning
but
a
ruling
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
march
2010
made
her
more
mindful
of
what
those
appearing
before
her
know
and
she
wants
to
ensure
they
understand
that
signing
a
plea
agreement
could
impact
their
immigration
status
or
residency
in
this
country
the
holding
in
padilla
v
kentucky
requires
criminal
defense
attorneys
to
advise
clients
about
possible
immigrationrelated
consequences
that
might
materialize
from
signing
a
plea
agreement
the
ruling
created
ripple
effects
throughout
the
legal
community
as
more
lawyers
and
judges
have
grappled
with
how
to
best
respect
the
spirit
of
that
ruling
and
many
are
shifting
their
practices
and
policies
to
make
sure
that
notification
isnt
overlooked
while
lawyers
are
tasked
with
making
sure
clients
are
aware
of
the
impact
some
have
decided
the
courts
should
be
the
final
gatekeepers
in
ensuring
defendants
sixth
amendment
rights
are
protected
and
lawyers
arent
rendering
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
the
dilemma
we
face
is
that
if
we
dont
ask
everybody
were
going
to
be
accused
of
profiling
and
not
treating
everyone
the
same
gull
said
having
the
court
handle
the
warning
in
the
guilty
plea
stage
prevents
defendants
from
coming
back
later
and
saying
they
were
never
warned
allen
countys
approach
is
one
that
more
judges
are
considering
after
the
padilla
ruling
came
down
some
had
already
started
using
a
similar
approach
because
of
past
indiana
appellate
caselaw
implying
that
requirement
but
a
consistent
approach
hasnt
been
established
courts
continue
studying
padilla
and
its
impacts
and
some
judges
in
marion
and
lake
counties
say
individually
they
are
notifying
defendants
during
initial
or
plea
hearings
about
the
possible
immigration
consequences
they
could
face
in
marion
county
superior
judge
mark
stoner
says
that
he
has
been
asking
defendants
about
those
negative
immigration
effects
if
the
person
has
an
interpreter
and
confirms
being
a
citizen
of
another
country
the
prosecutors
office
incorporates
language
mentioning
deportation
in
major
felony
guilty
plea
agreements
he
said
lake
superior
judge
tom
stefaniak
said
hes
also
notifying
defendants
during
initial
and
plea
hearings
though
he
says
not
all
criminal
and
county
court
judges
are
doing
that
taking
responsibility
not
everyone
in
the
legal
community
agrees
the
courts
should
be
taking
that
approach
so
late
in
a
case
since
it
falls
on
an
attorneys
shoulders
to
provide
that
notification
and
legal
advice
but
in
the
end
both
courts
and
lawyers
are
working
together
to
make
sure
defendants
understand
the
possible
immigration
implications
of
pleading
guilty
developments
in
immigration
law
since
1990
have
made
the
whole
situation
progressively
more
threatening
for
aliens
convicted
of
a
broad
range
of
criminal
offenses
including
many
that
formerly
generated
no
immigration
penalties
said
john
scanlan
a
professor
emeritus
at
indiana
university
maurer
school
of
law
the
bottom
line
is
that
many
criminal
lawyers
face
sanctions
unless
they
learn
a
lot
of
immigration
law
fast
and
everyone
is
trying
to
make
sure
this
is
addressed
questions
remain
open
following
the
ruling
specifically
whether
padilla
is
retroactive
and
whether
the
holding
covers
collateral
consequences
outside
the
deportation
context
the
7th
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
august
that
padilla
is
not
retroactive
but
the
circuits
are
split
on
that
issue
and
the
scotus
will
likely
need
to
weigh
on
at
some
point
in
the
meantime
public
defenders
have
voiced
concern
that
the
decision
puts
additional
pressure
on
them
to
advise
clients
on
complex
immigration
issues
and
in
other
areas
of
the
law
unfamiliar
to
them
that
concern
has
led
both
prosecutors
and
defenders
to
learn
more
about
immigration
law
and
to
seek
out
more
information
from
fellow
attorneys
practicing
in
immigration
law
theres
a
lot
more
overlap
than
weve
ever
had
before
indianapolis
immigration
attorney
john
broyles
said
about
criminal
and
immigration
law
from
our
side
were
getting
more
criminal
defense
attorneys
referring
clients
to
us
and
were
working
more
closely
with
a
larger
group
statewide
than
ever
before
broyles
said
the
biggest
issue
is
attorney
awareness
and
making
sure
they
are
adequately
advising
clients
about
the
possible
immigration
effects
he
found
many
immigration
clients
postpadilla
had
been
inadequately
advised
in
a
criminal
case
or
not
even
told
about
the
possible
immigration
consequences
unless
you
know
substantive
immigration
law
its
hard
to
look
into
the
future
and
know
how
this
could
impact
your
client
broyles
said
criminal
defense
attorneys
have
to
figure
out
what
a
clients
immigration
status
is
something
not
always
easy
in
itself
and
then
be
able
to
determine
how
a
conviction
could
impact
possible
future
immigration
cases
that
use
complex
standards
and
fall
under
different
laws
broyles
sees
a
danger
that
some
attorneys
might
start
developing
a
pattern
for
certain
types
of
clients
and
cases
thinking
that
one
is
similar
to
another
without
taking
all
the
nuances
and
variations
into
account
dont
assume
the
next
person
who
comes
in
with
an
identity
theft
case
warrants
the
same
plea
agreement
you
just
gave
to
someone
else
in
an
identity
theft
case
he
said
im
really
hopeful
they
seek
out
immigration
counsel
and
get
that
specific
information
they
need
on
a
casebycase
basis
indianapolis
attorney
dave
cook
former
marion
county
public
defender
who
went
into
immigrationfocused
criminal
defense
after
leaving
office
in
2007
said
he
filed
multiple
postconviction
relief
petitions
for
clients
after
padilla
came
down
before
padilla
cook
said
that
there
was
a
mistaken
belief
in
the
defense
bar
that
it
was
sometimes
better
to
not
know
about
those
immigration
consequences
so
that
if
asked
an
attorney
couldnt
be
held
to
that
knowledge
for
example
he
handled
a
drug
case
where
a
mans
previous
lawyer
went
on
the
court
record
saying
that
a
misdemeanor
drug
conviction
wouldnt
result
in
deportation
when
in
fact
immigration
law
says
that
those
lesser
crimes
could
count
against
someone
you
recognize
that
when
you
do
criminal
work
many
people
are
penaltyfocused
in
criminal
cases
and
theyre
only
looking
at
whether
they
will
go
to
jail
and
for
how
long
he
said
so
often
you
have
clients
who
are
willing
to
plead
as
long
as
they
can
avoid
jail
as
a
lawyer
you
have
to
look
past
that
penal
interest
and
whether
youll
win
the
criminal
case
and
focus
on
the
bigger
picture
of
how
this
persons
life
might
be
impacted
in
allen
county
gull
is
trying
to
make
sure
those
who
come
before
her
in
court
know
that
plea
agreements
could
impact
their
residency
she
has
gotten
many
surprised
looks
from
people
during
the
guilty
plea
process
when
she
mentions
the
immigration
consequences
whether
or
not
the
attorney
may
have
informed
that
person
about
the
immigration
possibilities
isnt
the
point
gull
said
its
about
taking
another
step
to
make
sure
defendants
understand
their
rights
its
making
a
nice
clean
record
so
these
issues
dont
come
back
to
haunt
us
she
said
but
a
courts
approach
providing
the
notification
isnt
the
answer
to
what
the
padilla
court
found
as
a
problem
cook
said
as
an
attorney
whos
successfully
merged
immigration
and
criminal
defense
practices
he
doesnt
think
the
court
notification
addresses
the
concern
because
its
aimed
more
at
protecting
the
courts
and
not
the
defendants
rights
putting
a
clause
in
the
agreement
and
telling
them
about
it
doesnt
really
resolve
the
issue
of
whether
their
attorney
has
given
adequate
counsel
he
said
noting
that
if
a
court
says
anything
about
this
it
should
be
at
the
earliest
point
in
the
process
and
not
at
the
last
stage
of
a
guilty
plea
hearing
from
a
judges
perspective
it
may
fix
any
problem
they
might
see
from
this
but
it
doesnt
really
fix
the
problem
that
exists
about
adequate
representation
you
cant
take
that
from
the
lawyers
hands
because
its
that
persons
job
to
make
sure
their
client
truly
understands
