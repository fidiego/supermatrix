echoes
the
kansas
mayors
coalition
in
its
call
to
congress
to
recognize
the
impact
of
any
immigration
reform
on
local
governments
immigration
legislation
should
not
burden
local
governments
with
extra
law
enforcement
or
administrative
burdens
similar
to
this
influential
group
of
kansas
mayors
nlc
believes
it
is
the
federal
governments
responsibility
to
adopt
a
national
immigration
policy
that
balances
national
security
needs
with
renewed
efforts
to
grow
the
nations
workforce
and
allows
local
economies
to
grow
while
protecting
the
quality
of
life
for
all
americans
the
kansas
mayors
call

legislation
and
specifically
asking
the
delegation
to
support
s
744
the
senate
bill
that

the
call
from

mirrors
the
current
national

to
a

been
urging
their
colleagues
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
pass
an
immigration
reform
bill
similar
to
the
senate
bill
although
the
house
will
continue
its
debate
on
immigration
reform
when

return
from

the
direction
