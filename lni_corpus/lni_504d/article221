in
the
final
days
of
the
omaha
mayors
race
hal
daub
and
jim
suttle
are
exchanging
charges
over
whether
omaha
police
should
help
enforce
federal
immigration
laws
daub
said
he
favors
police
playing
a
strong
role
while
suttle
said
he
would
not
make
it
a
priority
both
men
said
police
should
notify
federal
authorities
when
they
arrest
someone
who
is
an
illegal
immigrant
suttle
triggered
the
immigration
debate
last
month
when
he
told
a
neighborhood
gathering
that
the
united
states
is
the
only
country
that
has
it
all
wrong
on
immigration
he
said
the
nation
accomplishes
little
by
criminalizing
illegal
immigrants
or
businesses
that
employ
illegal
immigrants
daub
said
suttles
comments
show
that
he
would
not
enforce
the
nations
immigration
laws
in
an
interview
suttle
responded
that
immigration
was
a
federal
issue
while
he
would
enforce
all
laws
as
mayor
he
would
not
make
the
detention
of
illegal
immigrants
a
priority
im
not
interested
in
having
the
omaha
police
department
take
over
the
duties
of
the
fbi
or
the
immigration
services
suttle
said
daub
said
suttle
was
trying
to
explain
away
his
immigration
views
hes
trying
to
blow
smoke
and
obfuscate
what
he
said
in
10
days
voters
will
choose
daub
or
suttle
as
omahas
50th
mayor
the

immigration
historically
has
been
a
federal
responsibility
the
federal
government
oversees
the
nations
borders
and
the
deportation
of
illegal
immigrants
increasingly
state
and
local
governments
have
been
passing
or
considering
ordinances
to
deal
with
immigration
for
example
a
group
of
citizens
in
fremont
is
pushing
an
ordinance
that
would
make
it
illegal
for
businesses
to
hire
and
landlords
to
rent
to
illegal
immigrants
suttle
made
the
original
comments
after
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
allow
omaha
police
officers
to
help
enforce
immigration
laws
in
some
cities
mayors
sign
statements
saying
they
will
help
us
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
the
enforcement
arm
of
federal
immigration
services
generally
not
he
told
the
questioner
because
it
will
suck
up
all
the
resources
we
want
to
get
parks
done
streets
done
or
anything
else
we
need
to
get
the
united
states
congress
to
do
what
it
hasnt
done
for
40
years
thats
put
a
policy
in
place
that
works
for
companies
and
for
immigrants
we
need
to
go
to
the
source
of
the
problem
and
quit
making
criminals
out
of
the
companies
quit
making
criminals
out
of
people
however
they
might
come
across
the
border
suttle
continued
europe
does
it
the
right
way
asia
does
it
the
right
way
were
the
only
country
that
does
it
the
wrong
way
daub
said
the
statements
indicated
that
suttle
favored
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants
clearly
what
he
said
and
what
he
meant
was
that
he
wants
to
make
illegal
immigration
legal
he
said
he
also
is
clearly
opposed
to
omaha
cooperating
with
federal
officials
to
fight
illegal
immigration
daub
said
he
favors
police
helping
to
enforce
immigration
laws
whenever
officers
encounter
illegal
immigrants
during
the
normal
course
of
their
workday
suttle
said
police
should
notify
federal
authorities
if
they
arrest
someone
who
is
an
illegal
immigrant
as
for
his
comments
about
america
getting
it
wrong
suttle
said
they
were
based
on
his
experience
working
with
hdr
inc
the
omahabased
engineering
company
that
has
an
international
program
other
countries
allow
companies
to
recruit
outside
workers
if
they
are
sponsored
by
a
citizen
and
if
they
have
a
particular
expertise
needed
by
the
company
suttle
said
it
makes
it
very
simple
it
makes
everything
legal
he
said
why
go
into
punitive
things
and
have
people
in
violation
of
the
laws
when
we
can
find
other
ways
to
make
it
work
he
added
suttle
did
not
suggest
how
the
federal
government
should
overhaul
immigration
laws
he
said
his
focus
is
on
creating
jobs
and
reducing
crime
suttle
said
daub
is
trying
to
hide
his
own
record
on
immigration
daub
voted
against
a
1986
immigration
overhaul
package
when
he
was
in
the
us
house
the
bill
was
pushed
by
thenpresident
ronald
reagan
the
proposal
toughened
penalties
on
businesses
that
knowingly
hired
illegal
immigrants
it
also
provided
a
path
to
citizenship
for
illegal
immigrants
living
in
the
country
an
estimated
27
million
people
were
granted
citizenship
under
the
1986
law
hal
is
using
this
immigration
issue
to
criticize
me
when
hes
covering
up
his
own
positions
on
immigration
suttle
said
daub
said
he
is
proud
of
his
vote
against
the
bill
several
us
cities
have
become
socalled
sanctuary
cities
thats
when
city
employees
are
prohibited
from
asking
about
a
persons
immigration
status
for
example
police
would
not
be
able
to
ask
a
rape
victim
if
she
were
legally
in
the
country
daub
and
suttle
said
they
oppose
omaha
becoming
a
sanctuary
city
the
city
needs
to
enforce
the
laws
suttle
said
when
someone
gets
arrested
and
it
turns
out
theyre
undocumented
they
should
be
turned
over
to
federal
authorities
