the

É
were
talking
about
a
population
increase
under
the
senate
bill
of
over
70
million
people
in
20
years
dan
stein
on
sunday
july
7th
2013
in
an
interview
on
cbs
face
the
nation
the
ruling
false
as
the
immigration
debate
moves
from
the
senate
to
the
house
supporters
and
opponents
have
been
firing
claims
back
and
forth
a
reader
pointed
us
toward
one
claim
raised
by
a
critic
of
the
bill
on
cbs
face
the
nation
the
socalled
path
to
citizenship
amnesty
program
is
a
fraction
of
what
the
deal
bills
with
said
dan
stein
who
heads
a
group
that
opposes
the
bill
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
or
fair
on
july
7
2013
ultimately
it
unleashes
a
massive
increase
in
overall
immigration
essentially
it
gives
up
on
the
american
worker
by
simply
suggesting
that
at
every
level
of
the
labor
market
employers
should
be
able
to
bring
in
foreign
workers
were
talking
about
a
population
increase
under
the
senate
bill
of
over
70
million
people
in
20
years
70
million
people
the
reader
wondered
whether
the
bill
really
unleashes
a
massive
increase
in
overall
immigration
of
over
70
million
people
in
20
years
in
asking
us
to
check
the
item
the
reader
noted
that
such
an
increase
in
the
immigrant
population
would
amount
to
a
22
percent
increase
over
the
current
us
population
estimate
of
3163
million
an
increase
the
reader
said
sounds
implausibly
high
as
support
for
steins
claim
eric
ruark
fairs
director
of
research
pointed
us
to
a
paper
by
the
center
for
immigration
studies
while
the
center
has
strong
opinions
on
immigration
policy
its
generally
skeptical
of
expanding
immigration
the
groups
study
used
data
from
two
sources
without
a
dog
in
the
fight
the
congressional
budget
office
and
the
census
bureau
the
paper
noted
that
cbo
in
a
recent
analysis
of
the
immigration
bill
projected
that
the
us
will
have
162
million
more
people
in
2033
as
a
result
of
the
immigration
bill
than
it
would
if
congress
passed
no
changes
to
the
immigration
system
cbo
said
this
is
primarily
because
the
legislation
would
loosen
or
eliminate
annual
limits
on
various
categories
of
permanent
and
temporary
immigration
meanwhile
the
census
bureau
has
projected
that
the
us
population
on
its
own
and
in
the
absence
of
an
immigration
bill
was
already
set
to
rise
from
3163
million
in
2013
to
3653
million
in
2033
thats
an
increase
of
49
million
if
you
add
these
two
numbers
together
you
get
a
roughly
65
million
increase
in
population
thats
pretty
close
to
steins
70
million
figure
steins
comments
suggested
to
us
and
to
the
reader
who
urged
us
to
check
the
claim
that
its
the
immigration
bill
that
caused
the
70
million
increase
but
thats
not
the
case
in
reality
roughly
threequarters
of
the
65
million
population
increase
from
2013
to
2033
comes
not
from
additional
immigrants
crossing
the
border
and
having
children
on
us
soil
but
rather
from
americans
already
legally
on
us
soil
having
kids
and
from
immigrants
coming
to
the
us
legally
under
current
laws
the
senate
bill
wouldnt
affect
this
population
growth
at
all
several
population
experts
told
politifact
that
they
had
problems
with
steins
claim
i
dont
see
where
the
70
million
would
come
from
certainly
not
from
the
countries
mostly
responsible
for
undocumented
migration
said
douglas
massey
a
professor
at
princeton
universitys
office
of
population
research
together
mexico
el
salvador
guatemala
and
honduras
account
for
around
threefourths
of
all
undocumented
residents
but
the
combined
population
of
these
countries
is
only
around
150
million
so
70
million
moving
here
would
represent
47
percent
of
their
combined
population
which
is
simply
not
credible
in
an
interview
steven
a
camarota
the
author
of
the
center
for
immigration
studies
paper
declined
to
assess
the
adequacy
of
how
stein
phrased
the
statistic
however
he
said
its
not
unreasonable
to
focus
on
the
impact
of
immigration
on
the
nations
population
growth
even
if
the
number
isnt
as
high
as
70
million
the
basic
question
remains
is
16
million
additional
residents
a
lot
camarota
said
this
is
on
top
of
the
19
million
from
current
immigration
levels
the
key
question
is
what
are
the
costs
and
benefits
of
significantly
increasing
the
size
and
density
of
the
us
population
as
a
direct
result
of
federal
policy
the
country
lacks
even
a
terse
discussion
of
this
issue
our
ruling
stein
said
the
senate
immigration
bill
unleashes
a
massive
increase
in
overall
immigration
É
were
talking
about
a
population
increase
under
the
senate
bill
of
over
70
million
people
in
20
years
while
credible
estimates
do
say
the
us
population
could
grow
by
65
million
between
2013
and
2033
only
about
16
million
of
that
would
be
increases
resulting
from
the
senate
bill
the
remaining
49
million
or
threequarters
of
the
total
would
come
from
natural
population
growth
among
people
already
in
america
and
by
immigration
thats
deemed
legal
under
todays
laws
and
thus
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
senate
bill
passes
or
not
