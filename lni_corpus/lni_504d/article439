a
federal
judges
decision
to
block
several
provisions
of
south
carolinas
new
immigration
law
from
taking
effect
on
sunday
new
years
day
is
the
latest
blow
to
the
shameful
laws
passed
by
a
few
states
immigration
reform
has
to
come
from
washington
and
it
has
to
be
far
more
fair
and
responsible
than
the
punitive
laws
cracking
under
legal
challenges
us
district
judge
richard
gergel
ruled
last
thursday
that
a
number
of
aspects
of
the
law
including
a
requirement
that
law
officers
check
the
immigration
status
of
people
they
pull
over
if
they
suspect
they
are
in
the
country
illegally
and
a
section
making
it
a
crime
not
to
carry
immigration
paperwork
were
unconstitutional
because
they
usurp
washingtons
role
in
immigration
policy
that
aside
the
south
carolina
immigration
law
would
obviously
encourage
racial
profiling
thursday
was
a
busy
day
in
the
courts
regarding
immigration
as
federal
appeals
courts
denied
the
requests
by
georgia
and
alabama
that
legal
challenges
to
their
new
immigration
laws
be
delayed
until
the
us
supreme
court
rules
on
the
constitutionality
of
arizonas
immigration
law
next
year
a
federal
judge
thursday
began
hearing
arguments
in
a
lawsuit
alleging
racial
profiling
on
the
part
of
maricopa
county
arizona
sheriff
joe
arpaio
whose
immigration
patrols
have
gained
him
national
prominence
earlier
this
month
federal
officials
accused
the
sheriffs
office
of
a
wide
range
of
civil
rights
violations
court
challenges
on
a
variety
of
fronts
are
the
inevitable
outcome
of
the
passage
of
flagrantly
unconstitutional
and
unfair
immigration
laws
in
alabama
whose
particularly
horrific
law
has
hurt
the
states
economy
by
causing
immigrant
workers
including
those
here
legally
to
flee
the
state
the
attorney
general
has
asked
the
legislature
to
rescind
several
provisions
he
doesnt
believe
will
hold
up
in
federal
court
these
include
several
provisions
similar
to
those
thrown
out
last
week
in
south
carolina
along
with
a
uniquely
sinister
one
requiring
already
underfunded
schools
to
collect
immigration
data
on
parents
and
children
federal
immigration
reform
is
doable
but
must
include
establishment
of
a
route
to
citizenship
for
the
estimated
13
million
illegal
immigrants
in
the
nation
who
cannot
be
loaded
in
box
cars
with
their
innocent
children
and
dumped
south
of
the
border
because
washington
conservatives
see
this
route
to
citizenship
as
amnesty
federal
reform
is
stalled
and
the
states
are
left
to
their
own
devices
the
result
has
been
passage
of
bad
laws
that
courts
will
send
piece
by
piece
to
the
trash
heap
