just
about
every
day
immigration
lawyer
carlos
spector
gets
a
call
from
a
client
or
from
a
friend
of
a
friend
in
arizona
wanting
to
know
the
same
thing
should
i
leave
arizona
before
i
get
deported
his
patent
answer
is
maybe
questions
about
arizonas
controversial
immigration
law
have
been
coming
to
spector
almost
nonstop
since
april
when
arizona
gov
jan
brewer
signed
the
nations
toughest
illegal
immigration
law
the
bill
requires
immigrants
to
carry
proof
that
they
can
work
and
live
in
the
us
the
bill
allows
police
officers
to
detain
undocumented
immigrants
arizonas
bill
was
supposed
to
take
effect
aug
1
but
a
federal
court
has
already
halted
key
parts
of
it
spector
56
has
been
keeping
a
close
eye
on
arizona
because
he
has
been
practicing
immigration
law
for
more
than
20
years
he
got
his
law
degree
from
texas
southern
university
in
houston
he
has
a
bachelors
and
a
masters
degree
from
the
university
of
texas
at
el
paso
he
grew
up
in
the
lower
valley
and
graduated
from
bel
air
high
school
in
1972
spector
proudly
says
his
father
is
a
russian
jew
and
his
mother
is
mexican
that
makes
him
a
natural
immigration
lawyer
he
said
i
was
always
the
outsider
so
i
understand
how
these
people
feel
when
they
get
targeted
spector
said
i
was
a
jewcano
from
the
barrio
it
wasnt
easy
but
thats
what
made
me
want
to
help
people
with
their
immigration
problems
q
what
do
you
make
of
arizonas
immigration
law
and
its
future
a
its
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
this
attempt
by
arizona
to
enforce
immigration
law
is
dangerous
and
meanspirited
even
some
in
the
police
department
who
have
to
enforce
arizonas
immigration
laws
are
against
it
some
of
them
are
refusing
to
enforce
it
for
years
the
federal
government
has
tried
to
strangle
people
with
immigration
laws
by
using
one
hand
now
arizona
wants
to
strangle
immigrants
with
two
hands
q
a
federal
judge
last
week
blocked
portions
of
the
bill
including
the
authority
of
police
officers
to
question
people
about
their
immigration
status
what
do
you
think
of
the
ruling
a
it
is
a
temporary
and
partial
victory
for
the
latino
community
but
we
have
to
remember
that
it
is
not
the
final
word
ultimately
i
see
this
issue
before
the
supreme
court
in
the
meantime
in
the
absence
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
we
will
see
more
and
more
states
implementing
their
own
immigration
laws
because
it
has
become
a
political
tool
people
like
to
use
immigration
issues
in
the
context
of
security
problems
but
it
is
really
a
way
to
try
to
throw
people
out
of
this
country
q
does
this
country
need
immigration
reform
a
i
basically
think
we
do
but
it
has
to
have
a
balance
between
law
enforcement
and
legalization
the
law
has
to
have
more
in
it
than
a
tool
to
throw
people
out
of
this
country
the
problem
is
that
over
the
last
20
years
all
weve
seen
when
it
comes
to
immigration
law
is
more
law
enforcement
and
more
ways
to
get
people
in
trouble
and
deported
we
have
to
restore
due
process
in
this
area
q
you
have
said
it
will
take
the
country
at
least
15
years
to
come
up
with
a
new
immigration
policy
why
so
long
a
the
first
national
debates
about
immigration
reform
began
in
1971
after
california
passed
its
own
immigration
bill
congress
began
debating
a
national
immigration
bill
after
that
but
it
took
them
until
1986
to
pass
a
bill
that
was
the
simpsonmazzoli
act
which
made
employers
check
the
immigration
status
of
employees
while
granting
amnesty
to
others
thats
15
years
it
took
three
different
major
legislation
efforts
to
get
something
done
back
then
the
process
will
take
just
as
long
this
time
q
are
there
any
positives
to
the
arizona
law
a
yes
it
is
mobilizing
people
and
groups
to
stand
together
against
what
is
happening
in
arizona
mexicanamerican
people
are
feeling
the
meanspiritedness
of
this
law
and
it
is
uniting
them
