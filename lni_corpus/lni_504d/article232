a
state
commission
studying
the
costs
and
benefits
of
immigration
to
virginia
heard
mainly
about
benefits
yesterday
at
its
first
public
hearing
where
most
speakers
exhorted
panelists
to
pursue
efforts
to
integrate
immigrants
and
shun
policies
intended
to
drive
out
illegal
immigrants
in
a
nation
that
can
afford
to
be
generous
to
the
least
of
these
too
many
people
live
in
fear
of
a
knock
on
the
door
because
they
are
of
latino
descent
front
royal
resident
tom
howarth
told
the
20member
panel
echoing
others
at
the
forum
he
said
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
treatment
of
immigrants
in
prince
william
county
about
200
people
attended
the
hearing
at
george
mason
university
it
was
the
first
of
five
hearings
to
be
held
across
the
state
by
the
virginia
commission
on
immigration
which
grew
out
of
a
bill
passed
by
the
general
assembly
last
year
the
panel
will
eventually
offer
recommendations
on
immigrationrelated
policies
to
state
and
federal
lawmakers
said
state
sen
john
c
watkins
rchesterfield
chairman
of
the
commission
it
is
one
of
a
handful
of
state
groups
formed
to
study
a
topic
that
has
seized
the
attention
of
local
officials
nationwide
as
they
grapple
with
increasingly
diverse
communities
and
public
angst
over
illegal
immigration
some
localities
such
as
prince
william
have
responded
with
controversial
crackdowns
on
illegal
immigrants
the
topic
of
yesterdays
hearing
was
the
effect
of
immigration
legal
as
well
as
illegal
on
northern
virginia
but
most
speakers
including
several
representatives
of
nonprofit
organizations
that
serve
immigrants
focused
on
a
larger
landscape
calling
for
federal
solutions
to
tensions
over
illegal
immigration
and
expanded
access
to
higher
education
for
those
in
the
country
illegally
immigrants
are
really
goodhearted
people
who
are
assets
to
our
community
said
alexandria
resident
pat
rizzuto
youve
got
to
distinguish
between
those
concerns
that
congress
must
address
comprehensive
immigration
reform
and
those
that
virginia
can
already
address
through
its
existing
laws
other
speakers
encouraged
stricter
local
crackdowns
on
illegal
immigration
which
they
said
drains
tax
dollars
contributes
to
sprawl
and
encourages
lawlessness
this
country
is
supposed
to
be
a
country
of
laws
if
we
all
obeyed
the
laws
wed
get
along
better
but
immigration
laws
have
gone
by
the
wayside

the

m
kaine
d
including
an
alexandria
police
captain
an
arlington
county
priest
and
a
virginia
beach
physician
states
and
localities
have
passed
record
numbers
of
immigrationrelated
measures
in
recent
years
an
approach
that
critics
call
piecemeal
and
divisive
but
proponents
deem
a
necessary
reaction
to
congresss
stalled
overhaul
of
immigration
laws
last
year
the
virginia
state
crime
commission
formed
a
task
force
on
illegal
immigration

illegal

crimes
over
five
meetings
since
the
fall
the
immigration
commission
has
studied
topics
such
as
federal
immigration
laws
employment
services
for
immigrants
drivers
licenses
and
hispanic
demographics
immigrants
make
up
about
10
percent
of
virginias
population
according
to
2006
census
data
the
number
of
illegal
immigrants
is
unknown
but
reports
by
the
pew
hispanic
center
and
the
center
for
immigration
studies
estimate
it
at
3
percent
of
virginias
population
at
yesterdays
hearing
several
speakers
told
personal
stories
of
illegal
immigrants
themselves
in
some
cases
or
people
they
knew
among
them

noelia
olivera
a
george
mason

said
she
recently

asked
by

young
cousin
why
