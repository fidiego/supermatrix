some
observers
believe
the
passage
of
the
immigration
reform
bill
wont
accomplish
much
in
the
shortterm
what
are
your
thoughts
a
the
bill
in
its
current
form
would
immediately
increase
visa
numbers
for
highly
talented
foreign
nationals
with
us
degrees
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
these
stemdegreed
foreign
nationals
immediately
would
aid
us
companies
in
their
pursuits
to
develop
advanced
technologies
needed
to
strengthen
our
economy
and
to
compete
with
other
nations
that
have
surged
ahead
of
the
us
in
the
last
several
years
the
bill
would
allow
11
million
undocumented
aliens
to
legally
enter
the
us
workforce
by
becoming
current
on
all
back
taxes
and
paying
substantial
fines
necessary
to
obtain
registered
provisional
immigrant
status
rpi
and
after
waiting
10
years
apply
for
lawful
resident
alien
status
and
ultimately
seek
us
citizenship
these
workers
immediately
would
help
alleviate
unmet
needs
in
the
hotel
and
restaurant
agriculture
oil
and
gas
construction
and
other
sectors
that
rely
heavily
on
unskilled
and
semiskilled
labor
for
seasonal
and
temporary
positions
in
exchange
those
who
pressed
for
enhanced
border
security
eliminating
federal
benefits
to
the
undocumented
and
further
restricting
familybased
sponsorship
will
see
the
availability
of
20000
additional
border
patrol
officers
everify
for
all
workers
and
the
inability
of
registered
provisional
immigrants
to
obtain
medicare
food
stamps
and
other
federal
benefits
q
what
obstacles
have
yet
to
be
cleared
and
why
a
the
legislation
as
passed
in
the
senate
bill
essentially
provides
the
border
protections
and
other
restrictions
set
out
by
opposition
groups
as
a
requirement
for
passage
now
legislation
must
pass
the
house
of
representatives
the
house
isnt
as
far
along
as
the
senate
but
is
making
progress
toward
some
type
of
immigration
reform
the
chair
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
bob
goodlatte
rva
has
introduced
a
number
of
bills
that
deal
with
individual
pieces
of
reform
and
the
committee
began
markup
of
those
bills
the
week
of
june
17
the
house
bipartisan
gang
of
eight
is
now
the
gang
of
seven
as
rep
raul
labrador
rida
has
officially
left
the
group
the
gang
of
seven
has
indicated
they
will
be
introducing
its
own
version
of
a
comprehensive
bill
but
that
path
is
still
unclear
house
speaker
john
boehner
stated
just
a
few
weeks
ago
that
reforming
our
immigration
system
is
an
important
project
of
this
congress
weve
got
big
problems
and
theyve
gone
on
far
too
long
and
its
time
for
us
to
address
them
immigration
reform
will
either
pass
or
fail
with
john
boehner
and
boehner
has
indicated
he
may
implement
the
hastert
rule
which
will
preclude
a
vote
on
immigration
reform
unless
51
percent
of
the
republican
members
of
the
house
support
it
many
believe
there
is
a
sufficient
number
of
democrats
and
republicans
who
would
support
and
pass
immigration
reform
in
the
house
one
of
the
main
hurdles
is
many
republicans
agree
with
the
enhanced
border
security
provisions
but
some
are
opposed
to
any
path
to
citizenship
for
those
granted
registered
provisional
immigration
status
q
you
recently
were
elected
american
immigration
lawyers
association
aila
president
what
will
your
duties
entail
a
aila
is
a
13000member
worldwide
association
of
immigration
lawyers
established
to
promote
justice
advocate
for
fair
and
reasonable
american
immigration
law
and
policy
and
advance
the
quality
of
immigration
and
nationality
law
and
practice
one
of
my
immediate
strategic
goals
is
to
increase
member
participation
in
advocacy
before
congress
the
judiciary
the
federal
agencies
and
the
media
for
immigrationrelated
interests
of
our
clients
and
society
i
also
plan
to
implement
more
programs
to
educate
the
public
on
the
ways
in
which
us
immigration
law
and
policy
serves
the
national
interest
by
providing
us
employers
with
the
specialized
skills
they
need
to
remain
globally
competitive
and
reuniting
american
families
i
also
see
a
need
to
enhance
the
litigation
capabilities
of
our
membership
as
an
important
option
to
ensure
the
just
administration
of
our
immigration
laws
