one
cant
help
but
marvel
at
the
rhetorical
skills
of
the
antiimmigrant
crowd
take
project
usa
an
advocacy
group
that
never
misses
a
chance
to
label
itself
moderate
it
advocates
ending
illegal
immigration
an
unexceptionable
moderate
position
who
is
for
illegal
immigration
anyway
but
project
usa
also
favors
a
ten
year
timeout
while
the
country
reassesses
immigration
in
terms
of
the
longterm
consequences
of
present
policy
so
a
decadelong
ban
on
legal
immigration
is
presented
as
a
moderate
position
dazzling
also
aweinspiring
is
rep
tom
tancredo
the
colorado
republican
who
is
one
of
the
houses
most
vocal
critics
of
illegal
immigration
last
november
he
was
so
thoroughly
impressed
by
an
essay
written
by
a
college
kid
that
he
inserted
it
into
the
congressional
record
goes
the
essay
the
economic
social
and
political
results
of
illegal
immigration
in
particular
the
unique
issues
and
problems
posed
by
contemporary
hispanic
immigration
are
detrimental
to
the
united
states
and
opponents
of
mexican
illegal
immigration
believe
that
even
though
the
united
states
was
founded
by
immigrants
immigration
of
the
past
is
not
the
same
as
it
is
today
first
mexican
immigrants
are
not
here
legally
the
insightful
reader
will
note
that
the
first
quote
starts
off
warning
of
problems
posed
by
illegal
immigration
and
ends
up
with
handwringing
about
contemporary
hispanic
immigration
never
mind
the
illegal
part
note
too
that
the
second
quote
clearly
states
that
all
mexican
immigrants
are
illegal
does
tancredo
really
agree
with
that
what
is
the
problem
for
him
illegal
immigration
or
too
many
hispanic
immigrants
ah
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
most
people
wont
notice
the
slipperiness
of
the
argument
illegal
immigrants
hispanic
immigrants
whats
the
difference
both
are
bad
for
the
us
of
a
rhetoric
like
that
ought
to
make
every
fairminded
american
skeptical
about
any
proposal
that
comes
from
that
side
of
the
immigration
issue
immigration
is
not
a
problem
illegal
immigration
is
and
the
problem
of
illegal
immigration
is
nothing
compared
with
the
problem
of
terrorism
on
american
soil
which
is
why
the
most
urgent
reason
for
immigration
reform
by
far
is
to
stop
people
who
want
to
blow
us
up
not
people
who
want
to
wash
our
dishes
or
mow
our
lawns
every
year
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
enter
undetected
through
the
mexican
and
canadian
borders
how
difficult
can
it
be
for
five
or
six
terrorists
use
your
brain
the
brain
tells
us
we
need
much
stronger
security
at
the
borders
more
border
patrol
officers
and
yes
build
the
wall
most
liberals
will
cringe
but
if
keeping
terrorists
out
means
it
will
be
harder
for
wellmeaning
illegal
immigrants
to
get
in
thats
too
bad
for
wellmeaning
illegal
immigrants
there
might
also
be
complaints
from
people
in
border
towns
worried
that
a
wall
will
deter
lawful
trade
but
the
roads
on
which
international
commerce
travels
obviously
will
not
be
walled
off
but
using
the
brain
is
not
enough
immigration
reformers
must
also
listen
to
their
heart
yes
as
a
matter
of
security
policy
we
must
stop
terrorists
from
sneaking
in
yes
as
a
matter
of
immigration
policy
we
should
stop
illegal
immigrants
from
sneaking
in
but
what
to
do
about
the
millions
already
here
the
bush
administration
has
the
right
idea
the
amnesty
that
dare
not
speak
its
name
well
let
them
call
it
what
they
want
under
the
bush
plan
illegal
immigrants
who
have
been
here
for
a
certain
number
of
years
will
be
able
to
register
with
the
government
and
be
temporarily
allowed
to
stay
in
the
united
states
pending
a
review
of
their
case
that
might
eventually
result
in
a
green
card
and
later
citizenship
although
the
idea
originates
in
the
compassionate
heart
it
is
not
at
odds
with
the
logic
of
the
brain
the
more
illegal
immigrants
come
to
light
the
easier
to
find
terrorists
lurking
among
them
besides
the
only
other
option
is
a
forcible
mass
deportation
of
people
who
entered
illegally
20
years
ago
worked
hard
raised
an
american
family
and
stayed
out
of
trouble
and
who
has
the
stomach
for
that
