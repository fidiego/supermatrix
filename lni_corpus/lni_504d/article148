security
in
a
press
conference
in
washington
on

ice
an

ice
deported
389834
people
of
whom
about
35
percent
or
136000
were

homeland
security
secretary
janet
napolitano
said
the
rise
in
deportations
of
criminals
reflected
an
obama
administration
decision
to
put
greater
focus
on
removing
illegal
immigrants
who
pose
a
threat
to
public
safety
in
recent
years
immigration
advocates
had
complained
that
immigration
officials
were
using
congressionally
funded
programs
aimed
at
arresting
and
deporting
dangerous
criminals
and
possible
terrorists
to
instead
round
up
people
with
civil
immigration
violations
napolitano
said
that
the
shift
in
immigration
enforcement
also
included
a
more
aggressive
crackdown
on
employers
who
knowingly
hire
illegal
workers
and
those
who
game
the
system
but
to
achieve
the
most
effective
immigration
control
she
said
it
is
crucial
that
congress
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
legislation
we
know
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
congress
must
make
changes
she
said
the
laws
we
have
are
simply
not
sufficient
to
meet
21stcentury
demands
the
administration
stands
ready
to
work
with
members
of
congress
of
both
parties
activists
on
opposing
sides
of
the
immigration
issue
criticized
immigration
officials
characterization
of
the
statistics
as
evidence
that
they
are
tackling
immigration
successfully
those
who
prefer
a
hard
line
on
immigration
said
that
the
obama
administration
was
trying
to
portray
itself
as
tough
on
immigration
while
it
fights
attempts
by
states
such
as
arizona
to
tackle
illegal
immigration
on
their
own
thats
a
ying
and
yang
that
doesnt
make
sense
said
ron
bass
founder
of
the
lindenbased
group
united
patriots
of
america
those
who
want
the
united
states
to
ease
immigration
restrictions
and
offer
illegal
immigrants
opportunities
to
legalize
their
status
assailed
napolitano
and
ice
officials
for
emphasizing
statistics
as
a
measure
of
success
that
press
conference
speaks
to
the
problems
weve
seen
with
ice
said
amy
gottlieb
of
american
friends
service
committee
theyre
working
with
quotas
and
not
paying
attention
to
who
theyre
deporting
and
the
consequences
of
separating
families
theyre
totally
dehumanizing
the
reality
of
immigration
