the
denver
post
is
asking
colorados
three
gubernatorial
candidates
to
respond
to
a
series
of
questions
on
some
critical
issues
this
week
they
were
asked
to
respond
to
this
question
on
immigration
would
you
support
an
arizonatype
immigration
law
in
colorado
if

federal
reform
a
must
by
john
hickenlooper
i
understand
the
frustration
so
many
people
in
colorado
feel
because
of
the
federal
governments
failure
to
act
on
this
issue
concern
over
immigration
is
dividing
our
country
its
a
problem
we
must
solve
yet
congress
has
failed
to
act
because
politicians
on
both
sides
republicans
and
democrats
think
they
have
something
to
gain
form
perpetuating
immigration
as
a
wedge
issue
but
individual
state
or
local
policies
will
never
be
a
substitute
for
comprehensive
bipartisan
federal
reform
the
arizona
association
of
chiefs
of
police
opposed
arizonas
law
out
of
concern
for
the
costs
and
public
safety
a
law
like
arizonas
would
mean
skyrocketing
costs
for
local
law
enforcement
agencies
courts
prisons
and
ultimately
colorado
taxpayers
im
not
inclined
to
place
another
unfunded
mandate
on
our
local
communities
for
a
problem
that
should
be
solved
by
the
federal
government
instead
i
would
work
with
governors
across
the
country
to
form
a
coalition
demanding
federal
immigration
reform
most
of
us
already
agree
on
four
basic
tenets
of
a
sound
immigration
policy
we
need
to
secure
our
borders
we
need
an
identification
system
that
is
reliable
and
secure
we
need
a
guestworker
program
to
protect
our
farmers
ranchers
and
other
industries
and
we
need
to
hold
businesses
accountable
and
responsible
once
these
measures
are
in
place
colorado
already
has
some
of
the
nations
toughest
immigration
laws
unlike
arizonas
law
parts
of
which
were
struck
down
colorados
immigration
laws
have
not
been
challenged
in
court
in
2006
our
legislature
led
by
a
bipartisan
coalition
required
local
law
enforcement
officials
to
support
federal
immigration
authorities
when
illegal
immigrants
are
arrested
for
criminal
activity
or
jailed
under
my
administration
denver
has
twice
officially
certified
to
the
state
that
it
is
in
compliance
with
the
law
if
elected
governor
i
would
continue
to
ensure
compliance
with
all
of
these
laws
i
support
participating
in
the
secure
communities
initiative
which
takes
fingerprints
from
anyone
booked
into
jail
and
runs
them
against
fbi
and
homeland
security
records
we
need
to
identify
arrest
and
deport
dangerous
criminals
who
are
here
illegally
finally
because
some
people
will
always
play
political
games
with
a
wedge
issue
ill
give
you
the
facts
about
my
record
objective
sources
have
repeatedly
found
that
denver
follows
colorados
tough
immigration
law
the
citys
law
enforcement
agencies
have
reported
more
than
7300
arrestees
to
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
since
2006
facts
like
that
are
why
the
denver
post
recently
wrote
denvers
no
sanctuary
city
say
no
to
amesty
dan
maes
for
too
long
washington
has
sat
on
its
hands
as
neither
political
party
has
been
willing
to
make
the
tough
choices
when
it
comes
to
illegal
immigration
the
influx
of
illegal
immigrants
has
taken
a
massive
toll
on
our
state
services
and
its
time
we
get
serious
about
taking
it
on
and
that
includes
saying
no
to
amnesty
federal
inaction
has
led
to
great
consternation
among
many
across
this
state
and
nation
and
the
arizona
immigration
law
is
a
natural
extension
of
that
anger
and
frustration
while
the
law
isnt
perfect
it
does
offer
law
enforcement
some
additional
tools
to
help
enforce
immigration
laws
and
for
that
reason
i
absolutely
support
something
similar
here
in
the
centennial
state
additionally
i
support
the
secure
communities
program
a
national
initiative
that
helps
to
bridge
some
of
the
gaps
in
immigration
enforcement
through
information
sharing
and
digital
recordkeeping
at
its
core
the
program
seeks
to
deport
immigrants
who
commit
crimes
as
quickly
and
efficiently
as
possible
regardless
of
our
individual
feelings
on
immigration
certainly
removing
criminal
immigrants
is
something
everyone
can
agree
is
a
priority
but
as
much
as
those
laws
and
programs
could
help
stem
the
tide
of
illegal
immigration
the
most
important
step
we
should
take
is
perhaps
the
easiest
if
we
can
prevent
employers
from
hiring
immigrants
we
cut
off
demand
and
help
to
end
illegal
immigration
at
its
roots
everify
is
a
free
service
that
businesses
can
use
to
make
certain
theyre
hiring
legal
workers
and
we
need
to
take
a
serious
look
at
implementing
it
statewide
everify
has
already
done
wonders
in
state
government
and
at
the
municipal
levels
and
a
broadbased
expansion
would
be
cheap
effective
and
entirely
feasible
our
social
services
and
education
system
are
nearing
a
breaking
point
and
theres
no
question
illegal
immigration
is
much
to
blame
with
the
coming
wave
of
new
conservative
leadership
in
washington
there
is
renewed
hope
for
a
positive
antiamnesty
solution
at
the
federal
level
but
until
the
feds
take
meaningful
action
states
need
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
address
the
issue
locally
through
everify
programs
like
secure
communities
and
new
tougher
laws
colorado
can
take
three
very
important
steps
in
that
direction
ariztype
laws
work
tom
tancredo
yes
i
strongly
support
arizonastyle
laws
to
deal
with
a
problem
created
by
the
federal
governments
lack
of
enforcement
of
our
nations
immigration
laws
colorado
has
an
estimated
200000
or
more
illegal
immigrants
who
drain
over
16
billion
in
taxpayer
dollars
annually
according
to
a
recent
study
by
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
colorado
spends
over
50
million
alone
on
prosecuting
and
incarcerating
criminal
immigrants
beginning
in
2004
arizona
enacted
a
series
of
referenda
and
state
laws
on
this
matter
and
sb
1070
is
only
the
most
recent
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
new
arizona
law
has
been
put
on
hold
by
a
federal
district
judge
but
many
legal
experts
say
it
will
ultimately
be
upheld
in
fact
coloradobased
mountain
states
legal
foundation
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
it
that
provision
makes
it
a
state
crime
to
be
in
arizona
unlawfully
and
gives
local
law
enforcement
the
authority
to
ask
for
the
same
immigration
documents
that
are
already
required
by
federal
law
arizonas
new
sb
1070
law
contains
one
provision
already
enacted
in
colorado
in
2006
a
law
prohibiting
sanctuary
city
policies
however
that
colorado
statute
sb
06090
needs
to
be
more
vigorously
enforced
denver
for
example
has
not
lost
one
dollar
of
state
funding
for
its
failure
to
enforce
the
law
despite
its
police
training
bulletin
of
september
2006
basically
telling
denver
police
officers
they
can
ignore
it
working
with
the
general
assembly
i
will
support
strong
enforcement
of
existing
laws
aimed
at
illegal
immigrants
and
will
sign
new
legislation
on
the
arizona
model
if
passed
by
the
legislature
moreover
i
will
ask
other
governors
across
the
nation
republican
and
democrat
to
join
me
in
demanding
federal
enforcement
of
our
immigration
laws
and
immediate
action
to
secure
our
borders
