flight
attendants
who
were
told
last
week
to
return
to
poland
because
their
visas
had
been
issued
by
mistake
can
stay
in
new
york
while
the
airline
appeals
the
decision
officials
said
yesterday
the
announcement
gives
at
least
a
temporary
reprieve
to
the
flight
attendants
who
last
summer
accepted
deltas
offer
to
transfer
to
new
york
after
the
airline
closed
its
base
of
operations
in
warsaw
many
had
sold
homes
and
cars
and
had
uprooted
families
for
the
chance
to
work
in
the
united
states
both
immigration
officials
and
airline
executives
said
last
week
that
the
attendants
would
have
to
leave
the
country
by
dec
5
after
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
ruled
that
they
should
not
have
been
granted
special
visas
to
work
for
delta
in
new
york
the
airline
said
it
had
exhausted
its
appeals
and
the
federal
agency
said
it
had
no
choice
under
the
law
but
to
demand
that
the
workers
depart
but
yesterday
immigration
officials
said
the
airline
could
appeal
the
decision
and
the
workers
could
stay
while
the
appeal
was
considered
which
could
take
up
to
a
year
that
announcement
came
after
the
workers
had
retained
an
immigration
lawyer
michael
j
wildes
to
press
their
case
and
their
plight
was
described
in
an
article
last
week
in
the
new
york
times
elected
officials
and
others
expressed
dismay
over
the
agencys
handling
of
the
case
senator
alfonse
m
damato
for
example
wrote
to
doris
m
meissner
the
commissioner
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
urging
her
to
find
a
way
to
allow
the
attendants
to
stay
immigration
officials
said
yesterday
that
the
airline
had
failed
to
take
additional
steps
to
appeal
the
decision
barring
the
workers
russell
a
bergeron
jr
a
spokesman
for
the
immigration
service
in
washington
said
that
correspondence
sent
to
delta
clearly
stated
that
it
had
the
right
to
appeal
the
decision
formally
if
there
was
no
appeal
filed
by
dec
5
then
they
would
have
had
to
leave
mr
bergeron
said
but
delta
executives
said
they
had
been
led
to
believe
there
was
nothing
further
they
could
do
we
thought
our
original
application
was
complete
we
thought
all
the
is
were
dotted
and
the
ts
were
crossed
said
kimberly
king
a
spokeswoman
for
delta
in
atlanta
neither
immigration
officials
nor
executives
for
the
airline
would
speculate
on
what
the
outcome
of
the
appeal
might
be
but
mr
wildes
has
said
he
would
argue
that
the
workers
were
entitled
to
the
visas
and
that
the
immigration
service
was
wrong
to
revoke
them
the
visas
involved
called
intracompany
transfer
visas
are
usually
issued
to
managers
or
to
employees
with
special
knowledge
of
a
company
immigration
officials
said
an
immigration
examiner
at
a
regional
office
in
vermont
had
been
wrong
to
approve
the
visas
for
the
delta
workers
because
flight
attendants
did
not
qualify
for
the
special
status
the
mistake
was
discovered
in
september
by
an
immigration
official
at
kennedy
international
airport
who
was
surprised
to
see
a
flight
attendant
with
the
special
visa
and
checked
with
his
superiors
mr
bergeron
defended
the
agencys
ruling
that
the
flight
attendants
had
to
leave
the
country
once
we
discovered
that
an
error
in
judgment
had
been
made
he
said
we
had
an
obligation
to
set
the
record
straight
because
these
determinations
form
the
basis
for
future
decisions
in
a
case
that
has
been
beset
by
problems
from
the
beginning
the
workers
are
now
wondering
whom
they
can
trust
i
wonder
how
can
you
rely
on
a
company
that
says
we
are
out
and
then
we
are
in
said
slawek
bardski
a
flight
attendant
whose
wife
is
expecting
a
child
we
are
pleased
but
at
the
same
time
we
dont
feel
any
security
