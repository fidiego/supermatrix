republicans
open
their
bid
to
overhaul
the

immigration
system
by
giving
local

officers
more
authority
to
enforce

rep
bob
goodlatte
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
expected
to
hurl
a
brushback
pitch
to
congressional
democrats
on
tuesday
when
his
committee
takes
up
a
tough
immigration
enforcement
measure
as
the
houses
first
official
step
toward
immigration
reform
specifically
the
measure
would
empower
state
and
local
governments
to
take
part
in
enforcing
federal
immigration
law
and
it
is
expected
to
pass
why
is
representative
goodlatte
taking
a
step
that
many
democrats
on
his
committee
and
immigration
advocates
see
as
provocative
just
like
a
fastball
high
and
inside
its
about
sending
a
signal
enforcing
immigration
laws
in
americas
interior
is
the
place
where
we
think
the
senate
bill
is
absolutely
the
weakest
and
it
is
the
place
where
in
1986
there
was
an
easy
pathway
to
citizenship
for
3
million
people
and
then
enforcement
never
really
happened
says
goodlatte
referring
to
the
last
year
in
which
congress
approved
comprehensive
immigration
reform
legislation
we
hope
this
topic
will
be
highlighted
because
we
think
its
been
neglected
in
other
places
he
adds
while
tuesdays
first
pitch
is
hard
to
handle
and
is
generating
a
storm
of
vituperation
from
the
left
goodlatte
says
republicans
arent
singularly
interested
in
hardball
in
fact
in
the
weeks
to
come
goodlatte
plans
to
move
a
bill
offering
a
way
for
some
11
million
undocumented
people
already
in
the
us
to
become
permanent
residents
and
citizens
a
central
component
for
immigration
reform
for
his
democratic
colleagues
in
the
senates
comprehensive
reform
bill
a
nationwide
everify
system
for
determining
a
prospective
employees
true
identity
is
the
main
interior
enforcement
measure
by
contrast
the
house
safe
act
cosponsored
by
goodlatte
and
rep
trey
gowdy
r
of
south
carolina
will
allow
state
and
local
public
safety
authorities
to
take
on
some
immigrationenforcement
roles
other
provisions
include
beefing
up
the
weapons
and
body
armor
available
to
some
federal
immigration
enforcers
the
legislation
will
be
amended
and
probably
approve
on
tuesday
morning
in
a
panel
that
tilts
heavily
toward
republicans
thats
the
controversial
approach
that
had
hardedged
application
by
state
governments
such
as
arizonas
the
states
immigration
law
known
as
sb
1070
was
struck
down
in
part
by
the
us
supreme
court
last
year
because
it
attempted
to
overstep
federal
immigration
authority
gop
presidential
contender
mitt
romney
endorsed
the
arizona
law
as
a
model
for
national
immigration
policy
and
was
summarily
walloped
by
president
obama
among
hispanic
voters
goodlatte
says
he
understands
the
passions
such
proposals
stir
in
democrats
but
that
avoiding
a
repetition
of
the
1986
immigration
amnesty
burns
just
as
hot
for
republicans
whereas
democrats
and
immigrant
advocates
see
the
house
bill
as
a
backtothefuture
moment
for
republican
politics
goodlatte
sees
delegating
some
enforcement
authority
away
from
the
federal
government
as
a
check
on
future
presidents
of
either
party
if
were
going
to
have
meaningful
immigration
reform
its
got
to
include
a
strong
enforcement
component
that
doesnt
allow
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
ability
to
flip
a
switch
and
say
were
not
going
to
enforce
this
or
that
area
of
immigration
law
he
says
will
goodlattes
pitch
empty
the
proverbial
benches
for
an
allout
brawl
no
punches
are
being
thrown
yet
but
democrats
and
immigration
reform
advocates
are
snarling
at
the
lip
of
the
dugout
some
advocates
say
republicans
just
didnt
learn
their
lesson
from
the
2012
election
with
simon
rosenberg
founder
of
the
new
democratic
network
calling
the
house
bill
an
ideological
necessity
for
those
on
the
right
who
are
fighting
to
rebuild
mr
romneys
immigration
strategy
of
selfdeportation
from
the
ashes
of
its
charring
at
the
supreme
court
and
at
the
ballot
box
some
say
republicans
are
simply
staking
out
a
position
for
maximum
negotiating
leverage
if
or
when
both
chambers
pass
immigration
legislation
i
understand
the
political
fallout
from
the
immigration
reform
debate
that
some
of
these
folks
feel
like
they
need
cover
said
tony
martinez
mayor
of
brownsville
texas
a
city
near
the
usmexico
border
in
a
conference
call
with
reporters
on
monday
i
certainly
understand
the
political
aspect
of
it
thats
fine
get
it
out
there
i
dont
think
its
going
anywhere
but
what
really
concerns
democrats
is
that
the
first
bill
may
be
a
sign
of
things
to
come
that
is
of
a
house
gop
majority
interested
only
in
moving
measures
that
are
anathema
to
the
left
and
that
are
aimed
at
blowing
up
the
fragile
bipartisan
d√©tente
over
immigration
issues
on
capitol
hill
the
approach
this
bill
takes
is
dangerous
and
wrong
and
i
hope
todays
hearing
is
not
a
sign
of
the
direction
in
which
this
committee
is
heading
said
rep
zoe
lofgren
d
of
california
one
of
seven
lawmakers
engaged
in
a
bipartisan
effort
to
craft
a
comprehensive
immigration
fix
in
the
house
at
a
hearing
on
the
bill
last
week
on
monday
goodlatte
said
fears
that
the
immigration
process
is
heading
in
a
partisan
direction
are
misguided
having
already
written
bills
on
many
of
the
major
pieces
of
immigration
reform
through
standalone
measures
everify
border
security
agricultural
workers
highskilled
workers
goodlatte
says
several
more
bills
are
in
the
works
and
will
pass
through
his
committee
in
weeks
to
come
the
next
batch
of
bills
will
include
one
to
provide
a
framework
for
legalizing
the
nations
11
million
undocumented
residents
he
says
goodlatte
who
believes
that
such
a
framework
could
end
in
citizenship
for
some
of
the
undocumented
says
hes
looking
to
representative
lofgrens
bipartisan
working
group
of
seven
lawmakers
to
help
strike
the
balance
on
a
pathway
to
citizenship
but
without
an
agreement
from
the
bipartisan
house
immigration
group
which
has
neither
broken
up
nor
yet
produced
a
final
bill
despite
hints
of
either
outcome
for
several
weeks
goodlatte
is
left
waiting
we
dont
have
the
vehicle
to
move
forward
with
he
says
whatever
happens
with
the
bipartisan
group
however
he
says
he
will
eventually
find
a
legislative
ride
for
the
path
to
citizenship
you
cant
win
after
all
throwing
only
high
and
inside
we
are
definitely
interested
in
addressing
that
area
as
well
because
we
dont
think
that
the
interior
enforcement
provisions
that
were
working
on
in
this
bill
given
the
democrats
resistance
to
them
are
likely
to
become
law
unless
they
are
a
part
of
a
larger
overall
agreement
goodlatte
says
thats
been
the
plan
from
the
outset
but
exactly
how
the
pieces
will
fit
together
is
still
not
known
