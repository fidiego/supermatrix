caucus
chc
plan
to
create
a
task
force
to
study
immigration
issues
and
provide
information
about
the
impact
of
immigration
reform
on
the
black
and
hispanic
communities
the
cbc
last
week
invited
rep
luis
gutierrez
dill
chairman
of
the
chcs
immigration
task
force
to
speak
about
immigration
reform
at
the
groups
weekly
meeting
the
small
task
force
will
include
three
yettobenamed
members
from
each
caucus
having
a
more
indepth
conversation
is
a
good
idea
gutierrez
said
the
task
force
is
designed
to
help
the
two
groups
coordinate
efforts
to
pass
an
immigration
reform
bill
while
opponents
of
immigration
reform
attempt
to
stir
up
antiimmigration
sentiment
among
black
americans
a
recent
survey
by
the
university
of
chicagos
center
for
the
study
of
race
politics
and
culture
found
that
48
percent
of
black
young
adults
agreed
that
the
government
treats
most
immigrants
better
than
it
treats
most
black
people
in
this
country
at
least
one
pressure
group
the
coalition
for
the
future
of
the
american
worker
is
trying
to
capitalize
on
that
sentiment
by
running
fullpage
advertisements
in
the
washington
post
and
roll
call
featuring
a
black
man
the
advertisement
reads
amnesty
for
illegal
workers
is
not
just
a
slap
in
the
face
to
black
americans
its
an
economic
disaster
its
an
obnoxious
ad
rep
artur
davis
dala
said
when
asked
about
it
t
willard
fair
a
selfdescribed
civil
rights
advocate
who
resides
in
miami
founded
the
group
we
need
to
give
the
issue
some
real
attention
were
impacted
but
not
involved
in
it
he
said
adding
that
illegal
immigration
is
harmful
to
black
americans
simply
because
of
where
we
are
positioned
in
the
socioeconomic
structure
in
america
some
black
lawmakers
are
concerned
about
the
prevalence
of
antiimmigration
attitudes
within
the
black
community
and
the
potential
impact
on
immigration
reform
legislation
i
do
worry
i
encounter
antiimmigration
sentiment
from
progressives
antidiscrimination
advocates
davis
said
a
point
i
make
is
that
every
20
or
30
years
there
is
a
fight
over
immigration
the
proimmigration
faction
ends
up
winning
he
added
that
the
meanspirited
faction
is
not
helpful
because
one
day
it
is
immigrants
being
attacked
the
next
week
it
could
be
black
americans
black
lawmakers
said
the
antiimmigration
sentiment
stems
from
a
lack
of
economic
opportunity
and
a
history
of
discrimination
rep
john
lewis
dga
agreed
that
an
antiimmigration
perception
did
exist
but
said
it
was
a
false
perception
that
theres
still
discrimination
and
less
discrimination
against
other
people
of
color
the
cbc
chairwoman
rep
carolyn
kilpatrick
dmich
said
it
is
a
problem
were
losing
jobs
theres
a
lack
of
opportunity
and
access
the
schools
are
not
as
good
they
live
it
every
day
antiimmigration
perceptions
are
by
no
means
widespread
within
the
black
community
polling
conducted
by
the
gopleaning
tarrance

and
democraticleaning
lake

for
the
national
immigration

that
more
than
70
percent
of
white
black
and
hispanic
voters
equally
favor
immigration
reform
the
national
immigration
forums

also
showed
that
if
immigration
reform
does
not
pass
16
percent
of
voters
would
blame
congressional
democrats
and
12
percent
would
fault
