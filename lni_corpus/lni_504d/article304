you
cant
track
the
immigration
debate
without
a
scorecard
every
week
lawmakers
introduce
their
latest
bid
to
reform
immigration
and
improve
border
security
the
names
alone
give
their
flavor
the
right
act
which
stands
for
reducing
immigration
to
a
genuinely
healthy
total
the
secure
our
nations
interior
act
the
enforcement
first
immigration
reform
act
the
secure
america
and
orderly
immigration
act
and
so
on
but
while
its
easy
to
write
an
immigration
bill
and
give
it
a
stern
name
its
awfully
hard
to
pass
one
that
will
be
the
real
challenge
confronting
congress
this
year
and
as
gov
tim
pawlenty
has
shown
in
minnesota
state
governments
are
starting
to
weigh
in
too
congress
last
seriously
revised
immigration
laws
in
1996
but
rep
gil
gutknecht
rminn
is
optimistic
about
this
year
its
certainly
boiling
up
said
gutknecht
who
on
dec
29
held
a
public
forum
on
immigration
in
worthington
minn
he
added
congress
is
generally
very
slow
to
get
the
message
but
they
are
getting
the
message
now
border
security
and
immigration
reform
present
two
related
but
distinguishable
problems
facing
congress
so
far
border
security
the
get
tough
part
of
the
equation
is
moving
more
quickly
immigration
reform
the
get
legal
part
comes
next
whether
lawmakers
connect
them
in
the
end
or
keep
them
separated
is
just
one
of
the
tactical
questions
now
in
play
on
dec
16
after
two
days
of
debate
the
house
by
a
239182
margin
approved
a
multibilliondollar
border
security
bill
naturally
it
has
a
compelling
name
spelled
out
in
a
480page
committee
report
the
border
protection
antiterrorism
and
illegal
immigration
control
act
includes
the
reinforcements
penalties
and
fences
that
are
typically
the
backbone
of
border
bills
the
bill
still
needs
senate
approval
the
reinforcements
include
a
25
percent
increase
in
the
number
of
border
canine
teams
the
penalties
include
a
new
felony
crime
called
illegal
presence
in
the
united
states
potentially
covering
some
11
million
illegal
immigrants
the
multilayered
fence
would
span
700
miles
along
the
usmexican
border
loaded
with
cameras
lights
and
sensors
it
would
cost
upward
of
22
billion
beyond
controlling
borders
the
next
task
for
congress
is
reforming
immigration
more
broadly
while
specifics
vary
this
includes
taking
care
of
the
agricultural
industrys
demands
for
a
legal
and
plentiful
workforce
and
resolving
the
fate
of
the
estimated
11
million
illegal
immigrants
now
in
this
country
gutknecht
called
the
border
security
bill
a
very
important
first
step
a
coalition
of
twin
cities
groups
launched
a
campaign
recently
to
urge
minnesotas
two
senators
mark
dayton
and
norm
coleman
to
vote
against
that
bill
when
it
hits
the
senate
floor
the
groups
support
instead
a
bill
that
centers
on
such
things
as
bringing
guest
workers
into
the
country
known
as
the
mccainkennedy
bill
at
a
forum
in
st
paul
earlier
this
month
archbishop
harry
flynn
called
the
border
security
bill
morally
unacceptable
he
said
it
would
make
it
a
crime
for
undocumented
immigrants
to
work
to
support
a
family
and
make
it
a
criminal
act
for
concerned
people
to
reach
out
to
support
these
immigrants
in
any
way
on
the
state
level
illegal
immigration
is
no
longer
an
afterthought
beyond
the
nations
southwestern
border
as
evidenced
by
the
proposals
set
forth
by
pawlenty
and
recent
actions
in
other
states
ann
morse
director
of
the
immigration
policy
project
at
the
bipartisan
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
said
pawlenty
is
treading
on
new
ground
for
a
governor
other
than
new
mexico
gov
bill
richardson
and
arizona
gov
janet
napolitano
declaring
states
of
emergency
last
year
morse
said
i
havent
seen
a
response
at
the
governors
level
related
to
illegal
immigration
but
state
legislatures
are
acting
morses
organization
reports
that
they
considered
almost
300
immigration
measures
in
the
first
six
months
of
2005
36
became
law
it
lists
immigration
as
one
of
the
top
10
issues
facing
state
legislators
in
2006
said
morse
states
are
trying
to
find
out
what
can
they
do
to
deter
employers
from
hiring
illegals
what
can
they
do
to
cooperate
with
federal
government
and
law
enforcement
what
kind
of
deterrents
might
there
be
in
terms
of
public
benefits
