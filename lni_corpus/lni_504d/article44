industry
and
numerous
other
socialjustice
groups
to
advocate
for

lgbt

an
lgbt
issue
while

supreme
courts
june
decision

repeal
section
3
of
the
defense
of

act
or
doma
provided

for

tens
of
thousands
of
lgbt
immigrants
are
still
in

of
relief
a

by
the

estimates
that
there
are
more
than
267000
adults
in
the
united
states
living
at
the
intersection
of
two
marginalized
groupsthe
lgbt
population
and

work
on

of
this
vulnerable
group
below
are
three
lgbt
organizations
that
are
supporting
nationwide
bipartisan
efforts
in
the
fight
for
immigration
reform
national
center
for
transgender
equality
transgender
immigrants
face
numerous
kinds
of
discrimination
under
our
nations
current
immigration
system
in
immigration
detention
facilities
for
example
transgender
detainees
are
routinely
denied
access
to
hormone
treatment
subjected
to
abuse
and
discrimination
from
guards
and
fellow
detainees
and
often
placed
in
solitary
confinement
in
a
misguided
effort
to
separate
them
from
the
general
detainee
population
and
protect
them
from
abuse
moreover
transgender
asylum
applicants
also
face
challenges
in
the
asylum
system
for
one
thing
they
are
at
risk
of
having
their
cases
dismissed
if
they
do
not
conform
to
stereotypes
of
how
transgender
people
look
or
behave
they
are
also
at
risk
of
being
ineligible
for
asylum
because
of
the
oneyear
filing
deadline
while
many
people
are
familiar
with
political
asylum
many
individuals
do
not
know
that
fear
of
persecution
on
the
basis
of
gender
identity
is
grounds
for
asylum
in
the
united
states
and
they
may
not
learn
this
within
a
year
of
their
arrival
in
light
of
the
mistreatment
of
transgender
immigrants
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
or
ncte
listed
immigration
reform
as
one
of
its
13
goals
for
2013
ncte
is
also
publishing
a
report
on
transgender
peoples
experiences
in
immigration
enforcement
to
illustrate
why
immigration
reform
is
critical
for
the
community
when
asked
why
ncte
is
prioritizing
immigration
reform
jessica
jeanty
a
postgraduate
law
fellow
with
ncte
replied
trans
people
are
disproportionately
impacted
by
problems
with
the
immigration
system
ranging
from
access
to
asylum
to
profiling
in
enforcement
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
discrimination
and
violence
in
the
system
a
pathway
to
citizenship
is
important
because
trans
citizens
and
noncitizens
alike
need
to
be
able
to
work
care
for
their
families
and
have
basic
protections
so
they
can
live
decent
lives
as
part
of
nctes

on
immigration
reform

commonsense
immigration
reform
the

also
brought
more
than
100
people
to
capitol
hill
in
june
to
advocate
for
immigration
reform
and
the
employment
nondiscrimination
act
a
bill
that
would
prohibit
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
to
facilitate
the
mobilization
of
its
members
and
allies
during
the
august
recess
ncte
launched
an
august
recess
action
center
to
give
members
the
tools
they
need
to
actively
support
immigration
reform
these
tools
include
tips
for
scheduling
meetings
with
members
of
congress
as
well
as
an
interactive
map
to
find
local
town
halls
so
that
ncte
members
can
ask
their
senators
and
representatives
to
protect
transgender
people
in
the
workplace
and
reform
our
broken
immigration
system
the
action
center
also
has
a
submission
form
for
people
to
share
stories
of
transgender
immigrants
impacted
by
immigration
law
on
account
of
their
gender
identity
the
personal
and
oftenpainful
stories
put
a
face
to
the
issue

drive
home
the
need
for
reform
among
policymakers
and
their
constituents
in
