overwhelming
passage
of
proposition
187
and
the
republican
takeover
of
congress
promises
an
intensified
federal
focus
on
reducing
illegal
immigration
the
political
battle
is
over
says
dan
stein
head
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
favors
reducing
illegal
and
legal
immigration
now
the
battle
turns
to
ways
and
means
says
rep
lamar
smith
rtexas
who
could
be
the
next
chairman
of
the
house
subcommittee
on
immigration
passage
of
187
by
such
a
large
margin
created
a
tidal
wave
on
the
way
to
washing
up
on
the
steps
of
the
capitol
newt
gingrich
the
likely
next
house
speaker
says
he
favors
sealing
the
borders
denying
illegal
immigrants
all
benefits
and
faster
deportation
of
illegals
he
predicts
immigration
will
be
an
even
larger
issue
in
the
1996
elections
an
early
consensus
is
likely
on
increased
border
patrols
since
many
democrats
and
republicans
agree
thats
the
best
place
to
focus
resources
that
could
mean
more
sophisticated
detection
technology
thousands
more
border
patrol
agents
and
possibly
a
bordercrossing
fee
even
immigration
advocates
support
tougher
patrols
people
have
been
forced
to
bite
the
bullet
because
alternatives
like
187
are
worse
says
cecilia
munoz
analyst
for
the
national
council
of
la
raza
a
leading
hispanic
civil
rights
group
its
more
humane
to
stop
people
from
coming
than
chase
after
them
when
they
get
here
republicans
also
are
likely
to
launch
indepth
examinations
of
deficiencies
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
long
seen
as
one
of
the
most
inept
federal
agencies
but
observers
say
its
too
soon
to
predict
sweeping
changes
because
the
gop
is
deeply
divided
on
key
aspects
of
the
immigration
issue
the
change
in
congress
does
not
guarantee
that
the
restrictionist
view
will
prevail
says
munoz
its
premature
to
predict
a
tidal
wave
the
gop
is
divided
on
questions
of
a
national
identity
verification
system
and
measures
like
proposition
187
that
would
kick
illegal
immigrant
children
out
of
public
schools
and
require
teachers
to
report
them
smith
says
he
thinks
he
can
bring
doubtful
republicans
around
on
some
kind
of
id
card
by
calling
it
a
tamperproof
social
security
card
that
no
one
has
to
carry
at
all
times
but
theres
no
consensus
at
all
on
the
education
question
thats
clearly
the
most
controversial
issue
and
will
be
the
subject
of
hearings
he
says
john
miller
an
immigration
expert
at
the
conservative
manhattan
institute
think
tank
in
washington
says
immigration
is
one
of
those
realignment
issues
that
produce
unconventional
alliances
you
cant
draw
neat
party
lines
on
immigration
he
says
some
of
the
strongest
opponents
of
proposition
187
were
conservative
republicans
jack
kemp
and
william
bennett
wednesday
they
joined
28
other
conservative
leaders
in
a
letter
to
gingrich
urging
rejection
of
any
national
computerized
id
system
calling
it
misguided
and
dangerous
meanwhile
sen
orrin
hatch
rutah
and
rep
henry
hyde
rill
are
in
line
to
be
chairmen
of
their
respective
judiciary
committees
and
both
are
known
as
strongly
proimmigrant
hatch
called
for
repealing
employer
sanctions
a
move
long
sought
by
immigration
advocates
who
contend
sanctions
foster
discrimination
ironically
we
could
end
up
with
more
friends
in
the
congress
than
we
had
two
weeks
ago
says
munoz
republicans
are
also
expected
to
discuss
reducing
legal
immigration
something
some
democrats
have
called
for
but
smith
says
he
doubts
that
has
widespread
support
another
proposal
amending
the
constitution
to
deny
citizenship
to
usborn
children
of
illegals
is
so
fraught
with
emotion
many
republicans
may
steer
clear
the
ugliness
of
the
187
debate
is
unappealing
to
the
gop
on
the
national
level
says
munoz
immigration

the
passage

and
strong
signals
sent
by
the
leadership
of
the

republican
majority
