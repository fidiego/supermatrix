soon
after
president
clinton
enacted
broad
new
restrictions
in
september
against
illegal
immigration
many
conservative
lawmakers
vowed
to
make
reductions
in
legal
immigration
a
chief
goal
in
1997
but
four
months
later
senior
house
and
senate
members
say
that
effort
has
stalled
and
congress
will
probably
not
reduce
the
number
of
foreigners
immigrating
here
legally
a
figure
that
approaches
one
million
a
year
anytime
soon
i
really
dont
see
much
prospects
of
more
action
in
that
area
at
least
not
this
year
senator
trent
lott
of
mississippi
the
majority
leader
told
the
united
states
chamber
of
commerce
last
week
representative
lamar
smith
the
texas
republican
who
wrote
the
illegal
immigration
bill
in
the
house
last
year
and
tried
unsuccessfully
to
include
a
30
percent
reduction
in
legal
immigration
after
five
years
said
in
an
interview
unlike
last
year
im
not
planning
to
introduce
a
major
bill
any
time
soon
three
factors
caused
the
turnabout
republican
and
democratic
strategists
said
first
declining
republican
support
among
hispanic
and
asianamerican
voters
in
november
has
caused
many
republicans
to
voice
fears
that
their
party
is
becoming
viewed
as
antiimmigrant
second
one
of
the
senates
main
advocates
of
reducing
legal
immigration
alan
k
simpson
republican
of
wyoming
retired
he
was
replaced
last
friday
as
head
of
the
senate
immigration
panel
by
a
staunch
supporter
of
legal
immigration
spencer
abraham
republican
of
michigan
mr
abraham
outlined
his
priorities
on
tuesday
in
a
speech
at
the
cypress
semiconductor
corporation
in
san
jose
calif
which
like
many
other
silicon
valley
companies
relies
heavily
on
foreignborn
engineers
legal
immigration
has
been
a
positive
thing
and
something
we
must
continue
to
defend
mr
abraham
a
grandson
of
lebanese
immigrants
said
those
who
wish
to
see
wholesale
reductions
are
headed
in
the
wrong
course
mr
abraham
also
said
it
made
little
sense
to
have
a
single
agency
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
responsible
for
keeping
out
illegal
immigrants
and
at
the
same
time
letting
in
legal
immigrants
and
refugees
he
suggesting
splitting
the
ins
into
two
agencies
and
shifting
many
of
its
borderenforcement
duties
to
the
customs
service
the
final
factor
is
that
the
enactment
of
the
immigration
bill
and
the
welfare
bill
which
sharply
restricts
federal
benefits
to
legal
immigrants
seems
to
have
spent
at
least
for
the
present
the
public
anger
against
immigrants
and
allowed
lawmakers
and
policy
makers
to
focus
on
carrying
out
the
complicated
new
laws
its
pretty
clear
senator
jon
kyl
republican
of
arizona
said
in
a
telephone
interview
that
the
big
legislative
issue
was
accomplished
last
year
and
that
the
primary
work
this
year
will
be
oversight
even
as
supporters
of
deeper
cutbacks
in
legal
immigration
retrench
on
the
legislative
front
they
are
preparing
a
series
of
hearings
to
insure
that
the
clinton
administration
carries
out
the
new
immigration
law
as
congress
intended
were
dealing
with
sweeping
new
legislation
the
immigration
and
naturalization
commissioner
doris
m
meissner
told
reporters
on
tuesday
as
she
announced
details
of
her
agencys
31
billion
budget
for
the
1997
fiscal
year
up
from
15
billion
in
1993
the
budget
this
year
finances
1000
new
border
patrol
agents
mrs
meissner
said
including
251
in
texas
237
in
california
and
166
in
arizona
mr
clinton
has
promised
to
work
with
congress
to
repeal
some
of
the
restrictions
on
benefits
for
legal
immigrants
but
mr
lott
and
other
republicans
have
signaled
no
willingness
to
broker
any
changes
in
the
welfare
law
potentially
more
troublesome
for
the
white
house
is
congresss
intent
to
investigate
the
administrations
handling
of
several
immigration
issues
republicans
have
contended
that
in
the
administrations
rush
to
naturalize
as
many
immigrants
as
possible
before
election
day
1996
the
ins
allowed
convicted
criminals
to
become
citizens
representative
robert
k
dornan
the
california
republican
who
narrowly
lost
to
loretta
sanchez
a
democrat
is
asserting
that
some
of
those
illegal
voters
cost
him
reelection
the
orange
county
district
attorney
is
investigating
the
matter
republicans
are
also
looking
into
accusations
that
the
immigration
service
falsified
figures
to
make
its
enforcement
operation
along
the
californiamexico
border
look
more
effective
than
it
is
in
addition
they
want
to
see
what
punishment
the
justice
department
gives
to
13
officials
who
the
departments
inspector
general
concluded
deceived
a
congressional
delegation
that
visited
the
agencys
operations
in
miami
the
ins
has
a
history
of
being
mismanaged
said
mr
smith
who
as
head
of
the
house
immigration
panel
will
most
likely
be
the
administrations
chief
inquisitor
this
year
mr
smith
added
that
he
would
hold
hearings
on
changes
in
legal
immigration
but
perhaps
not
until
next
year
and
with
the
purpose
of
reaching
a
consensus
that
may
be
difficult
unlike
restricting
illegal
immigration
which
had
bipartisan
support
the
campaign
to
cut
legal
immigration
faced
stiff
resistance
from
an
unusual
alliance
of
hightechnology
companies
grassroots
immigration
groups
and
civilliberties
organizations
republicans
and
democrats
were
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
but
republicans
were
more
deeply
divided
critics
like
mr
smith
and
mr
kyl
say
the
current
system
imposes
unfair
burdens
on
local
governments
and
depresses
wages
in
some
fields
supporters
of
the
current
immigration
levels
like
mr
abraham
argue
that
immigrants
do
not
sponge
off
society
but
work
hard
and
spur
job
growth
congress
last
year
split
the
immigration
bill
in
two
parts
one
dealing
with
legal
immigrants
and
the
other
with
illegal
immigrants
a
practical
effect
was
to
doom
the
changes
in
legal
immigration
which
could
not
survive
politically
on
their
own
advocates
of
lower
legal
immigration
vowed
to
fight
on
this
year
but
their
difficult
struggle
was
made
even
harder
when
mr
abraham
was
named
last
week
to
head
the
senate
immigration
panel
weve
made
no
secret
of
our
displeasure
with
abraham
said
dan
stein
executive
director
of
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
which
supports
lower
levels
of
legal
immigration
hes
basically
for
sale
to
these
hightech
companies
that
want
to
import
cheap
programmers
and
engineers
rosemary
jenks
director
of
policy
analysis
for
the
center
for
immigration
studies
a
washington
research
group
that
supports
lower
levels
of
legal
immigration
said
in
an
interview
certainly
we
would
have
preferred
that
jon
kyl
had
taken
the
position
he
has
a
better
understanding
of
the
reality
of
immigration
in
the
1990s
outside
cypress

on
tuesday
more
than
50
supporters
of

immigration
