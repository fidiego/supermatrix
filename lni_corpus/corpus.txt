3 of 997 documents financial times london england november 13 2007 tuesday asia edition 1 hearts minds and immigration byline by gideon rachman section comment pg 13 length 916 words when the british government surveyed employment in the city of london recently it came across a pleasingly symmetrical fact about onethird of the highskilled workers were foreigners and so were about onethird of the lowskilled workers this knowledge that foreign workers are critical to the most dynamic sector of the economy has not stopped gordon brown the prime minister from growling about british jobs for british workers across the developed world politicians such as mr brown are responding to public fears about high levels of immigration in italy last week police backed by bulldozers swept through settlements of romanian immigrants in the us hillary clinton recently made the first false step in her formidable presidential election campaign by sounding soft on illegal immigration some antiimmigration activists think we are now reaching a tipping point in both western europe and north america immigration is becoming such a hot political issue that politicians will be forced to clamp down the period of high migration will come to a close i doubt it this is not as some argue because it would be impossible to clamp down the reason is more heartening most western societies do not have the stomach to take the extremely tough and illiberal measures that would be needed immigration is so controversial that the search for a middle ground sounds futile but i was surprised to discover at a recent ditchley foundation conference that there are things that the pro and anti camps agree on first everybody agrees that while the data are lousy we are in a period of high migration second both sides of the debate are really talking about managed migration there are very few antiimmigration activists who actually want no new migrants and even the most liberal advocates of free movement of labour rarely argue for dismantling all immigration controls it also became apparent that the argument is ultimately about political and social choices rather than economics of course economic needs drive many of the flows of people migrants move to find work and employers want rare skills or cheap and willing labour but the economic effects of all this migration are ambiguous a british study recently suggested that while immigration has increased the size of the uk economy it has not significantly increased percapita income in the short term immigrants may make life tougher for unskilled nativeborn workers over the longer term immigrants tend to be a dynamic group who found businesses and create jobs you can argue the economics either way the thesis that immigration cannot be controlled is also unconvincing it all depends on the measures you are prepared to take when the danish government brought in draconian restrictions on arranged marriages and asylumseekers it did drive down the number of migrants to the country if the us really were to build a giant fence along its mexican border it probably would reduce illegal immigration both examples underline something important about the immigration debate in the rich world the fatalists are wrong this is not about unstoppable economic forces there are political choices to be made opinion polls in north america and western europe suggest at first glance that those choices will increasingly be to restrict immigration there are times when public concern about immigration peaks and politicians feel compelled to take action italy facing a recent influx of up to 500000 romanians seems to be in that situation now the netherlands a few years ago underwent a political upheaval when pim fortuyn created a new party capitalising on unease about highlevels of muslim immigration but the dutch example is less clearcut than it appears antiimmigration sentiment seems to have waned in the past couple of years postfortuyn political parties that based their pitch on restricting immigration have not really prospered the danish election today may also show a decline in the power of the antiimmigration movement in britain efforts by the conservatives to play the immigration card have not been crowned with political success in the us tom tancredo a leader of the campaign against illegal immigration has made no headway in his bid for the republican nomination for the presidency this may be because in normal times antiimmigration sentiment is simply not important enough to determine how people vote but it also suggests that voters are more attached to the principles of an open society than the raw polling data on immigration suggest it is certainly possible to crack down on legal and illegal immigration but the necessary measures would often involve sacrificing freedom and convenience you could have much tougher controls at borders and even longer waitingtimes at immigration control forget just hopping on the eurostar to paris you could introduce identity cards in countries such as the us and the netherlands that have long resisted them you could bind employers in even more red tape you could restrict peoples right to marry you could arrange mass deportations of illegal immigrants and shut your eyes to the resulting injustices some combination of all of those measures probably would dramatically reduce immigration but in the process you would risk creating countries that are not only less welcoming to immigrants they would probably be much less palatable for nativeborn citizens as well gideonrachmanftcom loaddate november 12 2007 language english documenttype stories publicationtype

281 of 997 documents palm beach post florida april 22 2012 sunday final edition interest swarms ariz case the high court could set a precedent for florida in a battle starting this week byline by john lantigua palm beach post staff writer section a section pg 1a length 1350 words on wednesday the supreme court will hear the state of arizona argue that it has a right to enforce its own immigration laws the federal government will counter that only it has constitutional authority to write immigration law and that allowing individual states to do so would invite legal havoc and could cause rifts with foreign allies since five other states also have recently passed strict immigration enforcement laws parts of which hinge on the arizona outcome many people including illegal immigrants are watching the case closely the stakes are high said florida international university law professor and constitutional expert elizabeth price foley not only is legal precedent in play but interaction between police and minorities on us streets in particular latinos also could be affected while florida has not passed its own immigration legislation such bills have bounced around the state legislature the past two years and the arizona ruling could affect future florida law florida and 15 other states filed a brief with the court in support of arizona states have a preexisting authority to make arrests based on violations of federal law that brief states meanwhile 11 states and 41 countries filed briefs siding with the federal government an indication of the resonance of the arizona battle the case also has divided national organizations active on both sides of the emotional immigration issue sb 1070 is not only constitutional but necessary in the face of the obama administrations refusal to enforce the law and protect the security and interests of the american people said the federation for american immigration reform the most powerful conservative group active on the immigration issue but the liberal national immigration law center sees it differently our countrys greatness is derived from its diversity said executive director marilena hincapie no law should force those of us who look or sound foreign to be subject to racial profiling or other discrimination unfortunately arizonans basic rights will be at risk if sb 1070 is allowed to go into effect and the ramifications of this decision will be felt across the country disputed sections of the law in 2010 arizona passed senate bill 1070 becoming the first state in the modern era to try adopt its own immigration law federal courts subsequently let parts of the law stand but blocked others the supreme court is expected to rule in june on those disputed sections one section requires that arizona state and local police determine the immigration status of any person encountered in a lawful stop if reasonable suspicion exists the person is not legally in the us the arizona law also makes it a criminal act for a person to be in work in or seek work in the state without proper documents to prove that person is in the us legally under federal law those are civil infractions not criminal another disputed section allows arizona police to arrest people without warrants expressly for the purpose of their being deported a duty currently overseen only by federal agents justice elena kagan who was solicitor general in the obama administration when the government sued arizona will not participate in the case her recusal creates the possibility of a 44 vote in that case the verdict of the lower courts would be upheld and arizona would lose legal experts say the case will hang on an issue known as preemption which means that federal law supersedes state law if the two conflict but arizona is arguing that it is not exceeding or violating federal law simply helping enforce it sb 1070 does not impose its own substantive immigration standards but simply uses state resources to enforce federal rules arizona states in its brief arizona officials say they were forced to act because the arizona desert had become the preferred route for throngs of illegal immigrants crossing into the country and the us was not doing enough to stop them in its brief the state refers to the relaxed and indeterminate enforcement posture of the federal government no one doubts that unlawful immigration has a disproportionate impact on arizona the brief says its a national issue us says in response the us asserts that the national government is responsible for the treatment of foreign citizens on us soil because it is the nation as a whole not any single state that must respond to the international consequences of such treatment the government says enforcing immigration law involves numerous considerations including national security and law enforcement but also foreign policy and humanitarian considerations arizona seeks to interpose its own judgments on those sensitive subjects the us brief states arizona has adopted its own immigration policy which focuses solely on maximum enforcement for each state and each locality to set its own immigration policy in that fashion would wholly subvert congress goal of a single national approach the brief says fius price foley said that in deciding the case the court must establish what congress intended when it passed the many regulations contained in the us immigration and nationality act did congress intend when passing the current federal immigration law to occupy the field of immigration and not allow states to get involved she said or alternatively did congress want states to help enforce immigration law she said language exists in the act that says federal officials shall respond to an inquiry by a federal state or local government agency seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual that language suggests that congress may have seen a role for states in enforcing immigration law particularly in the identification of illegal aliens she said price foley sympathizes with the arizona effort if the arizona law is struck down the states will be fully at the mercy of a seemingly disinterested federal executive branch powerless to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants across the borders she said experts ariz has uphill fight but areto imoukhuede a nova southeastern university law professor said he will be very surprised if arizona wins until this case came along immigration was considered a textbook example of a field of law that congress occupied and not the states he said if the court were to rule for arizona it would be contrary to our understanding of constitutional law he said arizona would have to show a compelling legal reason for the court to break with its long history of leaving immigration enforcement to the federal government he doubts that problems caused by the porous border will be reason enough if you have lawlessness along the border how do you address it he asked do you pass a blanket law based on immigration status do you risk racial profiling is that the only way to do it he said he doesnt think so and that the arizona law runs afoul of equal protection principals in the constitution university of miami law professor rebecca sharpless also said arizona faces an uphill climb to win the case to get around the preemption issue in the supreme court case arizona is trying to sell its immigration enforcement regime as mere cooperation with the federal government she said but the supreme court is unlikely to buy what arizona is selling she said one reason is that a federal program 287g already provides for cooperation between the us and states in immigration matters but under the direction of the us she also said that while the conservative majority on the court has often been sympathetic to states rights in other cases immigration is different territory the supreme court justices who have traditionally believed in state power have also traditionally deferred to federal immigration authorities she said it will be interesting to see how the justices rule in the arizona case staff

288 of 997 documents the indiana lawyer november 23 2011 knowing the possible consequences legal community works to ensure defendants know plea agreements could impact immigration status length 1398 words knowing the possible consequences legal community works to ensure defendants know plea agreements could impact immigration status in her allen superior courtroom judge fran gull makes a point to tell every defendant who comes before her that signing a guilty plea could impact his or her immigration status until recently the judge didnt provide that warning but a ruling from the supreme court of the united states in march 2010 made her more mindful of what those appearing before her know and she wants to ensure they understand that signing a plea agreement could impact their immigration status or residency in this country the holding in padilla v kentucky requires criminal defense attorneys to advise clients about possible immigrationrelated consequences that might materialize from signing a plea agreement the ruling created ripple effects throughout the legal community as more lawyers and judges have grappled with how to best respect the spirit of that ruling and many are shifting their practices and policies to make sure that notification isnt overlooked while lawyers are tasked with making sure clients are aware of the impact some have decided the courts should be the final gatekeepers in ensuring defendants sixth amendment rights are protected and lawyers arent rendering ineffective assistance of counsel the dilemma we face is that if we dont ask everybody were going to be accused of profiling and not treating everyone the same gull said having the court handle the warning in the guilty plea stage prevents defendants from coming back later and saying they were never warned allen countys approach is one that more judges are considering after the padilla ruling came down some had already started using a similar approach because of past indiana appellate caselaw implying that requirement but a consistent approach hasnt been established courts continue studying padilla and its impacts and some judges in marion and lake counties say individually they are notifying defendants during initial or plea hearings about the possible immigration consequences they could face in marion county superior judge mark stoner says that he has been asking defendants about those negative immigration effects if the person has an interpreter and confirms being a citizen of another country the prosecutors office incorporates language mentioning deportation in major felony guilty plea agreements he said lake superior judge tom stefaniak said hes also notifying defendants during initial and plea hearings though he says not all criminal and county court judges are doing that taking responsibility not everyone in the legal community agrees the courts should be taking that approach so late in a case since it falls on an attorneys shoulders to provide that notification and legal advice but in the end both courts and lawyers are working together to make sure defendants understand the possible immigration implications of pleading guilty developments in immigration law since 1990 have made the whole situation progressively more threatening for aliens convicted of a broad range of criminal offenses including many that formerly generated no immigration penalties said john scanlan a professor emeritus at indiana university maurer school of law the bottom line is that many criminal lawyers face sanctions unless they learn a lot of immigration law fast and everyone is trying to make sure this is addressed questions remain open following the ruling specifically whether padilla is retroactive and whether the holding covers collateral consequences outside the deportation context the 7th circuit court of appeals ruled in august that padilla is not retroactive but the circuits are split on that issue and the scotus will likely need to weigh on at some point in the meantime public defenders have voiced concern that the decision puts additional pressure on them to advise clients on complex immigration issues and in other areas of the law unfamiliar to them that concern has led both prosecutors and defenders to learn more about immigration law and to seek out more information from fellow attorneys practicing in immigration law theres a lot more overlap than weve ever had before indianapolis immigration attorney john broyles said about criminal and immigration law from our side were getting more criminal defense attorneys referring clients to us and were working more closely with a larger group statewide than ever before broyles said the biggest issue is attorney awareness and making sure they are adequately advising clients about the possible immigration effects he found many immigration clients postpadilla had been inadequately advised in a criminal case or not even told about the possible immigration consequences unless you know substantive immigration law its hard to look into the future and know how this could impact your client broyles said criminal defense attorneys have to figure out what a clients immigration status is something not always easy in itself and then be able to determine how a conviction could impact possible future immigration cases that use complex standards and fall under different laws broyles sees a danger that some attorneys might start developing a pattern for certain types of clients and cases thinking that one is similar to another without taking all the nuances and variations into account dont assume the next person who comes in with an identity theft case warrants the same plea agreement you just gave to someone else in an identity theft case he said im really hopeful they seek out immigration counsel and get that specific information they need on a casebycase basis indianapolis attorney dave cook former marion county public defender who went into immigrationfocused criminal defense after leaving office in 2007 said he filed multiple postconviction relief petitions for clients after padilla came down before padilla cook said that there was a mistaken belief in the defense bar that it was sometimes better to not know about those immigration consequences so that if asked an attorney couldnt be held to that knowledge for example he handled a drug case where a mans previous lawyer went on the court record saying that a misdemeanor drug conviction wouldnt result in deportation when in fact immigration law says that those lesser crimes could count against someone you recognize that when you do criminal work many people are penaltyfocused in criminal cases and theyre only looking at whether they will go to jail and for how long he said so often you have clients who are willing to plead as long as they can avoid jail as a lawyer you have to look past that penal interest and whether youll win the criminal case and focus on the bigger picture of how this persons life might be impacted in allen county gull is trying to make sure those who come before her in court know that plea agreements could impact their residency she has gotten many surprised looks from people during the guilty plea process when she mentions the immigration consequences whether or not the attorney may have informed that person about the immigration possibilities isnt the point gull said its about taking another step to make sure defendants understand their rights its making a nice clean record so these issues dont come back to haunt us she said but a courts approach providing the notification isnt the answer to what the padilla court found as a problem cook said as an attorney whos successfully merged immigration and criminal defense practices he doesnt think the court notification addresses the concern because its aimed more at protecting the courts and not the defendants rights putting a clause in the agreement and telling them about it doesnt really resolve the issue of whether their attorney has given adequate counsel he said noting that if a court says anything about this it should be at the earliest point in the process and not at the last stage of a guilty plea hearing from a judges perspective it may fix any problem they might see from this but it doesnt really fix the problem that exists about adequate representation you cant take that from the lawyers hands because its that persons job to make sure their client truly understands loaddate october 9 2012 language english publicationtype magazine

294 of 997 documents tulsa world oklahoma september 6 2011 tuesday final edition immigration cases may see delays byline ginnie graham world staff writer section news pg a1 length 1638 words read the federal memo on the immigration prosecution priority shift and a handout from the american immigration lawyers association a shift in prioritizing which immigration cases to prosecute for deportation has created hope some of it false among those living in the country illegally the change does not alter eligibility for legal residency or prevent an arrest but it may stave off deportation and give immigrants a chance to apply for a work visa in some cases according to oklahoma immigration attorneys and activists there is no immigration benefit being derived as a result of this said maria reyes director of the ywca multicultural center currently there is no existing formal policy or guidelines it is totally up to the discretion of immigration we are trying to warn people to not go to any notarios or immigration attorneys who are misleading people andor possibly ripping them off people are misunderstanding this due to misinformation and unrealistic hope a memo sent by us immigration and customs enforcement director john morton in june outlined broad criteria prosecutors may use in deciding to close a case the agency is to focus more aggressively on removing immigrants posing a threat to public safety and repeat immigration law violators because the agency is confronted with more administrative violations than its resources can address the agency must regularly exercise prosecutorial discretion if it is to prioritize its efforts the memo stated the memo was followed with a statement aug 18 from homeland security secretary janet napolitano the statement announced the launch of a casebycase review of the nearly 300000 cases pending in immigration courts napolitanos statement said immigrants in closed cases would also receive a chance to apply for a work permit cases deemed low priority will either be administratively closed or no enforcement action will be taken a temporary decision not to use government resources to deport those individuals attorneys said this applies only to immigrants with cases pending it does not give a pathway for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants including about 75000 in oklahoma to apply for work authorization while the immigration service has not been forthcoming with details the june memo stated that those benefiting the most will be retired and active military members longtime lawful residents elderly residents people brought to the us as children pregnant or nursing women victims of serious crimes and people with disabilities however they remain deportable and have no benefits said attorney chris gentges of the ywca multicultural center it will only impact people who are currently in detention we dont know the impact of unauthorized people in the community there are no guidelines at this time the number of cases pending in immigration courts in the us reached an alltime high of 267752 by the end of december 2010 which is 44 percent higher than the end of the 2008 fiscal year according to a report by the nonprofit transactional records access clearinghouse trac the average wait for a case resolution nationally is about 467 days up from 456 days in september 2009 deportations have also reached recordsetting highs during president obamas administration with more than 393000 being ordered out of the country last year in oklahoma about 913 cases are pending with an average wait of 326 days last year 1415 orders of removal were made in oklahoma up from 449 a decade earlier according to trac doug stump oklahoma city attorney and first vice president of the american immigration lawyers association said attorneys in the state have made requests for deferred action in pending cases but the immigration service is still making those reviews the agency is not making snap decisions in oklahoma they are measuring the equities of each case he said stumps calls the change simply smart enforcement it provides government an effective means of removing on a priority basis those undocumented who have committed crimes or would otherwise do us harm stump said it puts those individuals who pose a threat to society at the very top of the removal list and undocumented grandmothers tickets for signal light violations at the bottom of the list the government has limited resources to conduct so the new policy is just doing what is done in good practices all across the various sectors of law enforcement it targets bad guys stump criticized programs such as the 287g agreement with the tulsa county sheriffs department and the secure communities program which empower local law enforcement officers to enforce the federal immigration laws programs allowing deputies to make immigrationrelated arrests have filled the court system with undocumented high school students and families with no criminal background thus allowing criminal aliens to drag out their cases for years stump said many top congressional republicans have criticized the shift in priorities calling it a backdoor amnesty critics say this is an electionyear ploy to gain support among hispanic voters and immigration advocates this is the latest example of the obama administration playing politics with immigration policy stated us rep john sullivan rtulsa in an email the american people are demanding that our immigration laws be strengthened and enforced while the president is looking for any way he can find to bypass them and that is unacceptable our immigration problem is not going to solve itself and looking the other way only magnifies the problem carol helm of immigration reform for oklahoma now said the alltime high deportation numbers show that immigration laws and enforcement are working obama is knuckling under the open border crowd helm said that crowd is nothing more than the one world order crowd wanting no borders since their agenda is no borders they believe in free access to our labor and money thats why they are pushing this they dont want any restrictions put on the illegal labor coming here helm compared the move to a dictatorship and pushes for approval of the hinder the administrations legalization temptation act halt act which would suspend certain federal prosecutorial discretions in immigration cases until jan 21 2013 the day after obamas first term ends it was prompted by the announcements i just wonder how far we as a nation are going to allow this administration to go helm said the halt act would put the powers of the president back where it should be its an antidote to his power grab new immigration policy what it is not not an amnesty not about granting legal status not a program requiring an application no guarantee a case will be deemed low priority no guarantee low priority or closed cases will have a chance to apply for a work permit what it is creation of a group formed from officials of the department of homeland security and department of justice to review cases pending and close those it considers low priority and aggressively prosecute those considered high priority create departmentwide guidance for agents of the various immigration units to make consistent decisions about who to place in removal proceedings issue guidance on providing discretion in compelling cases for people who already have a final order of removal implement a system for future cases to be reviewed and low priority cases may not be referred to immigration court no rules state that a particular type of case will be deemed low or high priority allows immigrants in cases being closed to apply for a temporary work permit but no guidelines or eligibility rules exist yet source american immigration lawyers association how immigration courts work the us department of justices executive office for immigration review has more than 235 judges across the country conducting administrative proceedings in 59 courts the judges primarily decide whether immigrants charged by the department of homeland securitys immigration divisions should be ordered removed from the country doj provides the judges while dhs provides prosecutors immigrants may hire an attorney for representation but one is not provided for them the oklahoma cases are heard by one of four judges in the dallas court the state is included in the jurisdiction of north texas a judge usually travels to oklahoma for one week a month to hold hearings at the immigration services building in oklahoma city oklahoma city attorney doug stump said the government is showing indications it will probably close the oklahomabased hearings the judges are too busy in dallas to cover oklahoma and the court system doesnt have the funds to man the oklahoma docket anymore stump said doj spokeswoman elaine komis stated in an email the agency has no plans to close the oklahoma hearing locations eoir closely monitors caseload volume types trends and geographic concentration and adjusts resource allocation whenever possible komis stated this includes reassigning positions temporarily detailing judges and staff and using video teleconferencing when appropriate stump said the immigration court system is about to collapse with the rise in arrests a

295 of 997 documents south carolina lawyers weekly august 19 2011 friday border crossing sc s tough new immigration law could push foreignborn workers and their legal needs northward byline phillip bantz section news length 1215 words if south carolinas aggressive new immigration law takes effect next year as scheduled the controversial measure could clog the charlotte immigration court with deportation cases and lead to a spike in business at law practices throughout the carolinas modeled after legislation in arizona the immigration crackdown would allow police to rely on reasonable suspicion when asking for proof of citizenship or legal residence during any kind of stop investigation or arrest the law also establishes an illegal immigration enforcement unit and requires employers to use the federal everify system to check whether employees and job applicants are legal residents gov nikki haley signed the immigration law sb 20 in late june and while it is slated to become effective jan 1 the american civil liberties union has vowed to file suit to halt the measure said victoria middleton executive director of aclu of south carolina she argues that the law promotes racial profiling and is trumped by federal authority the aclu has made similar contentions in pending lawsuits against strict immigration laws in alabama arizona and georgia weve gotten preliminary injunctions in arizona and georgia middleton said its our goal to have the preliminary injunction filed in south carolina before the laws january start date while south carolinas law is months away from taking effect and its future is uncertain some immigration lawyers have already noticed a significant uptick in new clients who are anxious about being deported it has definitely increased business said marco t torres an immigration attorney at the torres law firm in charleston ive seen a lot more people seeking consultation robert j lowe jr of charlestons lowe associates also reports a growing client list as a result of the pending immigration crackdown so far he has had limited success in helping mexican and honduran clients obtain citizenship through asylum theres no question that many of these people are going to be persecuted when they go back to their home countries he said and were seeing some reluctance in federal court to put these people in harms way if an immigrant has no legal standing to be in the country theres not much an attorney can do for them said zachary s naert a solo practitioner in mount pleasant who previously worked for a nonprofit organization that protects the rights of migrant farm workers but naert has found that many immigrants often have at least a possible legal basis to be in the country such as citizenship through marriage or a family member and are unaware of their rights a lot of people dont know he said or if they do know they still might not have done anything about it because theyre scared of attorneys afraid of the system in general or dont have enough money to go through the process bogged down while the threat of the new law is spurring some immigrants to seek out legal advice others are packing up and leaving south carolina for states that have more lenient laws many of them are expected to head to north carolina where immigration attorneys are more plentiful and where police are not required to check a persons immigration status based on suspicion the south carolina attorneys will feel the initial impact but it will eventually come up to us because there arent that many immigration attorneys in south carolina said charlotte immigration lawyer cynthia a aziz of the aziz law firm aziz added that lawyers in the mecklenburg area may also get more clients as a matter of convenience because they are closer to the us immigration court in charlotte which serves north and south carolina all undocumented immigrants who are arrested in the carolinas and have their cases reviewed by a judge end up in the charlotte court aziz who has practiced immigration law for more than 20 years expects that south carolinas crackdown will spark a surge of deportation cases because it allows police to make immigration arrests based on minor violations such as jaywalking or driving with a broken headlight and the immigration court could be overwhelmed she said the court only has three judges in charlotte and theyre already thinly stretched she said so now theyre going to have to process more and more cases and there is going to be a greater backlog lowe the charleston immigration lawyer also expects that daytoday operations will slow down in immigration court because a skeletal crew is running everything and theyre so bogged down that they cant deal with the current system a spokesman for the us department of justice which oversees the immigration court declined comment strained resources legal services of southern piedmont in charlotte relies on volunteer attorneys to help immigrants navigate the court system those lawyers meet oneonone with defendants outside court and take a few minutes to explain their rights and what might happen next they also try to combat the notarios people who masquerade as legal consultants and prey on immigrant communities the unscrupulous and unlicensed consultants collect thousands of dollars in fees from immigrants who are facing deportation and then typically botch their paperwork and skip important court hearings the new immigration law could exacerbate the already widespread abuse by notarios by providing the scammers with hundreds or even thousands of new victims said legal services of southern piedmont project coordinator danielle h lombard when the population of vulnerable people rises then its likely to expect that those who take advantage of them would also proliferate she said legal services of southern piedmont has 22 pro bono immigration lawyers who meet with up to 50 immigrant defendants every week and theyre only getting busier lombard said she expects that the need for legal services will grow as more immigrants are funneled into court we really need more attorneys to become experienced at practicing removal defense and who are willing to help us provide this type of legal assistance which is so necessary she said the carolinas have a shortage of immigration attorneys because the region lacked its own immigration court for so long lombard said before the charlotte court opened in 2008 immigration lawyers in the carolinas had to travel to courts in either georgia or virginia to represent clients in deportation proceedings a major expense and a disincentive to represent them if every single immigrant who had some legal form of relief actually had the money to pay an attorney in north or south carolina there would not be enough attorneys there for them to find one lombard said now with the change of the laws in south carolina the clock is ticking for everyone who has some form of relief and doesnt get an attorney time is also running out for legal services of southern piedmont the programs bank account is nearly empty and it may go under before the new immigration law goes into effect in fact the program barely has enough money to stay afloat through august lombard said were trying to raise enough money to keep it going she said i

149 of 997 documents the record bergen county nj august 23 2007 thursday all editions nj police get orders on illegals must tell feds if arrest is for a serious crime byline by elizabeth llorente staff writer north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 1034 words police officers in new jersey must now notify immigration officials about any undocumented person who is arrested in connection with an indictable crime under a directive issued wednesday by attorney general anne milgram the need for a uniform state policy on notification to immigration authorities became evident after a man identified as being in the country illegally was charged in a recent triple homicide in newark milgram said during a news conference some counties and local police departments do it all the time some sometimes do it and some never she said that changes effective immediately milgram said milgram emphasized that the directive isnt tantamount to a crackdown on illegal immigration it also prohibits law enforcement authorities from inquiring about the immigration status of crime victims and witnesses she said adding that her office will monitor how police implement it several local police officials said theyd have to review the directive before commenting if its an attorney general guideline well certainly follow it to the letter of the law as we do with other attorney general guidelines said teaneck detective lt dean kazinci immigration officials praised the directive we are pleased to learn that the state of new jersey has decided to forge a statewide collaborative partnership with the us immigration and customs enforcement ice office they said in a written statement state and local law enforcement play a critical role in ensuring the safety of our communities the ice office said during the course of daily duties they often encounter foreignborn criminals and immigration violators who pose a threat not only to national security but also to public safety scott weber the field office director for ice in newark said the agency is prepared for an increased workload stemming from the directive we can handle it he said such a directive very likely would have kept jose carranza one of several people charged in the aug 4 killings of three newark college students behind bars after previous charges for child rape and aggravated assault milgram said carranza from peru had been free on bail when the slayings occurred essex county authorities said they were unaware of his status at the time of the two earlier arrests but they also said their policy had been to notify immigration authorities only after a conviction not an arrest this is not about immigration its about crimes milgram said during an interview after the news conference at the end of the day the foremost question is a public safety question illegal immigrants suspected of serious crimes can be a flight risk the attorney general said immigration officials have the power to detain an illegal immigrant based on the civil violation of being in the united states unlawfully pending the prosecution of criminal charges you want to make sure the federal government knows and the county and local prosecutors know a suspects immigration status milgram said its relevant to bail considerations whether an individual has sufficient ties to the community wednesdays directive requires that police check the citizenship nationality and immigration status of suspects during the booking process for charges linked to serious crimes and for driving while intoxicated an officer who finds or suspects illegal status must contact immigration officials as well as the prosecuting agency and the courts in the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years ice received roughly 7400 inquiries about immigration status from new jersey law enforcement authorities said ice spokesman michael gilhooly so far this year that number has risen to 9400 he said ice has been trying to deepen its connections to local county and state law enforcement authorities through a federal program that deputizes police to enforce immigration laws so far only morristown has applied to be admitted into the program which is opposed by immigration advocates who fear it could lead to civil rights abuses against immigrants milgram said any town admitted into the program must implement it within the guidelines of her directive this could make for an interesting battle although he said it said it was about time new jersey does something like this morristown mayor donald cresitello said he didnt believe milgram could restrict his officers actions she might have authority to tell my police what they could do as local police but not when theyre working as federal deputized agents the mayor said emphasizing that he would fight any restrictions that he opposed milgram responded that the directive would supersede federal guidelines because new jersey law enforcement comes first and foremost under her authority some local police said theyve asked for proof of citizenship status from people arrested for major crimes such as robbery and murder although not necessarily for drunken driving paramus deputy police chief richard cary said there already is a question on the departments standard arrest form about immigration status and that officers ask suspects in serious criminal cases whether they are us citizens and have the documentation to prove it however he said that question currently isnt part of the standard procedure for processing dui suspects we do notify immigration officials as to the status cary said what they do with it is up to their office some police said they wished immigration officials would more consistently respond to their calls too often they said immigration authorities seem too busy i would like to see them intervene immediately said clifton police capt robert rowan charles goldstein of the new jersey immigration policy network meanwhile expressed concern that police might abuse their new authority in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform these directives are unavoidable he said but what is crucial is that this not be utilized for false arrests and that this not lead to creeping racial problems the ongoing monitoring by the state will be crucial staff writers william lamb and heather haddon contributed to this article email

305 of 997 documents tulsa world oklahoma june 10 2011 friday final edition feds target immigration law scams byline ginnie graham world staff writer section news pg a1 length 880 words related story alabama oks immigration law a federal crackdown on individuals and groups practicing immigration law without authorization is welcomed by local immigration advocates on thursday three us agencies department of homeland security department of justice and the federal trade commission launched an initiative targeting immigration scams usually involving notarios its immeasurable in oklahoma it is a vast problem that cuts across all sectors of immigration law said douglas stump oklahoma city immigration attorney and current vice president of the american immigration lawyers association existing immigration law provides no relief for many foreign nationals who visit multiple attorneys and notforprofits telling them they are not eligible for relief but they keep looking for hope and corrupt notarios give them false hope the federal effort will focus on enforcement education and continued collaboration the goal is to step up prosecutions of unauthorized people giving immigration advice and services and to educate immigrants on finding legitimate representation attorney chris gentges of the ywca multicultural center said unauthorized services typically pop up as storefronts with a generic spanish name offering cheap services officials may call themselves immigration consultants and some offer tax services people think they are dealing with attorneys gentges said in mexico someone called a notario is a lawyer here it means notary and those people call themselves notario knowing how that is being perceived they are cheaper but they are not authorized to practice immigration law but continue to do so oklahoma has always had a certain number of unauthorized immigration practitioners she said we have problems even in our own industry with attorneys who have been disbarred and still trying to practice immigration law gentges said they have always been there but there may be a few more now the fallout from submitting inaccurate immigration paperwork is expensive and can affect a persons residency or work status its devastating stump said many foreign nationals scammed are not fluent in english and the notarios will have them attest an oath that everything submitted is true they dont know what they are pledging the notarios will provide false information to authorities which will then cause a lifetime ban the foreign national gets deported and the notario has pocketed the money in the unveiling of the effort top federal officials called it a historic effort to combat immigration scams last year the federal government worked with local and state officials to secure convictions with sentences of up to eight years and restitution of more than 18 million the federal trade commission is creating an immigration code in its consumer sentinel network the network is a secure online database that holds more than 6 million fraud complaints and shared with more than 2000 law enforcement entities it will be used as an investigative tool for the federal immigration service fraud division and for national security officers and bolster communication between agencies about scamrelated cases also the agencies will work to increase the number of authorized immigration specialists and organizations fraud committed by the notarios can be prosecuted by local district attorneys and can be investigated by the state attorney general the oklahoma attorney generals office received 11 complaints against immigration service providers in fiscal year 2009 and one for fiscal year 2011 said spokeswoman diane clay as states implement enforcementheavy immigration laws to detain and deport illegal immigrants the notarios use that to their advantage stump said as it stands state and local law enforcement agencies are the club for the notarios stump said the notarios will turn them in to law enforcement if the foreign national attempts to get their money back they are told go ahead and turn me in you are the one to be deported not me they threaten the families if we can get state law enforcement agencies to fill the void then we may see some progress under the obama administration deportation and detentions are at an alltime high going from 369221 in september 2008 to 392862 in september 2010 with the trend continuing the current administration is trying to fashion an avenue for people to step forward but it will take

306 of 997 documents lawyers weekly usa june 2 2011 thursday lawyers lament us supreme court ruling on state illegal worker law byline kimberly atkins section news length 1082 words the recent us supreme court ruling upholding an arizona law imposing sanctions on employers who hire undocumented workers and mandating the use of the federal everify database has drawn criticisms from immigration lawyers as well as from attorneys for business and civil rights groups who say it creates a confusing landscape for employers what this opinion does is open the door to a hodgepodge patchwork of 50 different employment immigration laws around the country which is very dangerous said david leopold president of the american immigration lawyers association and principal of david wolfe leopold associates in cleveland but leopold and others were just as quick to label the ruling in chamber of commerce v whiting a narrow one brushing aside suggestions that the ruling could be a precursor to the court reaching a similar conclusion about arizonas other controversial immigration law sb 1070 which authorizes police to verify a suspects immigration status we are talking about a very limited application of the federal immigration law leopold said whiting does not grant states the right to enforce immigration law agreed linton joaquin general counsel for the washingtonbased national immigration law center business death penalty the 2007 law called the legal arizona workers act subjects employers who knowingly employ undocumented workers to penalties including the suspension or revocation of their business licenses the law also mandates that employers use the federal everify system to check the immigration status of workers federal law makes the use of the everify system voluntary the law referred to by critics as a business death penalty due to its severe penalties drew the opposition of a motley coalition including the us chamber of commerce american civil liberties union service employees international the southern poverty law center and the obama administration who challenged the law in federal court arguing that it was preempted by the immigration reform and control act of 1986 that law preempts any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ or recruit or refer for a fee for employment unauthorized aliens but the us supreme court held in a 53 ruling that the law fell within the licensing and similar laws savings clause of the federal statute and was neither expressly nor impliedly preempted in a statement issued after the ruling was handed down arizona gov jan brewer said she was gratified despite the obama administrations opposition at the us supreme court arizona and all states are now free to take down the help wanted sign for illegal aliens in their states brewer said arizonas employer sanctions law allows the vast majority of businesses that want to play by the rules to comply with federal and state laws against hiring illegal aliens and seeks to punish those employers who take advantage of the federal governments immigration failures because of the law brewer said arizona now leads the nation in use of the federal everify system by employers but critics said the law neither treats employers fairly nor solves the problem of employing illegal workers in fact in some ways it makes the problem of undocumented workers worse because you are just sending them from one state to another if you have 50 different laws leopold said that is a very confusing situation for an employer to do business robin conrad executive vice president of the national chamber litigation center the legal arm of the us chamber of commerce echoed those sentiments in a statement issued after the ruling this ruling does not change the reality that businesses from main street to wall street are overwhelmed by a cacophony of conflicting state and local immigration legislation the growing patchwork of state and local immigration laws is a serious obstacle to doing business across state lines conrad said whats worse the ruling could spur states to pass other immigration statutes and refer to them as licensing laws leopold said what really disturbs me is if the supreme court called this law a licensing rule you could make that argument for any number of laws leopold said leasing and renting might be seen the same way leopold and conrad agreed that the only solution is congressional intervention its time to put politics aside and pass comprehensive immigration reform leopold said in her statement conrad said the decision makes it all the more urgent for congress to bring muchneeded clarity to immigration law through legislative reform including preemption of employmentrelated state immigration laws no blank check brewer said she hoped the court would take a similar approach to sb 1070 the 2010 measure she signed into law requiring police to check the immigration status of an individual who is stopped detained or arrested if a reasonable suspicion exists that the person has entered the country illegally in april the 9th circuit upheld a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of that law and brewer vowed to appeal the ruling to the supreme court while sb 1070 and the legal arizona workers act are obviously different laws i am hopeful and optimistic that the us supreme court will hear arizonas future appeal of the 9th circuit court of appeals decision against sb 1070 and apply the same general principle of federalism by rejecting claims of federal preemption brewers statement said i am more adamant than ever that states do have a complimentary role in enforcing federal immigration laws joaquin vehemently disagreed saying that unlike the whiting case sb 1070 did not involve the application of a federal savings clause the right to enforce immigration law is the issue at the heart of current legal challenges to sb 1070 arizonas racial profiling law joaquin said state legislators who consider whiting a free pass to enact and implement legislation targeting immigrants are gravely mistaken conrad agreed lets be clear the decision does not give states or local governments a blank check to pass any and every immigration law she said immigration regulation continues to be predominantly a federal concern state and local laws that do not carefully and assiduously track federal law or that merely masquerade as licensing laws would still be preempted loaddate june 10 2011 language english documenttype legal

state and regional news length 906 words may 29montgomery backers of arizonastyle illegal immigration laws for alabama received some good news thursday when the us supreme court upheld arizonas law that penalizes employers who hire illegal immigrants but while the court ruled the arizona law is constitutional it has yet to hear or rule on other cases related to other arizona laws that alabama lawmakers are also using as templates here alabama is just one of several states moving ahead with immigration legislation similar to arizonas and a housesenate conference committee will try to iron out the differences between two of those bills at a meeting tuesday if that meeting goes well the sponsor of the house bill said the legislature could take up a final bill later that day house majority leader micky hammon rdecatur said the conference committee version could look like a new bill and with only four days remaining in the legislative session the measure must move rapidly to pass most north alabama lawmakers said something needs to be done to curb illegal immigration but they arent united on a solution one reason immigration bills are so difficult is because the issues on enforcement are so complicated said mac mccutcheon rcapshaw who was a police officer for 25 years the experience of other states that passed their own immigration laws indicates he is correct arizona landed in court soon after its farreaching immigration law took effect in 2010 utah became embroiled in a lawsuit 14 hours after its antiimmigration law went into effect earlier this month in georgia where gov nathan deal signed that states immigration law last week lawmakers said they are awaiting court challenges in alabama the american civil liberties union and the southern poverty law center are eyeing sections of legislation they think could overstep federal law but hammon and sen scott beason sponsor of the senates immigration bill believe alabamas bills would stand up in court both hammons hb56 and beasons sb256 would give police the authority to detain someone they have reasonable suspicion is in the country illegally a provision the bills opponents say violates the us constitution i fully expect this to be challenged in court hammon said we believe ours will stand up in court and we expect that ultimately the supreme court will approve arizonas law beason rgardendale said if alabama has its own immigration law it will be in a position to lead and put pressure on congress to change federal law yet because of the court challenges in other states some legislators here say alabama should wait until decisions come in those cases here are some of their comments sen roger bedford drussellville i believe we should pass everify it puts responsibility on businesses to document their employees are legal everify is the computerized federal database to document a workers legal status that the supreme court just approved hammons bill requires it as for passing law that has constitutionality questions bedford said laws get challenged every year in court sen paul bussman rcullman he would like to see a phasein on any law requiring employers to verify the immigration status of employees if we cant find enough american citizens to fill the jobs then we should look at guestworker provisions sen bill holtzclaw rmadison i believe there is more money leaving the state each year through illegal immigration than the state would spend on defending an immigration law in court sen tammy irons dflorence irons an attorney questions the constitutionality of provisions in alabamas bills requiring police to check the immigration status of people they believe are illegals allowing reasonable suspicion could lead to racial or ethnic profiling both of which are unconstitutional she said sen arthur orr rdecatur states all around us are passing these laws he is skeptical of claims by some employers that they may be forced to close if the state forces them to document employee immigration status rep mack mccutcheon rcapshaw at the end of the day the federal government needs to get a grip on the immigration laws they have all we can do as states is piecemeal efforts until they do he said if alabama passes legislation the law needs to give realistic guidelines and flexibility to police who would act as law enforcers one question is who would pay to house prisoners awaiting deportation rep greg burdine dflorence i support doing something about illegal immigration but am hesitant to obligate the state to pay for lengthy expensive litigation burdine an attorny wishes the state would wait a year before passing its own legislation he also worries about provisions in state bills requiring local law enforcement to house illegal immigrants in county jails until federal immigration officials pick them up alabama is already close to a federal courtordered release of inmates in state prisons and has a backlog of people waiting in county jails

309 of 997 documents the christian science monitor may 13 2011 friday georgia joins mounting red state backlash to obama immigration reform in the same week that president obama tried to lay out a middle path to immigration reform georgia gov nathan deal signed a bill that takes a tough line on illegal immigration byline patrik jonsson staff writer length 829 words three days after president obama mocked republicans as being unreasonable in the national immigrationreform debate at least one republican governor doubled down friday signing an arizonastyle immigration law in protest against what he deems failed federal policies the georgia immigration law signed by gov nathan deal is a redstate rejoinder to mr obamas insistence that some path to citizenship should be a part of any federal immigration reform it gives state police more power to pinpoint people who are in the state illegally and forces larger agribusinesses to run employees names through a federal database to verify their eligibility to work legally inside the united states that such a bill passed in georgia alienating the states powerful agribusiness lobby tourism officials and a nascent latino population is a testament to the symbolic power that governor deal and other republican legislators have invested in the issue indeed with courts likely to strike down the more controversial parts of the law as they have in arizona and utah the symbolism of tilting at an allegedly out of touch washington is perhaps the primary reason for passing the bill this symbolism in the immigration debate is exerting an increasingly powerful sway over the republican party with similar bills churning in alabama and florida and with a presidential election looming deal and his gubernatorial colleagues could yet see their lawandorder approach to immigration reform become a litmus test for republican candidates the divide in terms of the direction of immigration reform is in part a reflection of the fact that we have a stalemate in congress says alan abramowitz a political scientist at emory university in atlanta so now we have moreconservative states in the south and west moving toward tough anti immigration statutes and as a result the republican party has moved increasingly toward this sort of hardline approach politics or upholding the rule of law obama tried to exploit that for his political gain in el paso texas tuesday as he reached out for the latino vote to be sure the president has a mixed record on illegal immigration having deported more illegal immigrants in a single year than any other president obama has also completed a federal border fence and doubled the number of border patrol agents along the border but he suggested mockingly on tuesday that even this was not enough for republicans who are ultimately not interested in tackling illegal immigration in a serious way he said theyll say we need to triple the border patrol or quadruple the border patrol the president said theyll say we need a higher fence to support reform maybe theyll say we need a moat or alligators in the moat theyll never be satisfied and i understand that thats politics deal has a different take on the republican line today we are taking action to uphold the rule of law deal said of the georgia bill friday the bill is an undeniably strong political statement it was passed not only despite legal concerns that it impinges on federal primacy of immigration policy but also despite strong opposition among key constituencies in his own state while the latino vote is still weak making up 3 percent of the voting public the states agricultural interests hold significant sway impact of the georgia bill that georgia republicans were insistent on passing the law despite these hurdles suggests that republican presidential candidates might have to toe the same policy line in the south and west or risk alienating conservative voters in those areas for one indiana gov mitch daniels r whose name is mentioned as a possible republican candidate would have to explain why he demanded the legislature drop a lawenforcement component from two immigration reform bills he signed tuesday the indiana bills in essence compel most businesses to verify the residency status of workers and make undocumented immigrants ineligible to receive college tuition and state welfare benefits the greatest impact of the georgia bill might be on the national debate not on illegal immigration in georgia the bills sponsors though they tweaked language that federal appeals courts have now twice struck down in the arizona bill dont seem overly concerned about the laws constitutionality which the state will likely have to defend in court part of the calculation suggests professor abramowitz is that theyre expecting parts of it to get thrown out the georgia law could however pave the way for other states to challenge washingtons immigration policy and by extension obamas border stance in that way the georgia immigration law offers a gauge of the political landscape heading into the 2012 election with deal for one willing to invite the wrath of farmers and potential tourist and convention boycotts

the arizona law requires local law enforcement officials once they stop a person to verify the immigration status of anyone they reasonably suspect of being in the country illegally the bill originally was signed into law on april 23 2010 by arizona gov jan brewer an amended version of the law one to lessen the prospects that racial profiling could occur passed and was signed into law on april 30 the new version of the law says a law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county city town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the united states or arizona constitution politifact florida has written extensively about the immigration bill for instance we ruled that mccollum committed a full flop for waffling positions on bringing an arizonastyle immigration law to florida in the end he ultimately worked with a state legislator to

immigrationstyle bill that passes the florida senate bennett told marc caputo of the st petersburg timesmiami herald tallahassee bureau bennett said he is concerned with the part of the bill thats most identified with arizonas law the requirement that local police with reasonable suspicion attempt to determine a persons immigration status during a routine traffic stop or arrest bennett said the

section politifact length 1384 words provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants will support a system that allows undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine learn english and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens sources obama immigration plan subjects immigration politifacts top promises obameter in the works the last time we checked on this promise we concluded a congress with republicans in control of the us house of representatives was highly unlikely to approve immigration reform thats still the case but weve noted new action from president obama trying to rekindle public conversation and reset the debate in favor of immigration reform in recent weeks obama has hosted three separate meetings on immigration reform primarily with people who support his views on the matter representatives have included mayors police chiefs business executives religious leaders celebrities and members of the congressional hispanic caucus the statements from the white house after each meeting have echoed similar themes that obama would like fix the broken immigration system that he was disappointed that dream act see update below failed to pass last year that he was working to improve the border enforcement and the legal immigration system and that immigration reform requires legislative action via congress the point to the meetings though looked like rallying his supporters to keep up their own work on immigration in a synopsis of a meeting held april 28 the white house press office noted the president urged meeting participants to help elevate the debate and to reach out in their unique capacities and in a public way to forge partnerships across sectors and across demographics there was broad agreement that more voices are needed to change the tone of the debate so that congress acts to fix the broken system in a way that upholds americas history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants we cant say that we see evidence that congress is more likely to address immigration reform anytime soon but obama looks to be rallying his troops to keep immigration reform in the public eye in the course of our research we ran across critics who said this is for electoral purposes to ensure he retains political support from hispanics going into the 2012 election whatever obamas motivation his hosting of highprofile meetings for immigration reform supporters counts for our purposes we cant say obamas chances for ultimate success are concretely better but the meetings and the white house comments are

reform appears gridlocked for next congress updated wednesday january 5th 2011 by angie drobnic holan the last time we checked in on this promise president obama said he would not be moving on immigration reform in 2009 and we rated the promise stalled in 2010 obama and his fellow democrats pressed forward with the development relief and education for alien minors act better known as the dream act the dream act was a measure to intended give a path to citizenship to illegal immigrants who were brought to the united states as children as long as they completed schooling or served in the military and maintained good moral character while it passed in the us house of representatives it failed procedural hurdles in the senate and never came to a vote the november elections mean the house will have a republican majority in 2011 making passage of the dream act significantly more difficult not to mention passage of a path to citizenship for all illegal immigrants in fact republicans have said they intend to focus on enforcement action it is pointless to talk about any new immigration bills that grant amnesty until we secure the border since such bills will only encourage more illegal immigration said incoming house judiciary chairman lamar smith rtexas in a statement obama said that the failure of the dream act was maybe my biggest disappointment of the lame duck session and that he remained committed to both the dream act and a comprehensive immigration law he said he intended to talk more about immigration in the coming year in hopes of to making it more politically popular in rating this promise we see little reason to expect progress anytime soon though obama has said he intends to continue to press for a path to citizenship for illegal

a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants obama has said he does intend to fulfill his immigration promise but he has also said he will not tackle the issue in 2009 instead immigration reform must get in line behind health care reform financial regulations and a capandtrade plan on climate change obama gave some of his most extended remarks on the matter at an august news conference with the leaders of mexico and canada he said he would push for immigration reform in 2010 after the other initiatives had been handled now am i going to be able to snap my fingers and get this done no this is going to be difficult its going to require bipartisan cooperation there are going to be demagogues out there who try to suggest that any form of pathway for legalization for those who are already in the united states is unacceptable obama said so obama has said hes not moving on this promise in 2009 hes taken steps to appease critics of illegal immigration in the debate over health care reform for example he added restrictions to specifically bar illegal immigrants from using their own money to purchase health insurance through any new health insurance exchanges pending proposals already barred illegal immigrants from receiving subsidized care obama said that he will not push for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in 2009 so we rate this promise stalled

hazleton pa section state and regional news length 1072 words may 05us rep lou barletta has taken his illegal immigration fight to washington when i was mayor i was told that only the federal government could make laws dealing with illegal immigration lucky for me here i am barletta said wednesday the newly elected congressman and former mayor of hazleton is drafting his first piece of legislation which will crack down on socalled sanctuary cities or places where elected officials choose not to enforce immigration policy barletta said he is also creating the new 112th congress immigration reform caucus which will closely examine american immigration policy and come up with ways to prevent illegal immigration the american people sent me here last november to fix washington they sent me here to fix our broken system i know im not alone in that all across the country the american people voted in new members of congress and gave them the same order fix whats broken he said barletta who announced his plans at a capitol news conference wednesday said he has not signed up anyone to join his caucus and acknowledged that congress already has an immigration caucus but he said his caucus is exclusively for freshmen this is going to give freshmen a platform and bring some fresh ideas he said immigration law is overseen by the house judiciary committee whose chairman is rep lamar smith rtexas the other immigration caucus is headed by brian billbray rcalif barlettas first bill tentatively known as the mobilizing against sanctuary cities act will withhold federal funding from cities whose elected officials have willfully chosen not to enforce immigration policy the congressional research service a nonpartisan agency that provides support to congress has described such places as having adopted dont ask dont tell policies in which city employees including police personnel are not required to report illegal immigrants to federal authorities i feel that i am standing up for the millions of americans who believe in the rule of law and also for the legal immigrants who followed the rule of law to come to america barletta said he asked the research service to compile a list of the cities and calculate the amount of federal taxpayer dollars each receives more than 100 cities have forbidden their police from asking someones immigration status or providing information on illegal immigration to the federal government they include philadelphia new york san diego san francisco chicago baltimore new orleans and new haven conn in some cases mayors have said they do not want police spending their time on a federal matter illegal immigration when other crimes are more important in others mayors have backed the desire of large latino populations who do not want relatives ensnared in immigration raids barletta said he considers the sanctuary cities in violation of the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act of 1996 that makes it a crime for any state or local government to prohibit their employees from sharing information about illegal aliens with the federal government they should not receive millions or even billions in tax dollars as a reward barletta said while announcing his plans barletta noted that lawsuits were filed against hazleton and arizona for trying to uphold federal immigration policy if the federal government wants to sue the state of arizona because it claims the state is breaking federal law then it should also sue the mayors of sanctuary cities because they are willfully breaking federal immigration law he said word of barlettas initiatives came almost five years after hazleton city council adopted the illegal immigration relief act or iira an ordinance that gained national attention for its tough stance on illegal immigration barlettas 2006 iira was designed to address illegal immigrants in hazleton but the law has never been enforced he introduced it after illegal immigrants were arrested hours apart for incidents involving a gun fired at a city playground and the murder of a man outside his chestnut street home the law would have penalized businesses that employ illegal immigrants and landlords who rent to them it also made english the citys official language city council backed the plan and supporters said it tackled a problem congress had failed to address opponents however said the act violated peoples rights the american civil liberties union or aclu and others challenged the law in us district court in scranton where a judge ruled the act was unconstitutional the city appealed the decision in third circuit court in philadelphia but the ruling there also went against hazleton soon after being elected in november barletta called congress the best place to address immigration a place where it needed to be fixed in the first place while barletta establishes his initiatives in washington hazletons iira is still being considered for review by the us supreme court mayor joseph yannuzzi said they have to make a final decision he said the court will decide whether it will hear the case or it can send it back to the third circuit court yannuzzi expects the decision will come any day now if the decision is not in hazletons favor yannuzzi said he hopes donations will roll in to the citys legal defense fund so it can continue to pursue the matter g terry madonna director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin marshall college in lancaster said he is somewhat surprised with barlettas pursuit of the illegal immigration issue he did not make a big deal of this issue when he was running for congress last year madonna said it was not a central feature of his campaign instead barlettas campaign focused on his opponents record and the recession madonna said i am a little surprised that it comes up now but given what he had when he was a mayor it was certainly something to be expected madonna said staff writer borys krawczeniuk contributed to this

little wonder that the republicandominated georgia legislature waited until the closing days of its session to take up hb 87 an immigration reform law inspired by arizonas controversial move last year to crack down on illegal immigrants two tidal forces within the republican party are pulling at the georgia bill which has to be resolved by a thursday midnight deadline on one side are lawandorder republicans who form the partys urban and suburban base reacting to fears that illegal immigrants are in essence part of a large criminal cartel that siphons off billions in taxpayerfunded entitlements every year on the other are state farmers and agribusinesses many of them financial supporters of the state gop who say the proposed requirements for them to check the immigration status of their quicklyhired field workers are too onerous and could in the worst case leave fields of vidalia onions and groves of peach trees unpicked others worry that hb 87 could spark national boycotts as the arizona law did and hurt the states new south image as a diverse newcomerfriendly place to live work and do business related arizona immigration law and illegal immigrants state of extremes that a southern agricultural state may line up shoulder to shoulder with a western border state with a vastly different economic and cultural history shows how deeply the debate over what to do with americas 13 million undocumented residents has cut into capitol dome politics the measure also promises to test how a bevy of new state immigration proposals will play in nonborder states where republicans are eager to challenge washington on immigration enforcement and other perceived excesses and failures of federal power what youre seeing in georgia is what youre seeing across the country where the demographics of immigration have changed substantially in the past 20 years says kevin johnson an immigration law expert at the university of california at davis at the same time state immigration laws are a very difficult political issue to peg he says because theres dissension in both political parties over how to deal with the problem bills introduced in 30 states as of march lawmakers in 30 us states had introduced 52 immigrationrelated bills many including language similar to the arizona law fourteen of those measures have failed and 36 are still pending reports the national conference of state legislatures so far utah is the only state to follow arizonas lead utah now requires police officers to verify the residency status of anyone detained for a serious crime conceding immigrants role in the agriculture economy however the utah law provides a form of amnesty by making illegals part of a new state guest worker program though legal experts say such a program needs congressional approval if passed georgias law is likely to look more like the one passed in arizona allowing law enforcement to question a persons immigration status based on reasonable suspicion that the person is in the us illegally it makes perfect sense that arizona was at the lead of these measures because its ground zero for illegal immigration but it also makes sense that georgia would be active because georgia is now one of the top illegal immigration destinations says mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies a nonpartisan washington think tank that focuses on the consequences of legal and illegal immigration for us society bill moving toward passage but the question over how tough georgia should get has been a vexing one for republicans the senate watered down a tougher house bill on monday taking out a requirement that all employers use the federal everify system to check the residency status of workers the supreme court is expected to hand down a ruling soon on whether states can force employers to use everify for all new hires the house threw those changes out the next day sending the original bill back to the senate on thursday afternoon the bill continued to move toward passage according to senate sources as legislators debated giving farmers and businesses a grace period under which to comply with the law before receiving penalties if passed the georgia law is likely to meet immediate legal scrutiny on monday the 9th circuit court of appeals joined other federal appeals courts including the 3rd and 10th in shooting down local preemption of federal immigration laws the 9th circuit in san francisco found that the arizona law sb 1070 went too far by giving police new powers to demand identification from suspects and sided with a lower court ruling that the law treads on federal jurisdictions by establishing state criminal penalties for immigrationrelated crimes like the arizona law the georgia bill also creates new criminal categories related to illegal immigration including making the harboring of an illegal immigrant a crime fears of mexican cartels for many georgians the bill addresses growing fears about mexican cartels using local immigrant communities as cover for drugtrafficking and in the process bringing the bloody mexican drug wars closer to home announcing over 600 arrests as part of operation southern tempest which focused on 168 us cities including atlanta immigration and customs enforcement director john morton said in early march these people are up to the worst sort of violent crimes in the communities they live in these guys arent in book clubs theyre in violent street gangs the cartel issue is what drives fears and theyre not irrational or groundless says mr krikorian critics of state immigration crackdowns however point out that the obama administration has taken action to resolve complaints about federal immigration enforcement especially when dealing with violent criminals the department of homeland security deported more illegal immigrants last year more than 400000 than any other us administration in history another way to explain how two vastly different states are reaching the same conclusion on how to tackle the social and economic costs of illegal immigration is that such efforts are in essence a burgeoning form of protest by rising republican majorities in the states as conservatives tease out themes and policies likely to pay dividends in the 2012 election its not a settled debate on the right on thursday indiana gov mitch

washington has issued following press release across washington immigrants looking for the right to live and work legally in our state are unknowingly risking their futures the washington attorney generals office announced 10 new settlements today with individuals accused of illegally practicing immigration law a legal area so complicated that one wrong step can drastically delay citizenship or completely ruin a familys chance to pursue the american dream too many immigration assistants who have no legal training whatsoever appear to offer a helping hand while reaching into immigrants wallets attorney general rob mckenna said the attorney generals consumer protection division took enforcement action in four other cases last year and is currently investigating more than two dozen other immigration assistants out of concern that these individuals are engaged in the unauthorized practice of immigration law the attorney general is also tackling this issue on the legislative front abuse is so widespread that i believe the best solution is to repeal washingtons outdated immigration assistant practices act and replace it with legislation that truly protects consumers from harm mckenna said the bill ive proposed this year ensures that only qualified individuals provide these important services at the request of the attorney general state legislators are considering amending the immigration assistant practices act to allow only licensed attorneys and those authorized under federal law to assist consumers with immigration matters unlike other professional designations in washington the current law does not require that persons wishing to work as immigration assistants demonstrate that they have any training or experience in immigration matters substitute senate bill 5023 sponsored by sen margarita prentice dseattle passed out of the house rules committee on march 31 and is expected to receive a floor vote if signed into law ssb 5023 would be one of the strongest laws of its kind in the united states the bill has support from many immigration attorneys and immigrant rights organizations including the northwest immigrant rights project and oneamerica

learn more about fragomen please visit httpwwwfragomencom section pg 31 vol 19 no 4 length 829 words in the last several years with comprehensive reform of the us immigration system mired in debate numerous states have tried to take matters in their own hands to solve the problem of 11 million undocumented immigrants pleading frustration with the glacial pace of the federal government state legislatures and even some municipalities have enacted their own immigrationrelated statutes state laws have addressed everything from requiring employers to comply with additional employment compliance requirements to authorizing local law enforcement to question individuals they reasonably suspect are undocumented these laws have proliferated throughout the country the national conference of state legislatures reports that 44 state legislatures passed 191 laws and adopted 128 immigrationrelated resolutions in 2010 and more than 100 local governments have enacted immigrationrelated ordinances the state of arizona has led the way enacting two controversial immigration laws in the last four years the 2007 legal arizona workers act and last summers controversial senate bill sb 1070 and now considering a third even harsher bill in some states however a more pragmatic trend may be emerging at the most basic level states facing fiscal crisis are beginning to question the high cost of harsh state immigration provisions state laws that empower police to inquire about immigration status can lead to increased expenses related to arrest processing and jail including the cost of building more facilities to hold the undocumented while they await deportation by the federal government and states hungry for additional revenue are reluctant to follow in arizonas footsteps where an estimated 140 million was lost in boycotts and other business impacts of sb 1070 states are also breathing a sigh of relief that the federal government has postponed implementation of the real id act which would impose drivers license security standards including immigration status checks on state dmvs the postponement is in part due to the financial burdens real id will place on already tight state budgets and in states that have enacted or are considering restrictive statutes some are pushing back in florida state legislators are working to relax an executive order signed by governor rick scott that would require employers to use the largely voluntary federal everify employment verification system after business and agricultural groups among others protested in georgia where tough immigration measures are wending their way through the legislature business leaders have warned that the bill could have a severe impact on the states agriculture industry business groups have also opposed restrictionist proposals in kansas and oklahoma in at least one state legislators have attempted to balance tough enforcement laws with ameliorating provisions in a kind of state facsimile of a model federal comprehensive bill in recent days utah governor gary herbert signed into law a package of immigration bills that includes provisions for tougher enforcement similar to arizonas sb 1070 a labor agreement with mexico and a statelevel guest worker program how such a program would be implemented remains seriously in question since it would require utah to seek a federal waiver of the prohibition against employing undocumented workers still the utah experiment demonstrates that the all restrictions all the time stance of state legislatures may be shifting as lawmakers begin to realize the negative effects of enforcementonly provisions and recognize states economic need for the undocumented workers who shoulder much of the labor burden in the agriculture construction and hospitality industries among others soon however the us supreme court will weigh in on state action in the immigration context and will decide important questions about federal supremacy in the area of immigration the court is expected to rule later this year on whether the legal arizona workers act impermissibly conflicts with federal law and thus is preempted by it the ninth circuit will soon rule on whether arizonas sb 1070 conflicts with federal immigration enforcement laws after the most controversial provisions of the state law were preliminarily enjoined on that ground last summer one key question is whether courts will find justification for state immigration laws in the federal governments inaction but even if these state laws are upheld their effectiveness is doubtful while states may have some ability to legislate in the area of immigration a patchwork of state immigration laws will do little to decisively resolve the fate of the us undocumented population and has already caused uncertainty confusion and unpredictability for business at best state action is a side show to the main event comprehensive federal

321 of 997 documents the christian science monitor march 23 2011 wednesday state illegal immigration laws what have they accomplished five years into a legislative surge state illegal immigration laws have yielded few arrests but they have stirred a populist backlash say immigrant rights groups byline aaron couch contributor length 902 words the wave of immigration laws that has swept through states since 2006 shows few signs of letting up with state legislators expected to introduce about 1400 bills this year yet five years into this legislative surge the toughest laws have not recast immigration in the ways that legislators might have intended from an enforcement standpoint the impact of state antiimmigration laws like arizonas controversial sb 1070 is almost negligible says veronica dahlberg an immigrants rights activist the far greater impact has been social hispanic groups say laws targeting illegal immigrants have reflected and even intensified the rising anti immigration movement both in statehouses and on the streets the result is a legislative record from arizona to florida that hasnt made much of a mark on illegal immigration but has fueled a populist backlash against it this is particularly true in some places because theres been very rapid growth in immigrant populations says marc rosenblum a senior analyst at the migration policy institute the trend was sparked by a dramatic uptick in illegal immigration in the decade before 2006 roughly half of all unauthorized immigrants now in the country some 6 million in all came to the united states during that period the response from state legislatures built rapidly in 2006 they passed twice as many immigration laws as they had a year earlier by 2008 they passed five times the 2005 number a level that has stayed steady since last year state legislators introduced about 1400 immigrationrelated bills more than 200 of which became laws the majority of these laws have been neutral on illegal immigration but some of the most noteworthy have taken a tough stance and more of the same is expected this year ·about a dozen states are now considering bills like arizonas sb 1070 which requires police officers to check a persons immigration status during routine stops ·on march 16 utah gov gary herbert r signed four immigration bills which would among other things allow undocumented immigrants to work in the state and allow police to check the immigration status of people arrested for serious crimes the bills were seen as an attempt to find a middle ground in the immigration debate ·the virginia legislature is considering an effort to ban unauthorized immigrants from enrolling in public universities ·a florida bill would require anyone employed in the state be run though everify a federal citizenship and immigration registry currently all federal employees and contractors must be run through everify but applying this to all workers in a state would be a first yet the track record for recent immigration legislation suggests that explicitly antiillegal immigration bills are more the exception than the rule some 71 percent of the state immigration laws passed from 2006 to 2010 were neutral toward undocumented immigrants a small portion of these laws could actually be said to be tolerant of unauthorized immigrants such as a 2006 nebraska law granting instate tuition to some unauthorized immigrants see graphic in a testament to the difficulty of passing tough laws arizona defeated a bill that would have denied citizenship to children who do not have at least one us citizen or permanent legal resident as a parent moreover by some measures the farthestreaching laws have had little impact arizonas sb 1070 has reportedly yielded no arrests and enforcement of the portion of the law requiring police officers to check a persons immigration status is being delayed by a court challenge oklahomas hb 1804 was hailed by supporters as the toughest state immigration law in the us in 2007 it barred unauthorized immigrants from receiving state benefits and made transporting them a crime after a year the law had yielded three arrests and one conviction the associated press reported but this is not to say that state and local policies have not had significant effects when prince william county in virginia passed an sb 1070style law in 2008 those embroiled in the debate say it became a very different place it wasnt just that a law was passed all of a sudden people felt threats of violence says film producer chris rigopulos after a screening of 9500 liberty a documentary on the law in arizona an estimated 100000 hispanics left the state in the months after sb 1070 was enacted according to a bbva bancomer research study but according to alicia sandoval who left arizona for ohio this mass exodus was not just because of sb 1070 ms sandoval who came to the us from mexico 10 years ago says the law only formalized what had been going on for years when we first came to arizona there was no fear sandoval says through an interpreter the police wouldnt treat you bad even if you didnt have any papers but that has changed she points to the aggressive policies of maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio who helped deport 26000 people from 2007 to 2010 all before sb 1070 sandoval worked at a bakery in the heavily hispanic phoenix neighborhood and often saw lines of cars pulled over by police officers when she got off work at 1 am she says police would find reasons such as expired tags to pull over people we need some sort of education on how we can be integrated into the community and not be separated from it says sandoval loaddate march 24 2011 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2011 christian science

324 of 997 documents the christian science monitor march 19 2011 saturday immigration reform glimpse of the future in arizona and utah the business community was instrumental in defeating an arizona birthrightcitizenship bill and passing a utah guestworker program suggesting it could be a key force on immigration reform byline daniel b wood staff writer length 786 words the opposite fortunes of two sets of immigration bills this week one in arizona and the other in utah suggest that the business community can play a potentially crucial role in shaping immigration legislation in states nationwide in arizona its opposition to five antiillegal immigration bills including a highprofile attempt to deny children of illegal immigrants birthright citizenship played a pivotal role in turning several republican state senators against the bills which failed thursday meanwhile in utah business groups backed a suite of bills that included a measure to offer twoyear work permits to undocumented immigrants under certain conditions and another to recruit guest workers from mexico the bills were signed into law tuesday at a time when the republican party has taken an increasingly strident position against illegal immigration the two votes both in republicandominated states suggest that the path to compromise on the issue might be through the business community which often has strong ties to gop lawmakers the socalled utah compact for example has highlighted the degree to which businesses law enforcement agencies and community leaders can work together to address the comprehensive realities of immigration and ultimately influence legislative debate at both the state and national levels says catherine wilson a political scientist at villanova university who specializes in immigration issues the utah compact has been hailed as a potential model for compromise on illegal immigration in addition to its provisions on undocumented workers it also requires police to ask suspects arrested in connection with serious crimes about their immigration status it was clearly the salt lake chamber of commerce and businesses more broadly that were driving this bus says mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies in washington a group that favors restricting immigration in short experts say many businesses are wary of hardline antiillegal immigration laws because they create controversy and deny access to cheap labor arizona business rebels some 60 ceos of arizona businesses signed a letter to lawmakers begging them to stop passing harsh antiillegal immigrant laws says angela kelley an immigration expert at the center for american progress a washington think tank she estimates that the backlash against arizonas sb 1070 cost state businesses more than 200 million in lost convention and conference business not including the ripple effect of lost jobs earnings and tax revenue the law required local and state lawenforcement officials to check the immigration status of those they suspected were illegal immigrants though the most controversial aspects have never been implemented because of a legal challenge now in federal court the arizona business community which did not lobby against sb 1070 was instrumental in the defeat of the suite of bills that included the measure to deny birthright citizenship state business leaders say i think the business community here has had a long overdue impact on this says todd landfried spokesman for the arizona employers for immigration reform the people in the business community finally said enough is enough and told the senate president that moving these bills forward now is damaging us at a time when businesses are moving out of the state and people are getting laid off this is not good for the economy or the people of arizona he adds we have to stop this utahs pragmatic approach some hispanic activists say utah is merely attempting to be more practical utah is taking a more pragmatic and economic approach to address the complex and controversial immigration debate says randy ertll executive director of el centro de accion social in pasadena calif they learned from arizona utahs guestworker program for example is a pipeline for cheap temporary labor from latin america this will eventually benefit the utah economy similar to how the bracero program benefited the national us economy by having cheap immigrant labor to work the us agricultural fields from 1942 to 1964 says mr ertll therefore utah is pushing the envelope and adopted george w bushs federal ideology of a guestworker program to be implemented at the state level some experts claim that utahs plan like sb 1070 will not pass constitutional muster because it treads on washingtons turf immigration is a federal issue but utahs willingness to attempt reforms like guestworker programs which are anathema to many conservative republicans is significant says ms kelley it doesnt get any redder than utah loaddate march 20 2011 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2011 christian science publishing society 
151 of 997 documents the record bergen county nj august 14 2007 tuesday all editions newark killings become immigration flash point byline by elizabeth llorente staff writer north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 961 words should local police contact the feds whenever they arrest a crime suspect with an uncertain immigration status the illegal immigrant status and prior record of at least one suspect in the killings of three young adults in newark last week led city councilman ron c rice on monday to call for a resolution requiring city police to contact immigration agents when a felony suspect is deemed to be in the country illegally those who favor strict immigration enforcement say the ability of murder suspect jose carranza an illegal immigrant from peru to roam the streets before the killings despite pending assault and childrape charges underscores the need for stepped up contact between local authorities and immigration agents many say police should routinely check immigration status during the normal course of their work but advocates for immigrants argue that the killings are not an immigration issue and expressed concern that all illegal immigrants would be stigmatized as potential killers this was a heinous crime and these suspects have deep psychological issues said gustavo ramirez head of the passaicbased immigration and american citizenship organization this crime however cannot be explained by immigration status any more than terrorism can be morristown mayor donald cresitello who wants his towns police to be deputized as immigration agents says the involvement of immigration officials after an arrest helps keep dangerous criminals off the streets cresitello said that if the socalled 287g the federal program that deputizes local and state police to enforce immigration matters had been in place in newark and essex county carranza most likely would have remained in custody after previous arrests on assault and rape charges with 287g you get an immigration detainer placed against him and hes not permitted out of the jail cresitello said i dont know why anyone would be against this program carranza 28 had been freed on bail this year on charges of aggravated assault related to a barroom fight and 31 counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child and endangering the welfare of a child last week he and four other suspects including minors are alleged to have killed three college students in executionstyle shootings one of the suspects a 15yearold who essex county officials say is a legal us resident was arrested last week in morristown carranza has pleaded not guilty to charges of firstdegree murder attempted murder and robbery authorities with the essex county prosecutors office say they typically do not contact immigration authorities about an illegal immigrant until after the defendant is convicted thats been the policy said executive assistant prosecutor charlotte smith but we ask for the passport to be seized and no contact with victims one published report attributed the reason for the policy to a concern by essex county authorities that defendants would be deported before they could be punished smith said she could not immediately confirm that concern as the reason for the policy immigration authorities say that essex county authorities did not alert them about carranza until last week we have no record relating to any of his previous arrests said marc raimondi a spokesman for us immigration and customs enforcement in the event that we are contacted regarding an illegal alien who is accused of a violent crime or rape of a child we will put them at the top of our priority list raimondi said that immigration authorities generally wait until after a defendant has served his or her sentence before moving to deport them but he said that immigration does have the power to keep an illegal immigrant from being freed on bail pending the resolution of a case whats more he said immigration authorities still can deport a defendant who has been acquitted bill maer spokesman for the passaic county sheriffs department said the department performs checks on individuals who enter its custody if there is an immigration issue he said the immigration agency is alerted but it is up to federal authorities to decide if theyre going to take action its not our place to enforce immigration law its ices job we just fulfill our obligation to notify them when an issue arises he said immigration advocates generally condemn tight partnerships between local police and immigration agents out of fear that such bonds will lead to abuse of civil rights they also believe that if local and county authorities are viewed as quasiimmigration agents immigrants will be reluctant to come forward as crime victims or witnesses we should not move to deport someone just because they have been accused said ramirez the immigrant advocate people can be and often are wrongly accused and we should give them their day in court after theyve been found guilty of something horrible then lets punish them and bring in immigration and deport them for his part rice who is pushing for the immigration resolution in newark said he does not want his proposal to be seen as a call to arms against illegal immigrants i want to address the problem of getting people off the streets like jose carranza he said i dont want to deputize local police officers i think that goes too far i dont want racial profiling fast facts roughly 500000 illegal immigrants are believed to be living in new jersey about 12 million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the united states more than half of all illegal immigrants are said to have entered the country lawfully but overstayed visas

council of la raza told journalists and students at the heartland conference at the university of oklahoma dan stein president of the federation for american immigration reform said his organization has helped craft most of the state laws that have been debated recently including arizonas immigration law steins group has called for tighter controls on immigrants coming to the us and coordination of all government agencies to track immigrants theres a need to have a partnership with the executive branch to carry out immigration laws stein said these state laws are about trying to carve out terms and put political pressure to do more the arizona law that went into effect last year is considered the toughest and most restrictive in the us it is being contested in federal court don kerwin of the migration policy institute said there is a risk of creating a permanent underclass in the us and multitudes of scattered state laws are worse than the status quo he said the federal government is deporting more than 400000 immigrants a year nationally its overstating it to say the federal government is not enforcing the laws kerwin said it is not legitimate to say the federal government cant establish priorities state senators tackle the debate several oklahoma proposals could be rolled into house bill 1446 legislation that would allow law enforcement to determine the legal status of those they stop sen ralph shortey roklahoma city campaigned on strengthening immigration laws in oklahoma and is a member of the joint committee on immigration one of his bills would require undocumented students to pay nonresident tuition rates at state colleges and universities shortey said it isnt fair for undocumented students to pay inresident rates when citizen students from other states like texas cant the ultimate goal is to make these people realize theyre not wanted here and to leave our state said shortey my native american heritage prompts me to protect what we have shortey said some american indians he speaks to as well as other constituents see they are losing the country again the freshman senator added he feels morally obligated to uphold and protect federal immigration laws recent census data shows the hispanic population in the state now tops the number of american indians here senate minority leader sen andrew rice doklahoma city said he fears proposals like shorteys would alienate legal immigrant communities and push illegal immigrants further underground this foments tension between classes and races of people and isnt a productive way to address the issue he said this will affect our state in ways we wont like said rice who used an example of phoenixs declining convention business because of the states controversial immigration law that went into effect last year rice said immigration isnt an easy issue to tackle but the majority of the immigrants here want to contribute and become a part of their communities oklahoma values are to do what it takes to provide for your family rice said stereotyping seen in issue martinez de castro said the immigration debate is negative and often stereotyped she said seven of 10 hispanic people in the us are legal that jumps to nine out of 10 among those younger than 18 part of the discussion of immigration is over demographic change and cultural change and latinos are part of that equation she said panelists spoke about needing ongoing evaluations of the labor market needs but a couple warned of watching civil and human rights our immigration laws are generous but do they allow for basic human rights kerwin said we are still separating families after petitions are heard jerry kammer of the center for immigration studies said about 1 million immigrants are granted residency

330 of 997 documents the washington times march 3 2011 thursday kick out criminal aliens mythical racism in immigration enforcement byline by rep lamar smith special to the washington times section b commentary pg 1 length 851 words there has been a major shift toward proenforcement policies in the united states diminishing the prospect of amnesty for illegal immigrants critics of proenforcement policies allege that is antiimmigrant but that couldnt be further from the truth favoring the rule of law isnt meanspirited or racist it is the very foundation of the united states and is at the core of why america can welcome immigrants we have by far the most generous legal immigration system in the world admitting 1 million immigrants each year that has always been a net benefit for the united states however illegal immigration puts a strain on our economy schools and hospitals and even poses serious national security threats enforcing all of our laws including immigration laws is critical to our success and sovereignty as a nation immigration laws do not discriminate against individuals based on their color creed gender or ethnic background instead the law makes a distinction between lawkeepers and lawbreakers a crime is a crime no matter who commits it many proenforcement policies actually would reduce discrimination take everify for example this remarkably successful program enables companies to hire legal workers by verifying the social security numbers provided by new employees everify does not ask ethnicity or race it simply makes sure the persons name date of birth and social security number or alien identification number match if they do the process is over if they dont and the person has a legal right to work in the united states the employee then has an opportunity to resolve the discrepancy which most do successfully within a few days everify opens up job opportunities for citizens and legal immigrants by turning off the jobs magnet that encourages illegal immigration if illegal immigrants can no longer live and work in the united states many will simply return home voluntarily and taxpayer dollars will be saved according to the federation for american immigration reform illegal immigration costs american taxpayers 113 billion annually this amounts to 1117 per household to pay for the health care education welfare and incarceration of illegal immigrants illegal immigration drains states budgets too california is expected to have a 25 billion budget shortfall by june 2012 at the same time illegal immigration costs the golden state nearly 22 billion each year if immigration laws were fully enforced californias budget deficit would nearly be eliminated proenforcement supporters believe it is wrong for americans to bear these exorbitant costs by reducing the flow of illegal immigrants into the united states we can reduce the financial burden on american taxpayers critics say proenforcement policies harm the republican partys future with hispanic voters but the facts prove otherwise the november midterm election results repudiated the openborders philosophy and revealed a promising future for the republican party exit polls showed 38 percent of hispanic voters cast ballots for house republican candidates this historically high level of hispanic support for republican candidates came despite widespread preelection claims by advocates for illegal immigration that a new arizona immigration law and a proruleoflaw stand would undercut hispanic support for republicans those against the proenforcement movement also use inaccurate generalizations insinuating that hispanic voters support amnesty in fact many hispanic voters support efforts to enforce our immigration laws republican latino candidates in florida new mexico and nevada all of which have large hispanic populations won statewide races while calling for enhanced border security and enforcement of immigration laws instead of amnesty the proenforcement movement is not strictly republican it is american and it is not antihispanic it is proruleoflaw time and again american voters have overwhelmingly defeated amnesty attempts including the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform and last years push for the dream act to attract even more hispanic voters in the future republicans should continue to emphasize our shared values of economic opportunity national security and education the united states was founded upon the rule of law and proenforcement policies uphold this american legacy the internal revenue service enforces tax law even though the majority of americans do not enjoy paying taxes why because all americans are required to play by the same rules the same goes for immigration laws amnesty sends the message to illegal immigrants and illegal bordercrossers that we do not take our immigration laws seriously that undoubtedly would lead to unsustainable levels of illegal immigration we are a nation of immigrants but in order to sustain the high levels of legal immigration we have immigration laws must be enforced allowing millions to evade our laws is unfair and hurts american workers and taxpayers

length 981 words immigration is poised to be a heated issue this year with oklahoma lawmakers proposing nearly 30 bills ranging from restricting property rights of noncitizens to requiring school officials know the legal status of students an analysis by the oklahoman of bills filed shows a number of education and law enforcement issues relating to undocumented immigrants lawmakers also have formed a joint committee to tackle the subject the committee will look at all of oklahomas policies and consider ideas that will benefit our state said jarred brejka spokesman for senate pro tem brian bingman rsapulpa snowclogged streets and canceled work days at the legislature postponed meetings but goals and timelines are still in the works brejka said so far there are a lot of ideas to consider some proposed bills are not complete and contain little more than a title or section of the law being addressed more information and details could be added to these bills during the legislative session which ends in may titles include the immigration policy improvement act and the oklahoma illegal immigration act other proposed legislation is more developed the interstate compact for birth certificates act takes up the issue of birthright citizenship and anchor babies establishing citizenship requirements and laying out protocols for issuing birth certificates to babies born in the united states several bills would have schools identify undocumented students one would allow school districts to charge students not lawfully present in the country others would prohibit them from resident tuition with words echoing the arizona immigration law enacted last year one piece of legislation would allow law enforcement with reasonable suspicion that a person is an alien to determine the persons immigration status yet another would allow relatives of deported immigrants to be investigated and if appropriate removed from the country of more than a handful of filed bills relating to law enforcement one would allow the state department of corrections to issue arrest warrants for anyone who illegally returns to the country and isnt currently in prison one bill addresses unauthorized immigrants and population counts for congressional redistricting another would disallow the rent or purchase of property by illegal immigrants nearly 20 bills have been proposed by rep randy terrill rmoore and senate newcomer ralph shortey r oklahoma city shortey is a member of the joint immigration reform committee terrill is not many issues to be considered immigration joint committee cochair sen ron justice rchickasha said compromises wont be easy in the often emotional immigrationreform debate justice seven legislators and the attorney general are a part of the committee he said there are federal issues state lawmakers cant fix jumping to conclusions and making hasty decisions will only inflame the rancor i think anytime we pass legislation we have to be mindful of other things that can be affected he said sometimes there are unintended consequences and we have to keep that in mind douglas stump an oklahoma city immigration attorney and executive committee member of the american immigration lawyers association cautioned lawmakers to be careful when considering legislation the concept that states want to get involved in immigration is understandable in light of the federal governments gridlock on the subject stump said however having a patchwork of state laws is leading to chaos overall and to isolation of the states that take the harsher views laws that have landed states in court such as arizona and oklahomas immigration laws cost taxpayers draw law enforcement and the courts away from serious crimes and can harm police officers relationships in immigrant communities he said oklahoma has fewer undocumented immigrants than most states but politicians here have built careers around the issue they do nothing to really address the problem stump said many are beginning to question whether some of these legislative efforts are a gimmick to garner votes and revenue for the proponents of the legislation in the absence of federal reform more people are speaking out and local interests are being forced to step up try things out and see what sticks said sgt shannon clark coordinator of the tulsa county 287 g federal immigration program the program is a joint effort with federal immigration officials to identify detain and remove illegal immigrants you can honestly say every county and municipality in the state has had to deal with illegal immigration in some capacity clark said but if the legislature is going to make policies they have to make an effort to educate police officers clark has played an active role in the law enforcement community educating officers about the roles they play in immigration enforcement and resources that are available he helped train officers following the passage of house bill 1804 oklahomas antiimmigration law we can make all the rules and laws we want but if law enforcement doesnt know how to enforce them its almost not worth the debate clark said states attention is on immigration the number of state laws relating to immigration peaked in 2007 declined in 2008 and rose again in 2009 data from the national conference of state legislatures show in 2010 more than 1400 bills were proposed and 208 laws were enacted by 46 state legislatures and the district of columbia ann morse program director for the immigration policy project at the national conference of

334 of 997 documents the atlanta journalconstitution january 18 2011 tuesday main edition gingreys immigration numbers dont add up byline willoughby mariano staff section metro news pg 1b length 940 words us rep phil gingrey wants georgians to know that even a trickle of immigration can lead to a deluge the marietta republican explained just how bad he thinks it can get during a state legislative committee meeting on immigration speaking via a video conference transmission from washington on dec 16 he put blame on the shoulders of national immigration policy and so now under the policy our immigration policy literally one person with a green card can bring in in the extreme 279 people that sounds like a lot is this true immigration became a central issue during the election season when nowgov nathan deal and his democratic foe former gov roy barnes both called for an arizonastyle immigration law that states decision to take a more active role enforcing federal laws prompted the us department of justice to file suit against it we called gingreys office for evidence a staffer referred us to numbersusa a nonprofit group that advocates for lower immigration levels roy beck the groups executive director said he did not know of any cases where this happened but he emphasized its possible through chain migration thats when immigrants take advantage of us rules that allow them to bring their relatives here foreigners who obtain green cards can apply to the us citizenship and immigration services to bring their spouses and unmarried children if they become citizens and are over age 21 they can also apply to bring in their married children parents and siblings we checked numbersusas math the group used immigration rules and fertility rates for lessdeveloped countries to determine that 273 relatives of a legal immigrant can follow him during the next 15 years gingrey said 279 but we wont count this slight difference against him because gingrey said such immigration was possible in the extreme we accepted the groups assumptions such as that in recent years families in the lessdeveloped world have on average three children and that all of an immigrants eligible family members would leave for the us and become citizens as soon as they could legally do so we also assumed there were absolutely no visa processing waits and that immigration backlogs do not exist we found numbersusas estimate was not based on literally one person with a green card entering the country as gingrey said their estimate assumes that the first immigrant comes here as a worker with his spouse and three children this roughly doubles its estimate we also found that immigration researchers generally agree that in the real world such largescale immigration is at least extremely unlikely if not impossible jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies which advocates for lower immigration levels is critical of chain migration but she noted that administrative wait times and quotas can make such largescale migration difficult she had not heard of a case where this has happened karen woodrowlafield who studies immigration as a professor at the maryland population research center at the university of maryland noted those same problems she said such numbers are not possible under the current immigration system because of visa application backlogs atlantas uscis field office now takes four or five months to process immigration documents in california the processing time for us citizens to bring in siblings is more than four years crystal williams executive director of the american immigration lawyers association a national association of attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law said her group also determined that numbersusas figures are not possible her group supports the us justice departments suit against arizona if people could bring in those numbers they would have williams said but they didnt us law sets yearly quotas on legal permanent residents and caps the percentage of potential immigrants from a particular country to 7 percent this means waits that can last for decades for instance filipino siblings of us residents who applied for visas before jan 1 1988 are only just beginning to be interviewed for entry according to the us state department for countries without backlogs the date is jan 1 2002 in reality chainmigration numbers are much lower experts who study chain migration told us over a span of 20 years immigrants who came in on employment visas in 1971 brought in an average of one resident more recently one researcher found that on average one foreign citizen brings in 21 others under family reunification rules and another study shows only some 10 percent of immigrants who got their green cards in 2003 petitioned to bring a relative to the us so what does this mean gingrey said that literally one person with a green card could bring in more than 270 others in the extreme but we found his figure was not based on one person its based on a family of five we found this scenario is likely impossible under quotas established under current immigration policy quotas mean it can take years even decades merely processing immigration documents can take months if not years given that recent data show that the average immigrant brings in 21 others in his lifetime gingrey could easily

152 of 997 documents the record bergen county nj july 23 2007 monday all editions bogota cops could gain power over immigrants byline by elizabeth llorente staff writer north jersey media group section local pg l01 length 933 words bogota mayor steve lonegan one of the states most vocal proponents for a hard line on immigration says he may apply for a federal program that deputizes local police to enforce immigration laws lonegan says that although illegal immigration is not a burning issue in his onesquaremile borough federally deputized police officers would serve as a deterrent to wouldbe bogota residents who are living in the united states unlawfully morristown mayor donald cresitello has received national attention as he awaits a decision by the us department of homeland security on his proposal to have his local police admitted into the socalled 287g program this comes at a time when local officials across the country increasingly are making moves to address illegal immigration citing the failure of national political leaders to reform the flawed immigration system we dont have a day laborer problem like other towns in bergen county lonegan said but we have tough loitering laws and that discourages day laborers if 287g will help bogota and the quality of life here if the message people get is that if you come to bogota to live in an illegal rental unit you might end up getting deported then 287g makes total common sense to me representatives from groups that favor strict immigration enforcement have met with bogotas police chief and business administrator the business administrator pat obrien declined to comment the police chief was said to be on vacation and could not be reached law enforcement agencies at local county and state levels who are deputized to enforce immigration laws get access to an immigration database where they can check an immigrants status and other information these deputized authorities can then detain a person for immigration violations and begin deportation proceedings against them agencies in about a dozen states are part of the 287g program but only two police departments in new hampshire and virginia have been admitted into it some 75 agencies at all levels of government have applications pending for admission said michael gilhooly a spokesman for us immigration and customs enforcement the agency within homeland security that runs 287g about 20000 people have been placed in deportation proceedings as a result of arrests linked to 287g gilhooly said lonegan suspects that unlawful immigrants burden the school system and contribute to his boroughs growing number of illegal rental units he said that while tenants can be reimbursed for rent paid to an unscrupulous landlord some have not come forward to collect and just vanished lonegans interest in deputizing the boroughs police as immigration agents drew support from new jersey groups that favor tough immigration enforcement but condemnation from immigration advocates federal immigration authorities cant be everywhere said gayle kesselman cochairwoman of the carlstadtbased new jersey citizens for immigration control this isnt about doing sweeps in a town it just forms a partnership between local police and the federal government so that local police can act to enforce the law of the land cresitello the morristown mayor said that the lack of a federal solution to the broken immigration system leaves local officials little choice its more important now than ever for local municipalities to do this said cresitello even if congress had done something to deal with illegal immigration the local level is where a lot of it would have to be enforced but others say the issue is a federal matter and should remain the responsibility of mainly the federal government they say deputizing local police as immigration agents will alienate them from their immigrant community members they also question the motives of lonegan who has locked horns with immigration advocates and hispanic community leaders in recent years in 2006 he tried to force the removal of a spanishlanguage mcdonalds billboard that advertised its iced coffee he also attempted unsuccessfully to have english designated the towns official language through an ordinance that would have required all borough business to be conducted in english unless mandated differently by state or federal law if you want to disempower a community you start by aiming for its weakest link said cid wilson a leonia resident and past president of the dominican american national roundtable he aims for illegal immigrants but then legal immigrants and even us citizens of certain ethnicities im a us citizen and hispanic and his campaign against mcdonalds advertisement in spanish offended me that had nothing to do with illegal immigration borough councilwoman yesenia frias vowed to fight any effort by lonegan to deputize police to enforce immigration laws if he tries to really initiate this i will get every single hispanic in this town together and other immigrants from haiti africa asia everywhere to oppose it his fight against mcdonalds and now this just causes a lot of division among people in this town lonegan balks at charges that his actions are rooted in discrimination or that they are antihispanic i am just trying to learn about 287g talk to other towns that have done it to see how it is working he said it appears to be a commonsense enhancement of the polices ability to do their work i come from an immigrant family i believe we

337 of 997 documents the washington times december 9 2010 thursday obamas immigration twostep president doesnt mind patchwork enforcement in sanctuary cities byline by rep gary g miller special to the washington times section b commentary pg 3 length 745 words the federal government has failed to stem our nations illegalimmigration and bordersecurity problems and as a result state and local governments have been forced to bear the responsibility and costs associated with this dereliction of duty because of that arizona earlier this year passed and signed into law the support our law enforcement and safe neighborhoods act to better equip its law enforcement officers to protect citizens and legal immigrants residing in the grand canyon state although opponents have spun the intent and effects of the bill in actuality the arizona immigration law mirrors federal law which already requires aliens to register and carry their documents with them arizonas law simply states that violating federal immigration law is a state crime as well because illegal immigrants are by definition in violation of federal immigration laws under the new provisions they can be arrested by local law enforcement in arizona despite these facts the department of justice under the obama administration has sued arizona in the lawsuit challenging the arizona statute justice officials argue although states may exercise their police power in a manner that has an incidental or indirect effect on aliens a state may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with the federal immigration laws the constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country a patchwork of immigration enforcement while i would argue the arizona law does not constitute a patchwork of immigration enforcement it appears the administrations definition is limited in scope for if a patchwork were its primary concern the obama administration would be suing sanctuary cities as well under current law it is illegal for state and local governments to prevent their police forces from communicating with federal immigration enforcement authorities nonetheless many local governments have adopted sanctuary city policies that explicitly prevent their police officers from cooperating with us immigration and customs enforcement ice agents when local governments refuse to share information with federal immigration authorities police departments often arrest criminal aliens only to release them without ever checking their immigration status as a result instead of being deported many of those aliens move on to commit additional and sometimes more serious criminal offenses although sanctuary cities deliberately disregard our nations immigration law by refusing to hand over illegal immigrants to federal authorities they have hypocritically begged to be reimbursed for the cost of jailing illegal immigrants the obama administration has not challenged these illegal policies in court and it has doled out millions of taxpayer dollars to sanctuary cities to compensate for the cost of jailing illegal immigrants in fact in 2010 nearly 63 million has been awarded to 27 jurisdictions widely considered to be sanctuary jurisdictions according to the center for immigration studies apparently if you are a sanctuary city you can have your cake and eat it too rather than limited federal dollars being awarded to those jurisdictions that make a mockery of our nations immigration laws these funds should be allocated only to those local law enforcement agencies that cooperate with the federal government to this extent i have authored legislation that would prohibit sanctuary cities from receiving both justice and department of homeland security funds but this is beside the point if the administration is serious about making sure we have a uniform immigration policy it needs to go after sanctuary cities this would be consistent policy however justice has stated that it will not prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions rather the administration has rewarded sanctuary jurisdictions with federal dollars set aside for the same policies they deliberately ignore as a result of these actions we can gather that the obama administrations definition for patchwork of immigration enforcement is limited to those who seek to enforce federal immigration law and does not encompass those who seek to undermine it for the sake of consistency and the safety of our communities it is time to end the double standard rep gary g miller is a republican from california loaddate december 9 2010 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2010 the washington times llc all rights reserved this document could not be formatted for delivery if your delivery request

343 of 997 documents the denver post october 24 2010 sunday final edition election 2010 the candidates views on immigration if i were governor in the weeks before the nov 2 election the denver post is asking colorados three gubernatorial candidates to respond to a series of questions on some critical issues this week they were asked to respond to this question on immigration would you support an arizonatype immigration law in colorado if not what would you propose to help staunch the flow of illegal immigrants in colorado and to deal with those already here section perspective pg d01 length 1209 words federal reform a must by john hickenlooper i understand the frustration so many people in colorado feel because of the federal governments failure to act on this issue concern over immigration is dividing our country its a problem we must solve yet congress has failed to act because politicians on both sides republicans and democrats think they have something to gain form perpetuating immigration as a wedge issue but individual state or local policies will never be a substitute for comprehensive bipartisan federal reform the arizona association of chiefs of police opposed arizonas law out of concern for the costs and public safety a law like arizonas would mean skyrocketing costs for local law enforcement agencies courts prisons and ultimately colorado taxpayers im not inclined to place another unfunded mandate on our local communities for a problem that should be solved by the federal government instead i would work with governors across the country to form a coalition demanding federal immigration reform most of us already agree on four basic tenets of a sound immigration policy we need to secure our borders we need an identification system that is reliable and secure we need a guestworker program to protect our farmers ranchers and other industries and we need to hold businesses accountable and responsible once these measures are in place colorado already has some of the nations toughest immigration laws unlike arizonas law parts of which were struck down colorados immigration laws have not been challenged in court in 2006 our legislature led by a bipartisan coalition required local law enforcement officials to support federal immigration authorities when illegal immigrants are arrested for criminal activity or jailed under my administration denver has twice officially certified to the state that it is in compliance with the law if elected governor i would continue to ensure compliance with all of these laws i support participating in the secure communities initiative which takes fingerprints from anyone booked into jail and runs them against fbi and homeland security records we need to identify arrest and deport dangerous criminals who are here illegally finally because some people will always play political games with a wedge issue ill give you the facts about my record objective sources have repeatedly found that denver follows colorados tough immigration law the citys law enforcement agencies have reported more than 7300 arrestees to immigration and customs enforcement since 2006 facts like that are why the denver post recently wrote denvers no sanctuary city say no to amesty dan maes for too long washington has sat on its hands as neither political party has been willing to make the tough choices when it comes to illegal immigration the influx of illegal immigrants has taken a massive toll on our state services and its time we get serious about taking it on and that includes saying no to amnesty federal inaction has led to great consternation among many across this state and nation and the arizona immigration law is a natural extension of that anger and frustration while the law isnt perfect it does offer law enforcement some additional tools to help enforce immigration laws and for that reason i absolutely support something similar here in the centennial state additionally i support the secure communities program a national initiative that helps to bridge some of the gaps in immigration enforcement through information sharing and digital recordkeeping at its core the program seeks to deport immigrants who commit crimes as quickly and efficiently as possible regardless of our individual feelings on immigration certainly removing criminal immigrants is something everyone can agree is a priority but as much as those laws and programs could help stem the tide of illegal immigration the most important step we should take is perhaps the easiest if we can prevent employers from hiring immigrants we cut off demand and help to end illegal immigration at its roots everify is a free service that businesses can use to make certain theyre hiring legal workers and we need to take a serious look at implementing it statewide everify has already done wonders in state government and at the municipal levels and a broadbased expansion would be cheap effective and entirely feasible our social services and education system are nearing a breaking point and theres no question illegal immigration is much to blame with the coming wave of new conservative leadership in washington there is renewed hope for a positive antiamnesty solution at the federal level but until the feds take meaningful action states need to do everything in their power to address the issue locally through everify programs like secure communities and new tougher laws colorado can take three very important steps in that direction ariztype laws work tom tancredo yes i strongly support arizonastyle laws to deal with a problem created by the federal governments lack of enforcement of our nations immigration laws colorado has an estimated 200000 or more illegal immigrants who drain over 16 billion in taxpayer dollars annually according to a recent study by the federation for american immigration reform colorado spends over 50 million alone on prosecuting and incarcerating criminal immigrants beginning in 2004 arizona enacted a series of referenda and state laws on this matter and sb 1070 is only the most recent the most controversial part of the new arizona law has been put on hold by a federal district judge but many legal experts say it will ultimately be upheld in fact coloradobased mountain states legal foundation has filed an amicus brief in support of it that provision makes it a state crime to be in arizona unlawfully and gives local law enforcement the authority to ask for the same immigration documents that are already required by federal law arizonas new sb 1070 law contains one provision already enacted in colorado in 2006 a law prohibiting sanctuary city policies however that colorado statute sb 06090 needs to be more vigorously enforced denver for example has not lost one dollar of state funding for its failure to enforce the law despite its police training bulletin of september 2006 basically telling denver police officers they can ignore it working with the general assembly i will support strong enforcement of existing laws aimed at illegal immigrants and will sign new legislation on the arizona model if passed by the legislature moreover i will ask other governors across the nation republican and democrat to join me in demanding federal enforcement of our immigration laws and immediate action to secure our borders

347 of 997 documents deseret morning news salt lake city october 9 2010 saturday utah delegates discuss immigration reform byline jamshid ghazi askar deseret news length 1541 words salt lake city the ongoing debate in utah about immigration reform is primed to kick up yet another dust storm before years end when several bills pertaining to immigration are introduced in the state legislature but to give adequate context to any analysis of statebased efforts to reform immigration law one must first recognize that immigration is a fundamentally federal issue although a strong undertow of debate about whether states have any business legislating immigration is permeating both the federal courts and the public square on the heels of arizonas enactment of its own immigration bill nobodys arguing that immigration reform is first and foremost the responsibility of the federal government which leads to the proverbial elephant in the room at a time when immigration is the hottest of hotbutton topics in the beehive state why hasnt utahs congressional delegation parlayed the concerns if its constituents into any kind of palpable immigration reform to find answers to that question the deseret news contacted the five members of utahs congressional delegation sens orrin hatch and bob bennett as well as reps jim matheson rob bishop and jason chaffetz hatch and the three representatives took time to answer questions and share insights about immigration reform bennett whose 18year tenure as the states junior senator is ending did not respond to interview requests to their credit each of the four respondents offered salient articulate insight into the complexities of washingtons inability to address immigration nobody proffered silverbullet explanations for why immigration policy is broken or how to immediately fix it but the amalgamation of their various viewpoints provides a threedimensional world view of the challenges that lay ahead their varied explanations about the institutional failure of congress to reform immigration law include references to a new immigration bill in the senate the terrorist attacks of 911 partisan politics border security a 19th century english author and a comedy central comedian ironically the one thing the quartet most strongly agrees with each other about is that congress definitely should have done something about immigration by now the insider hatchs nearly 34 years in the senate afford him impeccable credentials im hardly a johnnycomelately on immigration issues hatch said in an email i am and always have been actively involved in tackling illegal immigration i have taken the initiative to increase immigration enforcement in utah including bringing immigration and customs enforcement ice quickresponse teams to our state creating an immigration court and establishing an ice field office director position to address our states immigration concerns i also brought the 287g crossdeputizing program and recently helped bring the secure communities program to utah youd be hardpressed to find somebody who has done more on immigration enforcement for utah than i have done he lays much of the blame for the current stalemate on federal immigration reform on democrats democrats are in control of congress and certainly carry the lions share of the blame hatch said for example throughout this congress the democrats have tried to create buzz around a flawed bill they know will never pass in an effort to get more people out to vote thats just pathetic really you cant play political football on something this important the problem doesnt end with congress the obama administration is also playing politics with immigration to expand its liberal base on sept 29 hatch gave a glimpse into how he thinks immigration reform should proceed when he introduced the strengthening our commitment to legal immigration and americas security act among other things the bill seeks to mandate increased cooperation between local law enforcement and ice agents as well as forbid members of known gang or criminal organizations from receiving visas to come to the us while utah is not a border state the immigration problems we face are a residual effect of a porous border hatch said i dare say that many states across the nation are in a similar situation that is why i introduced this bill to shed light on some very serious issues that have been overlooked for too long the veteran currently seeking reelection for a sixth term matheson is the only democrat among utahs delegation and the most senior of the three utahns in the house of representatives with nearly a decade of service on capitol hill matheson can contextualize the source and cause of the current uproar over immigration for example he believes the federal government hasnt reformed immigration because of the 911 terrorist attacks i think that there was a certain level of momentum moving in the direction of addressing this issue when i first got in office in 2001 mathson said i think that momentum was stopped by the sept 11 attacks at that point it was no longer an agenda item in washington and in fact after sept 11 a number of restrictions were put in on for example the guest worker programs that in some ways made it more challenging for folks to play by the rules i think that was clearly a moment that affected the issue and really took it off the table without exempting his own party from criticism matheson blames partisan politics for sidetracking the immigration issue both political parties he said have got to stop leveraging this issue for the next election his threepart plan for fixing immigration includes increased enforcement for the use of everify a tool employers can use to confirm the immigration status of a prospective worker strengthening border security and improving the guestworker program that allows immigrants to legally come work in the united states under the proviso they will eventually return home there are very credible pragmatic nonideological steps that could be taken on this issue matheson said that i would like to think that people in congress and members of both parties could reach consensus on those issues the pragmatist bishop feels any discussion of a comprehensive plan to reform existing immigration law would be an exercise in futility until the united states can secure its border with mexico i think securing the border is the most important step because its the first step that has to take place before you can solve any other issue bishop said if the tub is overflowing the first thing you do is turn off the water not figure out where to put the water theres the old saying by lewis carroll that paraphrasing says if you do first things first second things will be added to it if you do second things first youll accomplish neither first nor second things which is why the first thing that has to be there is border security he asserts that border patrol agents are severely inhibited from protecting the border by archeological laws endangered species areas and historic laws that exist only on federal lands and prohibit border agents limitations which illegal bordercrossers knowingly use to their advantage to that end bishop is cosponsoring house bill 5016 which would free border patrol agents from those and other restrictions border patrol does a great job on private property where by law they have total access to meet their needs he said its only on federal property that the federal border patrol is prohibited by federal land managers from actually being able to do their jobs and thats what has to stop the true believer congress has totally ignored this problem and its a shame because everyone knows its broken and it has to be fixed chaffetz said for those of us that want to be part of the solution its terribly frustrating sitting on the house subcommittee on immigration challenges chaffetzs patience he reached a bit of a breaking point last month when he skipped the immigration subcommittee meeting wherein stephen colbert the comedy central funny man who chaffetz once legwrestled on the colbert report television show appeared before the subcommittee to offer ostensibly faux testimony about immigration issues ive been on the immigration subcommittee for 21 months and before stephen colbert the subcommittee had only met 10 times he said never did we actually mark up a substantive immigration bill never i have sponsored or cosponsored 12 pieces of immigration legislation and yet none of it has ever come up before the subcommittee thats whats frustrating like matheson chaffetz also has his own threepart plan enforce current laws secure the border and rectify a broken immigration system unlike matheson though chaffez blames only the democrats for the political gridlock keeping immigration reform from happening democrats dont seem to have time for worthwhile bills that are done in a bipartisan way he said i think thats why house speaker nancy pelosi is about to get fired hopefully if leadership changes in the house hopefully that will change in the immigration subcommittee as

348 of 997 documents st petersburg times florida october 8 2010 friday politifactcom edition spanish language ad claims sen barbara boxer voted against immigration reform byline robert farley section politifact length 1138 words sen barbara boxer voted against immigration reform to permit hispanic immigrants people to come here legally to work susan b anthony list on thursday september 30th 2010 in a tv ad the ruling false susan b anthony list and the national organization for marriage ad our values our senator nuestros valores nuestra senadora a new spanish language ad from the susan b anthony list a republican group that opposes abortion and the national organization for marriage which opposes gay marriage attacks sen barbara boxer dcalif on its core issues saying that boxer doesnt share our values because she supports abortion and homosexual marriage the ad running on spanish language tv in several large california markets also attacks boxer on immigration saying she voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work its a surprising attack given that boxer is a wellknown advocate for comprehensive immigration reform boxer has long favored tougher border security but she has also advocated a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the united states asked for backup for the ads claim about boxer a spokesman for sba list pointed us toward a may 23 2007 story in the new york times that notes boxers opposition to a guest worker provision proposed for the comprehensive immigration reform initiative that year according to the story senator barbara boxer democrat of california denounced the guest worker program saying it would create a pool of desperate lowwage workers whom employers could easily exploit the guest worker program proposed in the 2007 immigration bill was part of the negotiated grand bargain that sought to get bipartisan support for the bill the program would have allowed temporary visas for several hundred thousand immigrants to fill unskilled jobs the visas could be renewed twice so long as the guest worker returned to his home country for at least a year between visits and to return the worker would need sponsorship from an employer many immigration advocates feared it would create an environment where employers could abuse guest workers because they could control whether that guest worker could return and boxer voted to eliminate it a may 29 2007 editorial in the new york times described the guest worker provision in the bill as an absurd employment hokeypokey you put your two years in then one year out then repeat that twice and go home forever it would be massive indentured servitude colonial times all over again but without any hope of citizenship for those taking our most difficult and despised jobs the ad doesnt explain any of this background it merely says boxer voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work in fact boxer has long been a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform in 2006 she voted for an immigration reform package that included a more immigrantfriendly temporary guest worker provision in addition while she voted against the version of the guest worker provision included in the 2007 immigration reform bill she ultimately voted to continue debating the bill although it subsequently died boxers campaign also notes that she cosponsored the agjobs act of 2009 to allow illegal immigrants who work in the fields to get temporary visas and eventually a path to permanent residency and in april 2010 boxer and 15 other senators sent a letter to president barack obama expressing support for a bipartisan immigration reform bill this year marc rosenblum senior policy analyst at the migration policy institute said the ad suggests she has been an antiimmigration vote in congress and thats not accurate she voted against that piece of it mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration said the ad is clearly intended to convey that shes against what advocates call comprehensive immigration reform when in fact shes all for the leftwing version of it what she voted against was the third leg of comprehensive immigration reform which is insisted on by the business and libertarian right which is the increased importation of captive labor via guestworker programs the immigration attack on boxer doesnt come completely from left field trailing badly in polls among californias latino voters republican carly fiorina who has backed arizonas controversial immigration law has used similar criticisms of boxer in an attempt to weaken the democrat with latino voters according to an oct 6 2010 story in the los angeles times though fiorina has revealed little about how she would approach immigration issues she has sharply criticized boxer for seeking to strip a proposed temporary worker program from federal immigration legislation in 2007 that ultimately collapsed in the senate we think the ads claim about boxers record on immigration is highly misleading it states simply that boxer voted against immigration reform to permit our people to come here legally to work boxer did not vote against the immigration reform bill in 2007 she voted against a provision in it that she felt would lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers moreover the ad ignores boxers history of support for comprehensive immigration reform including a program to allow immigrants to come to the united states to work legally we rate the ads claim about boxers immigration record false about this statement published friday october 8th 2010 at 1004 am subjects

358 of 997 documents the washington times august 18 2010 wednesday court dismisses state role federal government already allows local immigration enforcement byline by asa hutchinson special to the washington times section b commentary pg 1 length 854 words i was disappointed in president obamas challenge to arizonas hotly debated immigration law and judge susan boltons preliminary ruling to argue that it is unconstitutional for local law enforcement to be a legitimate partner in immigration enforcement is shortsighted it is evidence of a lack of commitment to securing our borders and a lack of appreciation for the proper role of the states in supporting federal law enforcement priorities the administration challenged the arizona law because immigration enforcement is the province of the federal government and federal law trumps state law while i agree with this constitutional principle the federal government has not exclusively preempted the states role in immigration enforcement in fact the federal government has encouraged a greater partnership with the state and it should continue to do so as the former undersecretary for border and transportation security at the department of homeland security i made the case that us immigration and customs enforcement ice does not have the manpower or resources to do the job alone there are about 12 million illegal immigrants in the country and only about 6000 ice agents obviously our efforts will be more effective if we can partner federal law enforcements limited resources with the vaster resources of state and local organizations around the country this is why we promoted something known as 287g passed by congress in 1996 as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act in short 287g encourages partnerships between federal and statelocal law enforcement to tackle the problem of illegal immigration the program was and remains quite successful though the current administration has greatly curtailed the approval of new agreements with states that would allow for such partnerships nonetheless there are 63 jurisdictions in 20 states including arizona that already have partnership agreements with ice the joint agreements require that ice provide training including training to protect the civil rights of individuals and prevent profiling they also require that ice agents supervise local officers when they are engaged in immigration enforcement activity to suggest that immigration is the exclusive domain of the federal government disallowing partnerships with local law enforcement defies the will of congress not to mention reality numerous local jurisdictions have laws on the books dealing with immigration in a variety of ways historically there is a presumption that the legitimate police powers of the states are not to be preempted by federal law unless congress has made that purpose clear when congress has been an active partner in promoting state and local enforcement partnerships as in the case of immigration there should be no real preemption debate clearly the problem of illegal immigration is not being addressed to the extent it needs to be addressed in arizona when gov jan brewer signed sb 1070 into law authorizing the states local law enforcement to enforce immigration law she made clear that the state of arizona was doing so because the federal government had failed to do so there are plenty of examples of federalstate partnerships that deal with a variety of law enforcement challenges these could be used as models for similar partnerships regarding immigration for instance joint drug enforcement task forces comprising federal state and local law enforcement to combat illicit drugs including drugs being smuggled across us borders are common no single entity has exclusive jurisdiction the enforcement efforts are shared another model is the joint terrorism task forces established to combat terrorism in this case there is a clear lead agency the fbi however as the department of justice asserts on its website the task forces comprise the resources of federal state and local law enforcement without allowing for such partnerships between states and the federal government on the issue of immigration there can be no serious argument that we are attempting to secure our borders to be sure the financial burden of enforcement should not fall only on state and local governments rather the federal government should provide adequate funding to support local efforts and it has a costsharing relationship with state governments already is in place known as operation stone garden to reimburse them for the borderenforcement efforts in which they engage certainly i appreciate judge boltons concern for preserving individual liberty something our courts must always seek to uphold proper training and federal supervision in statefederal partnerships are essential to both assuring constitutional rights and enforcing our immigration laws our founding fathers concept of federalism does not prohibit such cooperation and we have learned from experience that joint efforts work best asa hutchinson is the

360 of 997 documents the atlanta journalconstitution august 5 2010 thursday main edition should georgia adopt an arizonastyle immigration law byline inger eberhart helen kim ho for the ajc section opinion pg 17a length 1216 words yes enforcement works will save state money badly needed jobs by inger eberhart the basis of the arizona immigration law is the principle of attrition through enforcement the intent section of the law says that this act is to make attrition through enforcement the public policy of all state and local government agencies in arizona attrition through enforcement means that when the immigration laws are enforced illegal aliens selfdeport the passage of arizonas law and the threat of subsequent enforcement led to numerous stories of illegal aliens leaving arizona enforcement works legalization is a losing proposition comprehensive immigration reform is 21stcentury speak for legalization and amnesty when the 1986 amnesty was proposed about 15 million illegal agricultural workers were said to be eligible over 3 million illegal aliens were eventually granted amnesty as a result of fraud and misrepresentations by 1997 there were 5 million illegal aliens today we have 12 million to 20 million in the united states amnesty merely encourages more illegal immigration and does not solve the problem former congresswoman barbara jordan the clintonappointed chairperson of the commission on immigration reform stated it is both a right and a responsibility of a democratic society to manage immigration so that it serves the national interests amnesty did not serve our national interests in 1986 and it does not serve it today arizonas illegal alien population is 460000 according to a 2008 study by the federation for american immigration reform georgias illegal alien population is 490000 their presence costs georgia over 16 billion per year for education health care and incarceration of illegal aliens according to fair georgia taxpayers cannot and will not continue to underwrite illegal aliens since 2006 we have had the georgia security and immigration compliance act which has served as a blueprint for many other states the gsica seeks to remove incentives for illegal immigration such as the illegal acquisition and granting of public benefits and illegal employment enforcement of gsica is crucial while national unemployment trends toward 10 percent georgias unemployment is closer to 103 percent not enforcing our immigration laws is unconscionable with sb 1070 which extends local enforcement of federal immigration laws arizona has drawn a line in the sand it is time for georgia to do the same through the 287g program president bill clinton signed into law federal and local law enforcement agencies partner in order to enforce immigration laws under georgia law and 287g we have checked the nationality and immigration status of those jailed for dui felonies and aggravated misdemeanors since 2009 if the person is in the united states illegally jailers are required to report to the department of homeland security the 287g program is a federal tool that has proven so effective that groups like the georgia association of latino elected officials and the american civil liberties union want it eliminated georgia should now extend local immigration enforcement by adopting arizonas law many democratic and republican candidates for public office have already committed to bringing that legislation to georgia georgians like the vast majority of americans are ready for elected officials to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders inger eberhart is on the board of advisors of the dustin inman society in marietta which advocates strict border enforcement no patchwork state laws will burden police use race to harass citizens by helen kim ho the asian american legal advocacy center of georgia wants an end to illegal immigration aalac believes the only effective way to solve the problem is through passage of comprehensive federal immigration reform and not through piecemeal state legislation but as an organization that principally focuses on our local community weve sought to understand this issue from the perspective of how it would impact regular hardworking asianamericans and others state immigration laws like sb 1070 necessitate unconstitutional racial profiling hurting legal as well as illegal immigrants and common sense tells us that when police are trying to develop a reasonable suspicion that someone they see walking down the street or driving down the road is illegal the persons skin color will be one of the first things they see while the color of a persons skin is evident a persons citizenship status is not imagine being arrested one day because you forgot to carry your naturalization papers proving your citizenship status and the anger you would feel being treated as a secondclass citizen my parents came to the united states because they believed america is a country of equal opportunity for those willing to work hard and play by the rules that ideal is actually part of our constitution the 14th amendment requires states to provide equal protection under the law for all people within its jurisdiction a law that authorizes detention of a certain group of people based on race or color goes against the language of our constitution and the spirit of equal access that brought many of us here state immigration laws will create a confusing patchwork of enforcement policies burdening and exposing local police officers to unfair lawsuits aalac believes that requiring our police to act as immigration officials a responsibility that is and should be on the federal government will create tremendous confusion and cost in implementation among different police agencies already in arizona police are dealing with a mishmash of different training materials policing guidelines and rules based on each agencys interpretation of sb 1070 in one county a police officer is trained to let a driver go with a citation if the officer cannot confirm the drivers legal status while a police officer in another county is trained to send that same driver to border patrol and while one officer may decide to detain an individual for speaking english poorly another officer might decide limited english proficiency is not a reasonable factor in suspecting a persons legal status and under sb 1070 the decisions of our police could later be the subject of a citizens lawsuit challenging an individual officer for failing to follow procedure to the fullest extent of the law patchwork enforcement policies will lead to unfair exposure for police and could potentially jeopardize the trust and collaboration between the community and the police its not just a latino issue before asianamericans or others feel this is just a latino issue lets not forget that discriminatory immigration laws targeting asians existed for more than 80 years in the united states starting with the chinese exclusion act of 1882 and lets also not forget that in the current day and in our state we hear of asianamericans being discriminated against and targeted based on their ethnicity or lack of english language proficiency we cant afford to repeat history and must come together to promote a reasoned compassionate and

367 of 997 documents journal record legislative report oklahoma city ok july 7 2010 wednesday justice dept sues arizona over immigration law byline m scott carter length 887 words washington saying the constitution and federal law do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies the department of justice on tuesday sued the state of arizona over its new immigration law in a brief filed in the federal district court of arizona justice department officials said arizonas new immigration law senate bill 1017 unconstitutionally interferes with the federal governments authority to set and enforce immigration policy a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement the governments brief said having enacted its own immigration policy that conflicts with federal immigration law arizona crossed a constitutional line us attorney general eric holder said the law would place significant burdens on federal agencies diverting their resources away from highpriority targets such as aliens implicated in terrorism drug smuggling and gang activity and those with criminal records   arizonans are understandably frustrated with illegal immigration and the federal government has a responsibility to comprehensively address those concerns holder said but diverting federal resources away from dangerous aliens such as terrorism suspects and aliens with criminal records will impact the entire countrys safety setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration laws is a national responsibility  seeking to address the issue through a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves court documents show the justice department has also requested a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the law arguing that the laws operation will cause irreparable harm arizona impermissibly seeks to regulate immigration by creating an arizonaspecific immigration policy that is expressly designed to rival or supplant that of the federal government the brief noted  as such arizonas immigration policy exceeds a states role with respect to aliens interferes with the federal governments balanced administration of the immigration laws and critically undermines us foreign policy objectives senate bill 1070 does not simply seek to provide legitimate support to the federal governments immigration policy but instead creates an unprecedented independent immigration scheme that exceeds constitutional boundaries legal experts said the lawsuit was a significant moment in immigrant and civil rights history while i agree with the majority of americans that we must have sensible and comprehensive immigration reform that addresses both border security and relief for the undocumented the arizona law is the manifestation of fears fueled by hate groups and failures of the immigration system said doug stump an oklahoma city immigration attorney stump said the lawsuit was necessary to protect constitutional principles the law sanctions racial ethnic and immigrant profiling and needs to be challenged by a greater authority and only the federal government can do that he said although it may be unpopular to some the lawsuit had to be filed to protect the fundamental principles of our constitution the lawsuit he said also could spawn additional challenges to oklahomas immigration law were seeing a pattern across the state where law enforcement agencies are being more aggressive in verifying the immigration status of individuals taken into custody than is allowed by state law stump said routinely especially in rural communities were seeing individuals stopped taken into custody and having their status challenged over traffic violations other experts disagree michelle campney an oklahoma city attorney associated with the phillips murrah law firm said the provisions of oklahomas immigration law that havent been already set aside by federal courts would probably not be subject to federal action as it is now its pretty much consistent with federal law she said but if there was one provision that might be challenged its the provision that you have to provide property documentation to receive state assistance if there was any part of the oklahoma law thats subject to being questioned that would be it federal officials said the arizona laws mandates on law enforcement will result in the harassment and detention of foreign visitors and legal immigrants as well as us citizens who cannot readily prove their lawful status in declarations filed with the lawsuit arizona law enforcement officials including the chiefs of police of phoenix and tucson said the law would hamper their ability to effectively police their communities   both men said victims of or witnesses to crimes would be less likely to contact or cooperate with law enforcement officials and that implementation of the law would require them to reassign officers from critical areas such as violent crimes property crimes and home invasions holder said the suit was filed after extensive consultation with arizona officials law enforcement officers and groups and civil rights advocates the suit was filed on behalf of the department of justice the department of homeland security and the department of state which share responsibilities in administering federal immigration

378 of 997 documents inland valley daily bulletin ontario ca may 28 2010 friday california immigration policy comparable to new arizona law byline sandra emerson staff writer section news length 1642 words the passage of arizonas immigration law has brought californias immigration policy into the debate similar wording in the laws have caused some experts to question the call to boycott arizona from california cities and individuals although they agree that the laws have some similarities there tends to be disagreement on the differences in the laws everybody is trying to say that we have a law just like arizonas law and it really isnt it has similarities but the differences are pretty extraordinary said tim donnelly a republican candidate in the 59th district assembly race and founder of the minuteman civil defense corps of california donnellys biggest quarrel with the comparison of the laws is that californias policy allows police to inquire about a persons legal status and call us immigration and customs enforcement arizonas law allows police to arrest and detain a person suspected of violating a crime and who is suspected of being in the country illegally however californias policy is not enforced due to political reasons donnelly said the ice agent might want to come down there and pick up and deport those suspected to be illegally in the country but theyre not allowed by their superiors he said so thats really where the problem is its not with the agents in the field unlike california policy arizonas law addresses sanctuary cities and allows citizens to sue the government for not enforcing immigration laws the wording of arizonas law is much stronger than californias which has led jose calderon and other latino activists to lobby against the arizona law calderon a professor of sociology and chicano studies at pitzer college in claremont said the way the laws are written there is a difference between police cooperation in checking for immigration status i think thats why there is such a clamor about it calderon said it allows police officers to question anyone they suspect of being an undocumented immigrant and makes it a state crime to be in the state illegally lori haley a public affairs officer for us immigration and customs enforcement said ice works with local law enforcement through various initiatives but agencies tend to have their own policies agencies have their own policies and we represent that haley said we have our job to do and we do it and try to work as best we can with what the local police do the ice section 287g program authorizes the secretary of the us department of homeland security to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to allow designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions the san bernardino county sheriffs department has implemented the program in its jails to identify criminal illegal aliens said cindy beavers sheriffs spokesperson theres a whole series of questions that are asked to every single person who is booked into our facilities and during that time their legal status in the us may come into question beavers said at that point his paperwork is flagged and forwarded to an official with us immigration and customs enforcement who would interview the inmate to determine whether or not he should be taken before an immigration judge beavers said the departments implementation of 287g is the extent of their immigration enforcement beavers said if we stop somebody whether its a traffic stop or for some criminal activity we dont question what their immigration status is beavers said were not immigration officers and sheriff hoops made that clear to all of his deputies since january 2006 the program has identified more than 70000 individuals mostly in jails who are suspected of being in the country illegally according to ice there are 71 active agreements to use the program and more than 1120 officers have been trained and certified the los angeles county sheriffs department does not check for immigration status while on patrol but it does assist the us immigration and customs enforcement ice by interviewing inmates to be released from county jails sheriffs spokesman steve whitmore said if theyre going to be released from the county jail we interview foreignborn inmates and give that information to ice its random and its not an exact science whitmore said however he said that all gang members are interviewed to determine their immigration status before they are released the los angeles county sheriffs department has also implemented the 287g program in its jails congressman gary miller rbrea said the boycott of arizona being pursued by the city of los angeles is hypocrtical they come back to washington dc every year wanting 100 million a year to incarcerate illegal immigrants he said they want to go make this statement but then want the federal government to pick up the cost of incarcerating the illegals in jails you cant have it both ways you want to be a sanctuary city but want the federal government to pick up the cost calderon said the expansion of 287g in riverside and san bernardino counties is giving law enforcement more authority to do work that should be left to the federal government there have been many instances where theyve lead to arbitrary arrests for minor offenses where due process rights are violated calderon said not only will the federal government have the ability to enforce immigration laws in arizona but local and state authorities will be able to he said nowhere in the arizona law does it define what is the criteria that you would use in terms of having reasonable suspicion to stop people just to stop and question them on their immigration status calderon said that is really far different than what is written in the california policy and really opens it up for state and local police just to stop anyone on the suspicion of how theyre dressed language or surname sandraemersoninlandnewspaperscom 9094838555 comparing policies experts have said californias immigration policy is similar to arizonas new immigration law the

379 of 997 documents st petersburg times florida may 27 2010 thursday politifactcom edition bill mccollum sends mixed signals on arizonas immigration law byline aaron sharockman section politifact florida length 1184 words bill mccollum on the arizona immigration law bill mccollum on sunday may 16th 2010 in interviews with florida media the ruling fullflop arizonas controversial immigration law has proven problematic for florida republicans who in large part appear wary of fully endorsing a proposal thats supported by a majority of floridians but one that also could cost votes among floridas hispanic population the tightropewalking act is perhaps no more apparent than when it comes to attorney general bill mccollum a republican running for governor mccollums primary opponent rick scott unabashedly supports the law which will require local law enforcement officials once police stop a person to verify the immigration status of those they reasonably suspect of being in the country illegally the law is also supported by a 58 percent of floridians according to a may 2010 st petersburg timesmiami heraldbay news 9central florida news 13 poll we decided to rate mccollums statements on the arizona law using our flipometer which measures how consistent someone has been when taking a position on an issue before we get to that though we need to give you a quick history of how the arizona law came to pass the bill in question originally was signed into law on april 23 2010 by arizona gov jan brewer an amended version of the bill one to lessen the prospects that racial profiling could occur passed and was signed into law on april 30 the new version of the law says a law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county city town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the united states or arizona constitution the prior version had said that an official may not solely consider race in such circumstances the change in the bill though its impact can be debated is important to note when discussing mccollums position since his first comments refer to the first version of the bill while later comments refer to the second version mccollums first published comments about the arizona law came on april 27 after the original bill had passed he was asked whether he would like a florida version of arizonas law i think arizona has its own unique problems mccollum said i dont think florida should enact laws like this quite that far out then in stories on may 13 and may 14 after the amended version of arizonas law passed mccollum aboutfaced and said he would support a florida version as state and local law enforcement officials in arizona begin to implement the states aggressive new border security law to crackdown on illegal immigration i applaud gov brewer and the arizona legislature for stepping up their enforcement efforts at a time when president obamas administration has let states down mccollum said i support arizonas law as amended and if the federal government fails to secure our borders and solve the problem of illegal immigration i would support a similar law for florida and he also said arizona leaders recently made needed changes that address concerns i had that the law could be abused and misused to perform racially profiled stops and arrests i do not support any measure that would result in racial profiling or other unintended consequences for lawabiding american citizens then on may 16 came another comment to a television reporter in port st lucie this time mccollum said he didnt think an arizonastyle immigration law was needed in florida i didnt change my position but arizona changed its law after they passed a law that was very bad and that had that the potential for racial profiling mccollum said he was then asked if it was realistic that a similar law might be passed in florida we dont need that law in florida he said thats not whats going to happen here mccollums most recent comments were picked up on by the scott campaign which highlighted the quote in a television ad mccollum called the original version of the arizona immigration law far out but then said he would support the amended law being adopted in florida since theres a debate over how much difference the amendment ultimately will have in how the law is enforced its hard for us to properly measure whether mccollums position shift in this instance is a complete flipflop but what does strike us are mccollums comments on may 13 and may 16 both in reference to the amended version on may 13 mccollum said he would support implementing the arizona law in florida then on may 16 he said florida doesnt need that law which is it mccollum spokeswoman kristy campbell said mccollums position since the final version of the law passed has been consistent she says mccollum supports the law arizona passed in large part because of failures at the federal level however mccollum thinks an arizonastyle law is not currently needed in florida because of the states unique issues dealing with immigration but mccollums statements to the media on may 13 and may 16 are just too different to us and warrant a rating of fullflop about this statement published thursday may 27th 2010 at 1257 pm

380 of 997 documents deseret morning news salt lake city may 26 2010 wednesday rightwing schism stalls immigration reform length 848 words washington the immigration debate that will have lasting consequences is not the one between the left and the right but the one taking place within the ranks of conservatives in the united states and around the world a few days ago during a visit to a school in silver spring md michelle obama was confronted by a 7yearold girl who asked her why the president is taking everybody away that doesnt have papers with mexican first lady margarita zavala next to her obama responded thats something we have to work on right the girl produced a devastating rejoinder but my mom doesnt have any papers the antiimmigration right led by radio personality rush limbaugh accused the white house of staging the exchange claiming the girl had botched the delivery because she was supposed to say arizona rather than obama limbaugh was implying that it was a stunt to obtain sympathy against that states recent antiimmigration law the proimmigration camp in the republican party meanwhile sidestepped questions about the incident avoiding confrontation with the nativists but maintaining enough distance to signal a more moderate position this anecdote illustrates the tension within the right at large sen john mccain who proposed giving millions of undocumented foreigners a path to legalization during the george w bush administration is scared of losing a primary against an antiimmigration candidate in arizona where the recent law is popular among conservatives mccains lukewarm support for a law he intimately dislikes is very telling about the relative strength of the anti immigration forces within the party the chasm within the right goes back a century the restrictive laws of the 1920s a watershed in immigration history saw a split between nativist republicans and southern democrats on the one hand and the business community which wanted immigrant labor on the other the intellectual right including walter lippmann was largely proimmigration when president ronald reagan a proimmigration conservative gave amnesty to 3 million immigrants in 1986 he had to include in the law sanctions against employers this reflected the pressure from the antiimmigration right in the 1990s proposition 187 a california ballot initiative that would have denied public services to undocumented immigrants became a flashpoint of the conservativeagainstconservative fight its most prominent backer was republican gov pete wilson but several gop heavyweights opposed it jack kemp and william bennett put out a statement saying the vast majority of immigrants hold principles which the republican party warmly embraces an entrepreneurial spirit and selfreliance hostility to government intervention strong family values and deeplyrooted religious faith in recent years the debate pitted bush mccain and other proimmigrant republicans against the likes of rep tom tancredo of colorado today the debate rages on among conservatives the wall street journal is a staunch supporter of immigration while sean hannity a fox news talk show host is a ferocious critic this is not just an american debate in spain conservatives are equally divided the regional government of madrid headed by popular party notable esperanza aguirre with help from her immigration secretary javier fernandezlasquetty and adviser mauricio rojas a former swedish parliamentarian of chilean origin has tried to push the party toward embracing immigration there is strong resistance from those who vilify the decision by the spanish government to legalize 700000 immigrants in 2005 in britains conservative party a gulf separates proimmigration figures such as former chancellor of the exchequer kenneth clarke and oxford university chancellor and former hong kong gov chris patten from antiimmigrant spokesmen such as former diplomat andrew green chairman of migrationwatchuk i am not implying there is no debate among the left the division among liberals in the united states is old too the unions opposed immigration for decades they were instrumental in ending the bracero program in the 1960s as was liberal tv journalist edward murrow who devoted a sensational report harvest of shame to denigrating the workpermit program many on the left furthermore support immigration for reasons related to collectivist multiculturalism rather than to the free movement of people but today if the division were less profound on the right immigration reform would pass it is the type of issue that requires a broad consensus yet the paramount factor today is that a faction of the right has forcefully held its ground against anything that smacks of legalizing the people who live in the shadows and creating an avenue for significant future inflows until the debate among conservatives is settled no meaningful reform is possible alvaro

381 of 997 documents deseret morning news salt lake city may 23 2010 sunday as immigration reform fades from obamas agenda emanuels role under scrutiny byline peter nicholas tribune washington bureau length 905 words washington prospects for an immigration overhaul are fizzling this year and some democratic lawmakers are focusing blame on the pugnacious democratic operative who works just down the hall from president barack obama rahm emanuel white house chief of staff and longtime party strategist has argued privately that its a bad time for democrats to push an immigration bill a potential land mine in the midst of a crucial midterm election emanuels stance coupled with his longheld wariness about the politics of immigration is emboldening key democrats to come forward and ask that he step aside from the issue theres always a sense that no matter how hard we work to get through the white house we have to get through rahm said us rep raul grijalva dariz i would like immigration not to be part of the chief of staffs portfolio it would make our ability to convince and access decisionmakers in the white house a lot easier emanuel has a complicated history with the immigration question dating back to the 1990s as a top aide to former president bill clinton he stressed the message that clinton was hardnosed about policing illegal immigration later as a chicago congressman who took on the assignment of installing more democrats in the house emanuel cautioned that immigration was the third rail of american politics dangerous to those who touch it now as obamas top aide emanuel has argued much the same thing in private meetings he has warned that pressing ahead with an immigration bill could jeopardize the chances of moderate and conservative democratic candidates in the runup to the midterms according to people familiar with the matter a practiced nosecounter emanuel has also questioned whether there are enough republican votes to help pass a bill that among other things would provide a path to legal status for the 11 million immigrants living here illegally democratic lawmakers and advocates who have clashed with emanuel over the years fear that immigration is destined to be a secondtier priority so long as he is in his current role its going to be much easier for this issue to move after rahm emanuel leaves the white house said simon rosenberg president of the new democratic network a think tank rahm has a long history of a lack of sympathy for the importance of the immigration issue a white house spokesman did not respond to requests for comment with time running out the chances of an immigration overhaul this year are receding no bill has yet been introduced in the senate come june the chamber will be enmeshed in the confirmation of supreme court nominee elena kagan certainly obama has shown he is in no rush at a mexican heritage event earlier this month obama said he merely wanted to begin work on the issue this year not complete a bill in that time frame yet as a candidate in 2008 obama promised to address immigration in his first year in office emanuel is part of a cluster of democratic political operatives and pollsters who have seen immigration as treacherous terrain us sen robert menendez dnj said that when emanuel chaired the democratic congressional campaign committee in the 2006 election cycle he believed the question of immigration is a political liability to a series of members and i dont know anything that has changed his mind on that in washington emanuel once lived in the basement of the house of stan greenberg a former clinton pollster greenberg and others wrote a memo in 2007 warning that many democratic voters take a hardline position on immigration which they called a real wedge issue around the same time emanuel described immigration as a political third rail proponents of reform said rahm emanuel threw immigrants under the bus advocate frank sharry said at the time by that point a bitter rift had developed between emanuel then a house member and some members of the congressional hispanic caucus or chc in 2005 some in the caucus withheld their democratic dues out of frustration with party leaders including emanuel they objected that dues money was going to vulnerable democrats who for reelection purposes were taking a strict stance on illegal immigration rep joe baca dcalif said in an interview every member of the chc was very concerned with rahm emanuel i know rahm had a duty to protect the marginal members but that was also going against some of our principles in what we stood for in trying to deal with comprehensive immigration immigration was part of emanuels portfolio when he worked for bill clinton in the 1990s part of emanuels job was making sure that clintons enforcement efforts were publicized the idea was to portray clinton as a different kind of democrat who made lawandorder a focus doris meissner a former head of the immigration and

proposal that would give police the power the check immigration status an immigration lawyer said its overly simple byline jeff frantz york daily record pa section state and regional news length 909 words may 5a state representative proposed legislation tuesday backed by several local lawmakers that was inspired by a controversial law passed last week in arizona to combat illegal immigration if passed the bill by rep daryl metcalfe rbutler would charge local law enforcement with checking immigration status investigating businesses suspected of knowingly employing illegal immigrants and requiring businesses to verify a potential employees legal status the proposal came a day after state sen daylin leach dmontgomery introduced a bill in direct opposition to arizonas law rep scott perry rcarroll township supports metcalfes effort and said he will likely join as bill cosponsor the federal government has failed to enforce the nations immigration laws perry said which is now forcing states to act because illegal immigration fosters crime lowers wages and puts an added burden on taxpayers what do we gain having cheaper tomatoes in the short term to sell out our security and sovereignty in the long term perry said both perry and metcalfe said the proposal doesnt target any one ethnic or immigrant group jose colon president of the board for the centro hispano jose hernandez said much of yorks hispanic community agrees too many illegal immigrants abuse the system he said he supports people stopped for violating the law having to prove who they are saying it only makes sense in an age of terror but colon said the necessary immigration laws already exist and the federal government needs to better enforce them the federal government is more equipped to properly deal with the issue than states or municipalities he said colon was also bothered by the rhetoric metcalfe used introducing his proposal when he spoke of murders and rapists the vast majority of people here illegally came to work colon said and it makes it harder to have the serious necessary discussion of the issue with such inflamed rhetoric and he added such talk could create friction between the hispanic community and others craig trebilcock a local immigration attorney said the federal government has failed to create a working immigration policy but metcalfes policy is still ridiculous trebilcock said the people pressing these laws dont understand how complex it is to determine the immigration status of someone there are 42 types of visas trebilcock said and thats before counting those granted asylum and others local law enforcement no matter how well meaning are not trained or equipped to become primary immigration enforcement officers trebilcock said youll end up with a bunch of lawsuits trebilcock said a bunch of municipalities getting sued because of the thousands of people getting stopped theres going to be a couple problems instead he said the law will discourage legal immigrants doctors scientists laborers students that the country needs from every coming here about the bill if passed house bill 2479 would require an employer to verify a prospective employees immigration status lying about immigration status would be a seconddegree misdemeanor require a law enforcement officer to verify a persons immigration status if the officer reasonably suspects that a person legally stopped detained or arrested is in the country illegally an officer could not inquire about peoples immigration status if they were not first stopped for another offense require county district attorneys to investigate companies suspected of employing illegal immigrants companies caught knowingly doing so could lose access to state grants and their licenses to operate create a thirddegree felony for intentionally smuggling illegal aliens into pennsylvania police would be able to impound smugglers vehicles according to the office of the bills

click here to read the full proposal political outlook in 2007 state reps daryl metcalfe and scott perry were part of a group that introduced a series of bills that would have changed some of pennsylvanias immigration laws those never made it out of committee metcalfe said tuesday his proposal has bipartisan support but is not likely to receive much support from house democratic leadership or gov ed rendell however he said with a budget fight looming and representatives up for election in november there could be an opportunity to muster the political will necessary for passage but metcalfes bill isnt the only piece of immigration legislation now in harrisburg state sen daylin leach dmontgomery introduced a proposal that would reinforce current laws and in the event of future changes to federal law stop local law enforcement to serve as immigration officers it is very important that we make it clear that pennsylvania does not support racial profiling leach said to see more

387 of 997 documents the christian science monitor may 4 2010 tuesday after healthcare reform is immigration reform achievable many say arizonas stringent new law demands immigration reform from washington but congress may not be ready for another political showdown so soon after healthcare reform byline linda feldmann staff writer length 1197 words immigration reform is a steep climb under the best of circumstances the last president to sign a major overhaul was ronald reagan in 1986 and now with washington as deeply polarized as it is and in the thick of a midterm election campaign getting anywhere becomes wellnigh impossible that still has not stopped senate majority leader harry reid d of nevada from trying to keep alive efforts to bring an immigration overhaul to a vote this year senate democrats unveiled a new proposal for reform late last week stressing security first then a pathway to legalization for the estimated 108 million people in the country illegally the democrats were making a longshot effort to attract republican support but none was forthcoming and the issue has receded in washington as the gulf of mexico oil slick and the failed times square car bomb attack consume attention but for senator reid immigration remains a top political concern he is embroiled in a tough reelection battle and he needs the support of nevadas large hispanic population 20 percent of the state arizonas tough new antiillegal immigration law which requires police officers to check a persons immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is in the united states illegally has added urgency to the calls for federal reform critics including president obama fear the law could lead to racial profiling but the president sounds doubtful that a comprehensive reform that addresses both border security and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants can be finished this year weve gone through a very tough year and ive been working congress pretty hard mr obama told reporters on air force one april 28 so i know there may not be an appetite immediately to dive into another controversial issue why has fixing an immigration system widely seen as broken been so hard to achieve in some ways analysts say its like healthcare reform there are many elements and constituencies with welldrawn battle lines after the immigration reform and control act of 1986 failed to deliver on its promise a loss of trust ensued making subsequent reform even more difficult to pursue and as with health reform it will take major presidential and congressional muscle to achieve success immigration brings up very intense emotions for people even conflicting emotions says frank sharry executive director of americas voice an immigration advocacy group people who are close to the immigrant experience feel a sense of outrage that most americans dont understand that most immigrants are really good people who work really hard and really want to be american mr sharry adds on the other side there are people who feel really strongly and outraged they feel the country its sovereignty and its culture are threatened by immigration in general and in particular illegal immigration then theres the vast ambivalent middle and an immigration policy that is not well understood the 1986 reform outlawed the hiring of illegal immigrants and required employers to check job applicants for proof of legal status but fake identification was easy to obtain and the hiring of illegal immigrants continued apace poorly guarded borders and lax enforcement of immigration laws have made it easy for illegal immigrants many of whom arrive with visas which they then overstay to work their way into american life with impunity the 1986 amnesty for some has only encouraged more to come and the system for legal immigration was not reformed complicating matters for advocates of a crackdown on illegal immigration is the opposition they face from powerful interests like the us chamber of commerce and labor unions which believe immigration reform will make for a more orderly employment system and thus be a boon to the us economy opponents of comprehensive reform particularly the path to citizenship see other motivations at work this is an issue with strange dynamics says dan stein president of the federation for american immigration reform you have wellmoneyed special interests either on the side of the status quo or largescale immigration some business groups like hiring illegal labor because its docile and exploitable more recently mr stein adds the democratic party has become more enchanted with immigrations potential to build an electoral base the institutional interests of the two parties have hardened in a way that neutralizes positive public discourse in the runup to the 2010 midterms the importance of the latino vote is evident in a february report americas voice identifies 40 battleground house and senate races where latino voters will be key although immigration is not the no 1 issue for most latinos it is clearly a defining issue the report says like all americans the economic crisis continues to be the biggest concern for latino voters the report continues however their closeness to the immigrant experience makes immigration reform a threshold issue for many so its not just reid who is looking to his latino constituents to save his seat but on the flip side there are members for whom the immigration issue could be toxic particularly so for conservative democrats in districts without large immigrant populations they want nothing to do with immigration reform this year and not all republicans are enamored of the new arizona law former florida gov jeb bush has raised objections as has the states republican candidate for the senate marco rubio the son of cuban immigrants the arizona law goes into effect 90 days from its april 23 signing unless a court challenge succeeds in blocking implementation the most likely outcome for immigration reform is that the senate holds off at least until next year allowing the electoral considerations to recede in prominence but one need look no further than the major push for immigration reform in 2007 to wonder if an overhaul will ever be doable then a republican president george w bush led the charge and got 12 republican senators to join him but the measure still failed to reach the floor for a vote in this latest effort at reform the only republican willing to work with the democrats was sen lindsey graham r of south carolina now hes off that track incensed that reid had pushed to move immigration reform before energy legislation and some analysts say to protect his friend john mccain the arizona senator who at one time was a major proponent of comprehensive reform but has backed away given his primary challenge from the right what you have is great disappointment that immigration didnt move in 2007 despite bipartisan support a republican president pushing it and things getting a lot worse out there with laws like in arizona says democratic communications strategist peter fenn there is impetus to move solid good federal legislation especially when states are going to blame the federal government for not acting but the key is to craft a bill that can actually pass ·eloise quintanilla contributed to this report

jazmine ulloa the brownsville herald texas section state and regional news length 832 words may 2hundreds of thousands took to the streets nationwide saturday in protest of arizonas new immigration law during international workers day the contentious legislation which was signed by gov jan brewer more than a week ago has been referred to as draconian by immigration advocates as they said it would mandate racial profiling by requiring officers to request legal documentation of people they suspect to be in the country illegally its stringent provisions have sparked massive criticism and incited new momentum for comprehensive immigration reform an energy immigration activists say is reminiscent of the historic proreform demonstrations of 2006 but in spite of renewed mobilization efforts immigration and border issues experts do not see such changes to the immigration system coming any time soon federal and state leaders are casting the national discourse on immigration reform in terms of border security political observers said it is a framing some feel could have been aimed at improving the chances of congress tackling the issue this session even as president barack obama has knocked it off his agenda but an approach which immigration advocates urge that will not garner a more humane comprehensive look at the legislation last week though obama signaled a lack of appetite to address immigration senate democrats revealed a framework for reform that would boost security along the countrys borders before providing a path to residency for undocumented immigrants in the country according to national news reports the plans were the latest in a conversation about reform that have entangled the issue with national security immigration and border experts said but the connection of the two issues is the very reason why i do not think we are going to have comprehensive immigration reform this year said tony knopp history professor emeritus at the university of texas at brownsville and texas southmost college the violence on the other side of the border has people very concerned and not very open to an immigration reform package at this time but if you successfully frame any policy as part of national security there will be a greater chance of passing it said john skrentny a sociology professor and director of the center for comparative immigration studies at the university of california at san diego such was the case in the late 1950s with the passing of the national defense education act skrentny said for years people believed the school funding was a local issue and that the federal government should not get involved even though campuses were struggling the professor said that changed when the soviet union launched its first satellite ahead of the united states spurring the country to finally pass the act once you put the word defense in there the politics of it just changed he said who is going to go against national security its good politics similarly border issues experts said arizona framed its immigration bill in terms of border security lawmakers in favor of the bill said the state took such tough measures because people were frustrated with illegal immigration and the flow of drugs from mexico into the united states those concerns were merited knopp said as drug cartel violence in mexico has escalated and there is a concrete fear of spillover violence but there were also other underlying factors why the bill was pushed particularly the bad shape of the states economy and the fear of cultural change from such a high influx of people he said arizona is one of the states that has had the largest mortgage defaults knopp said property values dropped greatly especially in phoenix still if political leaders do not separate national and border security from comprehensive immigration reform we are doomed to make some costly policy mistakes said tony zavaleta vice president of external affairs at utbtsc case in point the border wall he said the billions of dollars that we spent on the border wall could have been invested in jobs education and healthcare besides concrete and steel in washington dc congressman solomon ortiz has been working to push immigration reform since december to him the issue is about creating a mix of tougher enforcement but also humane policies that do not break families apart or leave educated undocumented students without a place to go after graduation he said i am not saying we should open our borders but lets pass comprehensive immigration reform he said

392 of 997 documents roll call april 28 2010 wednesday on immigration businesses band with rivals byline bennett roth section lobbying length 1255 words business groups which have clashed with democrats over everything from health care to wall street reform have been working quietly with congressional leaders and another one of their typical opponents unions to seek an immigration overhaul for months organizations such as the us chamber of commerce the national restaurant association and the national association of home builders have been engaged in regular meetings with labor unions and key senate staffers to figure out how to revamp the nations visa system to ensure a future flow of legal immigrants who are able to work in this country such a provision would be a key part of a comprehensive immigration package outlined by sens charles schumer dny and lindsey graham rsc their asyetunveiled bill would deal with the politically charged issue of illegal immigration no one has more of a stake in fixing the system than businesses said tamar jacoby president of immigrationworks usa which is composed of state employers and trade associations but jacoby who has participated in the talks on immigration with schumer and graham staffers also said there is wariness in the business community about how sincere the administration is in promoting immigration this year some worry that the recent push is mostly posturing so the democrats can energize hispanic voters for the midterm elections they also fear that lack of bipartisan participation will jeopardize the latest initiative there is concern this is not a serious effort jacoby said but if it is serious we will be there participating the issue has rocketed to the top of the national agenda in recent days with the approval of tough measures by arizonas gopdominated legislature that give law enforcement officials in the state expanded powers to stop and arrest illegal immigrants the new law which was signed by arizona gov jan brewer r last week triggered sharp criticism from hispanic groups and president barack obama who called the measure misguided and urged congress to address comprehensive immigration reform however the pledge by obama and senate majority leader harry reid dnev to tackle the complex issue elicited a stinging rebuke from graham the south carolina republican accused reid of engaging in a phony political effort on immigration that would threaten the success of a climate change measure that graham was also working on with democratic senators prospects for the immigration measure appeared to dim tuesday as reid said he would take up climate change legislation first and graham said there was no hope of passing broad immigration changes this year nahb president and ceo jerry howard said that while his group had been very engaged in the talks he feared that if graham isnt in the room for the negotiations on the bill the prospects for it going anywhere are significantly diminished howard said there must be republicans or conservative businessoriented democrats involved as of tuesday afternoon it was unclear whether the group would meet this week to discuss the immigration issue participants said with all the political fireworks business groups said they want to make sure the talks on immigration lead to legislation that has a realistic chance of passage we want a bill that is good policy that will become enacted said randy johnson us chamber of commerce senior vice president for labor immigration and employee benefits on its website the chamber lists immigration as one of its priorities for the 111th congress and says the organization will continue to push for comprehensive immigration reform that increases security the chamber also supports the creation of a carefully monitored guest or essential worker program to fill the growing gaps in americans workforce the chamber backed immigration reform the last time the issue came up in 2007 when president george w bush endorsed congressional efforts to approve a comprehensive bill however that bill cosponsored by sen john mccain rariz died in part because of strong opposition from conservative republicans who were suspicious of efforts to create a temporaryworker program for undocumented immigrants and establish a path to citizenship the failure of the measure highlighted the rift in the republican party between its business wing concerned with filling jobs and more populist elements within the party that fear illegal immigrants are overrunning their communities antiimmigration groups argue businesses support some of the immigration reform provisions simply because it helps their bottom lines the goal for big business is the minimal amount of hassle to get cheap labor said julie kirchner executive director of the federation for american immigration reform which is focused on stopping illegal immigration and increasing border security howard at nahb however said his group has a vested interest in immigration laws since immigrants have historically been the backbone of the construction industry from the irish workers of the past century to the current hispanic employees when the economy was booming he said we couldnt get a lot of people to take construction jobs on the other end of the economic spectrum a spokeswoman for the national association of manufacturers said immigration reform is also needed to ensure that the us retains skilled workers in a global economy the manufacturers association has been focusing on increasing visas for the large number of foreignborn college graduates in specialties such as science and technology manufacturers often do not have access to these potential workers because of outdated immigration laws nam spokeswoman erin streeter said streeter added that her group wants to see the green card system simplified and a more efficient way for employers to verify if their employees are legal within the democratic party organized labor has in the past expressed concern that illegal immigrants drive down wages however both the service employees international union and the aflcio have participated in the talks with business on the visa program for future workers there is pretty much a united sense that you got to fix this said sam medina executive vice president of the seiu medina said the common ground between the unions and businesses on immigration were very unique no other issue unites us like this one he said medina said the groups were close to an agreement on the visa issue but one business lobbyist said privately that they were not close enough to the point of drafting legislation but were holding conversations at the 30000foot level as business and union groups work behind the scenes other immigration reform advocates have been working more publicly to drum up support such as the recent large rally promoted by hispanic groups in washington i think there has been a tremendous amount of organizing said clarissa martinez de castro director of immigration and national campaigns for the national council of la raza she said the passage of the arizona law has become a lightning rod and watershed moment for those in the hispanic community seeking immigration reform she said the effort was deeper and broader than in 2007 with more events planned and a phone campaign to members of congress under way at the same time martinez de castro acknowledged that pledges to move ahead with immigration reform may involve some political posturing after all this is

mcclatchy newspapers section business and financial news length 998 words mar 25washington with the overhaul of the nations health care system almost off his todo list president barack obama has renewed his promise to revamp immigration laws this year i pledge to do everything in my power to forge a bipartisan consensus this year on this important issue obama said in a video message to tens of thousands of activists who were calling for revising immigration laws as they gathered last sunday on washingtons national mall chances are slim to none that the president will fulfill that pledge this year however as administration officials and lawmakers in congress have put several other priorities from tightening financial regulations to creating jobs ahead of overhauling immigration laws furthermore lawmakers and proimmigration advocates question whether obama has the political capital and congress the will to deal with another potentially divisive hotbutton issue after the bruising battle over health care and with novembers midterm elections on the horizon theres nobody in there ready to say hey lets write an immigration bill nobody said sen lindsey graham rsc who coauthored an immigration framework with sen charles schumer dny that the president recently embraced democrats are riskaverse if you dont believe me go ask them about whether or not they want to take up immigration reform in the senate since obama took office theres been little action on restructuring federal immigration law or figuring out what to do with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants who already are in this country schumer and grahams outline of a bill calls for creating a hightech tamperproof social security card that would ensure that employers hire only legal workers it includes a temporary worker program and penalties for illegal immigrants fines or community service while allowing them to remain in the us rep luis gutierrez dill introduced a bill in december that would provide 100000 visas for immigrants from countries that have high illegal immigration rates and would expedite legal immigration for close relatives of us citizens and legal residents democrats and republicans called gutierrezs measure a nonstarter however theres little evidence that tackling immigration is a burning priority in a recent wall street journal interview white house chief of staff rahm emanuel didnt even mention it when listing obamas posthealth care agenda which includes dealing with financial regulation and job creation retooling the no child left behind education provisions and amending campaignfinance law to rebut a recent us supreme court ruling that permits corporations and unions to finance campaign ads house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif in a statement about sundays immigration rally said we look forward to sending a bipartisan bill to the presidents desk she didnt say when the rev samuel rodriguez the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference said that he and other proimmigration religious leaders met monday with members of pelosis staff in washington and were told that any movement on immigration would have to start in the senate they looked at me straight in the eye and said it must be led by the senate rodriguez said i left the meeting at pelosis office feeling oh boy this will be a long climb im not sure congress is ready for this rodeo senate majority leader harry reid dnev said wednesday that he was still hopeful about getting to immigration this year graham said however that if obama wanted an immigration bill he should write it himself and have the house of representatives take the lead because partyline votes on health care had taken the oxygen out of the room and poisoned the well in the senate on immigration the president ought to put one out there on his own graham said if youre telling the community were going to do this you lead you just cant put any capital in it and say its a big deal right before the election after health care it just doesnt make any sense the rev jim wallis the president of sojourners a liberal christian evangelical network said he came away from meetings with congressional democratic leaders feeling that the desire to do something on immigration was there but the will wasnt is there political support for it in washington no there isnt wallis said were asking them to generate the political will and well respond with public support rodriguez said that obama must employ the same sustained public sales effort and private armtwisting strategy he used to get the health bill passed if he wanted to get an immigration bill through congress the question is if the president has the political capital and the wherewithal to push a bill through rodriguez said if immigration isnt addressed before novembers elections congressional democrats might find themselves voted out of office by the same latino community that gave obama 75 percent of its vote in 2008 largely because of his vow to change immigration laws proimmigration organizations predict that latino ire over a lack of progress on immigration policy could affect as many as 40

valley contingent traveling to washington democrats have a majority in both houses of congress and a president who said he wants to make this happen its the best opportunity weve had in the last 10 years if we squander it its definitely going to be a long wait critics of immigration reform say the march will further galvanize the opposition and they cite a recent rasmussen reports survey showing that twothirds of americans believe illegal immigrants are a major strain on the us budget the american public is aware of the fact that illegal immigration does not provide cheap labor it provides

406 of 997 documents orange county register california march 17 2010 wednesday oc jails to check inmates status byline by cindy carcamo the orange county register section news pg a length 921 words highlight focus for deportation in national program will first be on violent offenders all inmates booked into orange county jails will now have their immigration status checked part of a national effort to identify and deport people who are in the country illegally and suspected or convicted of committing crimes at 6 am tuesday law enforcement officials at jails from santa ana to laguna beach began running inmates fingerprints through department of homeland security databases the program called secure communities determines whether inmates have had any contact with the immigration system it flags immigration officials who can put a hold on those who are believed to be in the country illegally those inmates are detained for 48 hours to give immigration officials a chance to pick them up its a tool that allows us to do our jobs more effectively said david venturella executive director of the secure communities initiative within immigration and customs enforcement its just one piece of an overall comprehensive strategy to help local law enforcement allowing us to better identify alien criminals and remove them from the united states its a monumental improvement in the way we do business orange county joins 119 other counties in the nation already using the system which has sparked criticism and praise from both sides of the immigration debate immigration and customs enforcement officials hope to launch the program in all counties by 2013 the program is provided at no cost to local agencies immigration officers already work at the costa mesa city jail at the county jail deputies already screen inmates immigration status under a partnership with the federal government at both jails inmates who say they are foreignborn receive additional screening to check legal status the new program is more accurate because all inmates not just those who say they are foreignborn will be screened for immigration status venturella said this is more automatic orange county sheriffs cmdr dave wilson said currently people come in off the street and folks interview if they dont selfproclaim residency or legal status outside of the united states we dont have a real way of confirming unless they trip up or something like that while deputies who received immigration crosstraining could tap into federal databases before the programs launch wilson said it didnt work as quickly as it does now and some inmates may have slipped through the cracks the new system still misses people who are in the country illegally but never had contact with the immigration system thats where the crosstrained screeners could step in and ask more questions to determine an inmates true legal status wilson said how it works instead of allowing only state and local law enforcement agencies to check the fbi database for criminal history during a fingerprint scan the program is also linked to federal immigration databases to screen a persons immigration record the fbi and federal immigration check happens simultaneously when there is a fingerprint match the system automatically flags immigration officials in most cases inmates will finish serving their sentences before they are transferred to immigration custody for possible deportation still federal officials said they dont have enough resources to pick up everyone in the system as an illegal immigrant we have a limited amount of resources venturella said our objective would be to identify and remove all criminal aliens from the united states like any governmental agency or business you have a limited amount of dollars coming in he said the agency is focusing on the worst criminal offenders who are in the country illegally this means those who are arrested on suspicion of committing violent crimes such as murder rape and kidnapping immigration officials may get some nonviolent offenders to leave the us voluntarily while others may end up back in the community from october 2009 until the end of february immigration officials arrested or issued detainers against 21556 people nationwide who were identified as being in the country illegally and charged or convicted of crimes of those 4523 were arrested on suspicion of or convicted of violent crimes about 14741 have already been removed from the country some have been identified but not yet removed they are completing their sentences critics on both sides immigration officials said the new screening avoids concerns about racial profiling because everyones fingerprints are checked however the program doesnt stop law enforcement officials from making arrests based on racial profiling said joan friedland immigration policy director for the national immigration law center an immigrant advocacy group in addition she said she was concerned about immigration agents deporting people who dont have serious criminal convictions other critics said they worry immigration officials are too preoccupied with identifying criminals who are in the country illegally and arent placing enough emphasis on deporting them in an efficient manner its not enough to just find people you have to wonder what good it does to identify all these people if they are not going to be removing everyone who should be removed were not getting real bang for our buck yet said jessica vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies venturella acknowledges that for now the program has enough funding to process only the most serious offenders 7147967924 or ccarcamoocregistercom loaddate march 18 2010 language english graphic

activists who voted for president barack obama say he has failed to fulfill a campaign pledge to overhaul immigration laws its way overdue said gil navarro a member of the san bernardino county board of education that was one of the promises the president gave us and we want to hold him accountable like any other public official navarro is creating a latino democratic caucus of the inland empire a group chartered by the county democratic party that will focus on immigration and other issues of concern to latinos navarro is in the process of filing paperwork to make the group official a lot of our relatives that have come to this country illegally are looking to share in the american dream he said even though theyre not here legally they still pay taxes if we dont want more people coming here illegally from other countries we need to fix the problem mel albiso a board member for the colton joint unified school district plans to join the group theres no attention being paid to the topic of immigration no discussion no dialogue albiso said all the time that goes by people and families are suffering its up to us to bring the topic to the forefront and put the political pressure where it needs to be placed there is some debate about how closely the views of latino activist groups and democratic lawmakers reflect the opinions of typical latino voters last week the center for immigration studies a nonpartisan think tank that supports reduced immigration levels released a zogby survey of about 1500 latino black and asianamerican likely voters most members of the three groups want the law enforced and illegal immigrants to return to their home countries overall they also feel that the current level of immigration is too high the survey found the leadership of the hispanic community is overwhelmingly in favor of an amnesty and increased legal immigration said steven camarota the centers director of research when you survey hispanic voters you get a more complicated picture in general theyre much more proenforcement than is the leadership of organizations that claim to speak for hispanics obama received about twothirds of the nearly 10 million votes cast by latinos in the november 2008 election during the campaign he said he would act on immigration reform in his first year in office but immigration has been pushed to the sidelines as obama has struggled to turn around the economy and overhaul the health care system some latino democrats are willing to give obama the benefit of the doubt for now we have to give him time said lynda gonzalez a 48yearold mexicanamerican who lives in bloomington there are multiple problems out there people are losing their jobs and their homes to me thats more important rep joe baca dsan bernardino said immigration reform must take a backseat to more pressing problems of course i would have liked to see congress and the president make more serious legislative progress towards comprehensive immigration reform baca said in a statement but right now creating jobs and fixing our broken health insurance system must be our top priorities baca who cosponsored a bill that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants said he remains very confident obama will move forward on immigration reform once the health care issue is solved carol robb chairwoman of the county democratic party conceded that getting republicans to agree to comprehensive immigration reform will be a challenge republicans will probably hold their breath and threaten to turn blue robb said im not saying its going to be easy but its doable jose zapata calderon a professor of sociology and chicano studies at pitzer college in claremont said obama has expanded the hardline immigration policies of the bush administration workplace raids and deportations of illegal immigrants have increased since obama took office calderon said those of us who worked on the campaign are somewhat taken aback calderon said unfortunately whats happening is were not seeing anything but enforcement if that continues well see a rapid erosion of support in the latino community and other communities area latino republicans are concerned about the cost of illegal immigration joe martinez a board member for the rialto unified school district considers himself a fiscally conservative republican who believes the nations immigration laws must be enforced those here illegally should take the call against illegal immigration as a warning bell martinez said anyone who is serious about staying here should become a naturalized citizen to protect themselves and the future of their families they need to take action before washington and sacramento ask themselves the hard question of how long we can continue to support those here illegally robert rego chairman of the county republican party said the gops position on immigration must be about more than enforcement we must come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the issue in a way thats beneficial to the country as a whole rego said camarota the director of research at the center for immigration studies said latino activists will make a lot of noise but he doesnt think it will matter will obama pay any political price for his failure to bring up immigration this year no because its not a top priority for actual hispanic voters he said democrats

condition in a report of more than 1500 pages released last week the immigration courts are not courts at all in the way americans generally think of them they are part of the department of justice not the federal judiciary and the judges although they wear robes and sit in formal courtrooms are employees of the attorney general while congress has debated since 2006 an overhaul of the immigration system that would include measures to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants proposals for fixing the courts have been largely ignored but the courts have become an overwhelmed system choked by an exploding caseload said lawrence schneider an immigration lawyer at arnold porter in washington and a main author of the bar association report the report was ordered 18 months ago by the associations immigration commission a nonpartisan panel of lawyers who monitor immigration laws and recommend changes in 2008 the report found homeland security agents detained 378582 immigrants and deported more than 358000 last year the report found with enforcement continuing at a similar pace 231 immigration judges heard more than 300000 cases an average of more than 1200 for each judge or about three times the load of federal district judges judges are overworked frustrated and feel like they are on a treadmill mr schneider said immigration cases have become more complex especially asylum cases where immigrants are asking to remain in the united states because they claim to fear lifethreatening violence if they return home with the pace of their work accelerating immigration judges often feel asylum hearings are like holding death penalty cases in traffic court said dana l marks an immigration judge in san francisco and the president of the national association of immigration judges despite their relatively fast performance immigration judges backlogs are growing the report found leaving more immigrants stranded in costly detention while they await hearings as a result of the pressure for speedy decisions the number of decisions that were appealed to the federal circuit courts has swelled from 9 percent of decisions in 2002 to 26 percent in 2008 the report found in appeals courts in new york and california states with large numbers of immigrants cases from the immigration courts made up more than onethird of the dockets over the past five years the report found the increase in cases also brought more complaints from lawyers and advocates that judges working for the justice department were inclined to favor the government there have been increasing concerns about the propriety of housing a neutral court in the law enforcement arm of the government judge marks said in the proposal adopted monday the bar association argued that immigration courts should be removed from the department of justice and set up as independent courts still within the executive branch under terms in article i of the constitution the highest judges would be appointed by the president and approved by the senate the courts decisions would still be appealed to the federal appeals courts judges and lawyers said the independent courts would have greater credibility and more power to seek funds from congress leading to more resources for judges shorter terms of detention for immigrants and fewer appeals to federal circuit courts which are highly costly in 2006 attorney general alberto r gonzales acknowledging the demands on the immigration courts announced a plan to add 40 new judges but as of late last year only 9 had been named last week attorney general eric h holder jr sought to financing to add 21 more judges the american immigration lawyers association the immigration bar said on monday that it would review the

412 of 997 documents the oklahoman oklahoma city ok february 8 2010 monday city edition some claim oklahoma county profited from keeping detainees longer immigrant jail time studied byline vallery brown staff writer br vbrownopubcocom section news pg 1a length 927 words hundreds of illegal immigrants stayed in the oklahoma county jail nearly twice as long as the national average before being removed in 2008 because of problems this is according to a recent report released by the syracuse university project transactional records access clearinghouse its a pretty good revenue enhancer if there are extra cells said stan inman former district 3 county commissioner the federal government pays more to the jail than the state or city to house its prisoners mark myers spokesman for oklahoma county sheriff john whetsel said money had nothing to do with why they were there so long when someone commits a crime the system is in place for them to be dealt with in the courts then the federal government determines what happens he said but whetsel implemented a hiring freeze shortly after the removal of the prisoners citing a potential loss of as much as 32 million a year in lost revenue at the time the county was being reimbursed 4233 per day by the federal government for each federal prisoner this compares to about 30 per inmate held for the oklahoma corrections department and 4066 for those held for oklahoma city inman said the federal immigration system is rife with problems and is notoriously slow in how it deals with jails but reimbursement money received from the federal government went into the sheriffs special revenuecash funds while the county paid for daily expenses im not saying he profited by it but it could give him surplus revenue inman said its alarming that the length of detention is significantly higher said t douglas stump an immigration attorney with more than 25 years of experience working in immigration law stump said he frequently encounters detained immigrants who have been misled about where they are in the process of dealing with immigration officials he said this can affect the persons length of stay in the jail stump wouldnt speculate on blame for the longer detentions at the county jail in the 12 months leading up to the august 2008 removal of 160 federal inmates from the oklahoma county jail about 2000 immigration detainees went through the jail oklahoma county lost its status with immigration officials due to civil rights abuses and deplorable conditions there according to a federal justice department report myers said jail officials had nothing to do with the detention length cited in the report he said the jail has been operating without federal inmates and has made do without those reimbursements but were at a point now that one of the things we have to do is come up with more funding to run the jail he said carl rusnok spokesman for us immigration and customs enforcement said there are many factors that determine a detainees length of stay including immigration court backlogs communication between jail and immigration officials and drawn out legal matters its not all dependent on what happens at ice rusnok said tulsa has federal deal the tulsa county sheriffs department began contracting with the federal government to house immigration detainees in 2007 the department is one of 63 jails in the country and the only one in oklahoma that has an agreement with federal immigration officials sgt shannon clark public information officer for the tulsa county sheriffs department also supervises the immigration enforcement program there he said nearly 3800 detainees were processed in 2009 under the jails agreement with immigration officials they are reimbursed 5413 per federal detainee held there each day data contained in the report on oklahoma county is not yet available for the tulsa county jail clark said noncriminal offenders leave the jail in a few days and some complicated immigration cases can go on for years the transactional records access clearinghouse group studied millions of federal immigration records tracking immigration detainees dating back from 1998 through 2009 at a glance detention process in immigration when an illegal immigrant is taken into custody there are several ways to proceed if a person from mexico or canada is detained for their immigration status and has no criminal background they can voluntarily return to their home country at the expense of the federal government this typically happens within a matter of days when a detainee has a criminal background and the federal government determines it is going to remove the detainee the government begins paperwork for deportation the official removal of someone from the country for either criminal or immigration reasons detained people from nonneighboring countries must apply for travel documents through that countrys government every country is different on response times other situations can occur where federal government officials allow detainees to leave on their own recognizance the length of time people are detained for immigration status often comes down to whether the detainees choose to voluntarily return to their country or contest their immigration status complicated immigration court cases can take as long as three years those determined by immigration officials not to be a flight risk can be allowed to post bail immigration officials in the state can make this decision few people use this avenue primarily because of a lack of financial

5 of 997 documents financial times londonengland june 25 2002 tuesday london edition 1 the benefits of openness economic models fall short in assessing the effects of immigration ed crookes theory and practice byline by ed crooks section inside track pg 14 length 947 words in the debate on immigration currently rumbling in the us and raging in europe business generally comes down on the side of greater openness for most employers the merits of being able to draw from a bigger pool of labour seem selfevident economists however would be more cautious how you feel about immigration will depend on who you are and what you do and on who the immigrants are too some of the most influential recent academic work on immigration has been done by george borjas now at the kennedy school of government at harvard his simple model of the labour market assumes a fixed demand for labour immigration raises the supply of labour so real wages fall and profits rise which must have some connection to business leaders enthusiasm although native workers then earn less their losses are more than offset by the rise in returns to capital so overall national income is higher indeed the greater the effect of immigration on wages the bigger is the benefit to national income however calculations based on reasonably accurate figures for the extent of immigration and the sensitivity of wages in the us suggest the size of the effect may not be enormous prof borjas estimates in 1994 were that the total gains to the us from immigration were only about dollars 6bn pounds 4bn a year a mere 01 per cent of us gross domestic product and certainly less than dollars 20bn the redistribution caused by immigration is greater than the net gain the same assumptions for the us suggest that native workers lose about dollars 114bn a year owing to immigration about 19 per cent of gdp while investors gain dollars 120bn given the social strains caused by such significant redistribution and the fact that the net fiscal effects of immigration are unclear all the estimates of the balance between the taxes paid by immigrants and the cost of the services they use are highly speculative prof borjas analysis suggests that on balance the effects on natives may be negative if that extremely simple model of the labour market is made more realistic however scepticism about immigration is tempered for example if immigration increases the spread of skills and knowledge through the economy whether because immigrants bring new ideas or simply because a larger workforce generates more connections and sparks more ideas the benefits can be much greater another refinement to the model incorporates differences in skills in the workforce in the us the wages of skilled workers are apparently more responsive to changes in supply than the wages of unskilled workers as it is the fall in wages that generates the surplus from immigration the gains will be greater if the immigrants are skilled rather than unskilled using some plausible estimates of the responsiveness of wages to labour supply the net benefit to the us of immigration could rise to more than dollars 40bn a year if only skilled workers were admitted in practice however immigrants to the us tend to be less skilled than the native population in 1998 the typical immigrant worker in the us earned 23 per cent less than the typical native worker immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s have been less skilled than those of previous waves a new paper by ximena clark of the world bank timothy hatton of essex university and jeffrey williamson of harvard examines why this may have happened the change in the origins of immigrants into the us since the second world war has been remarkable in the 1950s europeans most of them from western europe formed more than half the total by the 1990s they were down to just 5 per cent in the 1900s they had been 92 per cent the proportions from developing countries have risen accordingly with the share from the caribbean peaking in the 1970s and that from asia in the 1980s the shares of immigration from mexico africa and eastern europe continue to increase this has not been a deliberate act of policy the 1965 reform of immigration law put a strong priority on family reunification ahead of employment as a justification for legal immigration it was argued at the time that because the existing stock of immigrants was largely european the flow of new immigrants would be too clark hatton and williamson set up a model of worldwide migration to the us to see why that argument has turned out to be so wrong the answer seems to be that whatever a countrys immigration policy may be people will come only if they want to with each passing decade since the war europeans have grown less needy the majority of immigrants to the us have come from the countries closest to the us which have had the highest proportions of young people and have offered the worst economic opportunities one conclusion is that although the us might be better off if it accepted only skilled immigrants cutting off unskilled immigration could cut off immigration altogether several countries have changed immigration requirements in attempts to increase the supply of skilled workers but found they were not an attractive enough prospect to attract the immigrants they wanted as prof borjas says immigration is about much more than the financial considerations it touches on the most important questions of justice human rights and conflicting political interests the case for open immigration will have to be made on those arguments as well as the economics edcrooksftcom the economic benefits from immigration gj borjas nber working paper 4955 december 1994 where do us immigrants

llorente staff writer north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 815 words the groups name is you dont speak for me and the fledgling organization is against illegal immigration but this coalition of hispanics which has a presence in new jersey is already drawing fire from a growing chorus of immigration advocates questioning who really speaks for you dont speak for me the group was created by the nations most powerful lobbying organization for strict immigration policies the federation for american immigration reform fair which is based in washington dc also sends out the groups emails and lists its own officers as the groups spokesmen its a front group for fair says douglas rivlin of the national immigration forum an advocacy group in washington dc antiimmigrant groups have been controlling the debate on immigration for most of the last decade or so now theyre increasingly worried that their dominant role on this issue is eroding fair scoffs at the criticism and says it is merely lending support to hispanics from around the nation who share its views on immigration and who want another hispanic voice heard these are people who wanted to make sure that both sides of the immigration debate were represented said susan wysoki a spokeswoman for fair and the contact on you dont speak for me press releases they were all doing their own thing to support immigration control we just wanted to facilitate their coming together she said the criticism about fairs role in the creation of you dont speak for me particularly vexes the hispanics who belong to it you dont speak for me members strongly condemn illegal immigration they call for strict enforcement of immigration laws and the passage of additional hardline measures they denounce congressional proposals that would allow some people who are here illegally to obtain legal status you dont speak for me says that its members truly represent hispanics on the issue of illegal immigration they say it is their group not the protesters who have dominated the headlines this year who more accurately reflect hispanic americans the media image is that the latino community is in favor of illegal immigration said miguel cruz a newark resident and a member of the new coalition but that image is erroneous hispanics dont all think the same way those of us who are us citizens who are here legally love this country and the fact that its a country of laws we think that to force your way into another country is wrong you shouldnt get amnesty we should close the border entirely he takes offense at the notion that he and other members of the coalition are being used as props yes the coalition is fairs creation its their mission but the truth is that without us they cant do it cruz said they tell us theres a press conference and they finance the travel and other expenses but they dont tell us what to say they do not intrude the coalitions chairman albert rodriguez who lives in arizona grows passionate when assailing illegal immigration rodriguez a military veteran said he was looking to form a coalition of likeminded hispanics and he embraced fairs assistance when it was offered i had spoken to a couple of american hispanics and i said look theyre trying to lump us with these guys and implying that were all for these illegal activities of illegal aliens i said we have to do something about this we have to start telling people that these protesters marching with illegal aliens dont speak for me thanks to fair rodriguez said hispanics who favor stricter immigration enforcement are joining forces he said more than 1000 people have joined the group via its web site you dont speak for me members concede that the group is meant to challenge the notion that opposition to illegal immigration is rooted in bigotry if youre a european white speaking against illegal immigration youre automatically considered racist said carmen morales perez a you dont speak for me member who lives in woodbridge and so she said hispanics speaking out are heard more than other people because then the race card is removed and its just about what theyre saying in an opinion piece for a community newspaper in nevada emma sepulveda a professor at the university of nevada questions the strategy of pitting latinos against each other once you begin to read more about such groups and their connections you almost always find some of the most virulent antiimmigrant organizations behind their efforts groups such as fair she said organizations such as fair are making

160 of 997 documents the record bergen county nj january 5 2006 thursday all editions nationwide protests will target illegal immigration byline by elizabeth llorente staff writer north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 964 words theyre tired of illegal immigration of people who they say make a mockery of us laws and drive down wages so on saturday morning immigration control activists are joining in a nationwide demonstration stop the invasion coordinated to take place near sites where day laborers congregate to call for tougher enforcement of immigration laws and tighter patrolling of us borders some 36 groups will protest in about 20 states including new jersey say national organizers we want to preserve our country for everyone said ron bass founder of united patriots of america an essex countybased group that is organizing the new jersey protest for legal immigrants as well as other americans we want to send a message to illegal aliens that youre in this country illegally youre breaking our laws said bass who is planning to hold the protest in bergen county a magnet for day laborers over the last decade he refused to disclose the exact location out of concern that proimmigrant activists would try to undermine his groups plans new jersey has the nations fifthlargest immigrant population and increasingly draws illegal immigrants because of its many ethnic communities and plentiful jobs in such areas as restaurants construction and landscaping the population of illegal immigrants in the state has been estimated at 300000 to 500000 they come mostly from spanishspeaking countries particularly mexico guatemala and el salvador among others the nationwide protest is being coordinated by the connecticut citizens for immigration control a group that advocates closing us borders and deporting illegal immigrants one of its founders paul streitz said the demonstration is meant to call attention to illegal immigration at a time when congress is poised to discuss major immigration reform proposals nationally coordinated protests usually are staged by proimmigration advocates those on the opposing side tend to be less public fearing retaliation and usually draw much smaller crowds to their events but immigration control groups have grown bolder as theyve seen a conservative momentum build in washington backing tougher border enforcement recent polls show many americans believe some illegal immigrants should have a chance to become legal but they also think the us government has been too lax in controlling the borders so in an important election year many in congress are making immigration a cause célèbre on the more liberal end some bills call for legalizing illegal immigrants who pass a certain set of criteria and providing temporary visas for foreigners to do jobs that are hard to fill with americans on the conservative end other bills call for making illegal immigration a felony and giving local police more powers to arrest people for being here illegally some of those bills have been called the most draconian immigration measures in recent us history like many immigrationcontrol proponents streitz says that simply enforcing existing laws would be enough to solve many of the problems associated with illegal immigration additional laws will help but what good would they be if theres no enforcement he asked we already have many strong laws angela kelley deputy director of the national immigration forum a washington dcbased proimmigrant group says the system needs to change but that tougher enforcement alone is not the answer we do have a broken immigration system kelley said but what we need is to control immigration in a realistic and effective way that gives people who are deserving legal channels through which to come here all these years weve thrown more and more money at border control and we just have more illegal immigrants than ever she said another immigration advocate is condemning the protests as racist these people have to face that our country has supported many of the governments that have created instability that force these people to leave their countries said esther chavez a community activist for american friends service committee in newark who often assists day laborers how can we just ignore that connection illegal immigrants are the most exploited group in our country chavez said my goodness right now i have 29 active cases of day laborers whove been stiffed by the contractors who they did work for these people were worked to the bone and stiffed out of 42000 in wages the protest organizers are not sympathetic they are determined to take their protests to the source of their concern illegal immigrant workers because the real problem as we see it is the employment of illegal immigrants if you dry up the employment the illegals will go home streitz said thats why we going to these sites for our protest to make that point in new york protests are planned for rockland county and long island where confrontations between residents and day laborers have at times turned violent rockland county has an estimated 11000 illegal aliens who are occupying lowincome housing causing rezoning and a virtual war among mayors and town supervisors over rezoning said william tibbe of the citizens civil defense which is staging a protest in spring

429 of 997 documents san jose mercury news california august 22 2009 saturday study immigration judge as stressed out as emergency room doctors prison wardens byline by howard mintz hmintzmercurynewscom section politics special reports crime news national length 979 words on any given day immigration judge dana leigh marks can find herself listening to a wrenching tale of an immigrant seeking asylum fearing everything from torture to death if returned to his or her homeland or she could be deciding the fate of one of thousands of immigrants who find themselves facing deportation each year some of whom have been in the united states for years going to school working and raising families in a cramped corner office in san franciscos financial district the case files stacked on marks desk show the sheer volume of her task the roughly 215 immigration judges in the country last year decided an average of more than 1600 cases dwarfing the workload of a fulltime federal judge who may have about 350 cases on their docket at a time for marks and other immigration judges around the country it appears all those stories and case files are starting to take their toll in a study released this summer by university of californiasan francisco researchers immigration judges it turns out are as stressed out and burned out as emergency room doctors and prison wardens and the study found female immigration judges far more stressed than their male counterparts as us department of justice employees immigration judges ordinarily do not speak publicly but they didnt hold back with ucsf researchers one judge told researchers they have to grovel like mangy street dogs to convince top immigration officials they need more time to deal with the crushing caseloads another reported a knot in my stomach deciding asylum cases and another told researchers i cant take this place anymore what a dismal job this is the study does not entirely surprise marks president of the national association of immigration judges shes now using the findings to push for longsought reforms to the system including a proposal for the immigration courts to break from justice department oversight the depth and the severity is what was surprising marks said of the study its gotten a lot worse a lot faster immigration courts have come under closer scrutiny in recent years as caseloads exploded across the country the number of immigration cases jumped from more than 282000 in 1998 to a projected 385000 this year with only a modest increase in the number of immigration judges northern californias immigration judges are based in san francisco federal appeals courts which often review the work of the immigration courts have grown increasingly frustrated with some of the justice dispensed a mercury news review three years ago found a san franciscobased federal appeals court was regularly overturning the immigration courts in the most important immigration matters it decided a spokeswoman of the executive office of immigration review which runs the immigration court system for the justice department said officials are aware of the recent study and working to address its findings which included recommendations to provide far more resources to immigration judges elaine komis the eoir spokeswoman said 19 new judges are being hired this year and the department is asking for 28 more judges in 2010 and during a weeklong training session for all the judges earlier this month in washington dc one segment included stress management but the findings of widespread stress and burnout in the study are cause for concern among immigration rights advocates who worry that frustrated overworked immigration judges are too often giving short shrift to immigrants in their courtrooms experts such as karen musalo a hastings college of the law professor and leading asylum lawyer say there are ample numbers of judges who dont deserve sympathy because there are judges that just shouldnt be there but musalo and others say many judges are wellintentioned but overburdened in particular department pressure to push judges to decide immigration cases quickly and erase backlogs has aggravated the tension in the system according to experts were driven by numbers statistics said gilbert gembacz who retired last year as an immigration judge in los angeles after 12 years on his court the bean counters have taken over bay area immigration lawyers recently provided the san francisco judges with a survey of their performance and the main concern in those findings which are not public was ensuring judges remain patient and empathetic to the rights of the immigrants a lot of these judges appear easily frustrated said philip hwang who runs the asylum program for the san francisco lawyers committee for civil rights and summarized the survey the ucsf study identified asylum cases as a leading cause of stress for the immigration judges because of the stakes involved and the limited resources to fully examine asylum claims were dealing with death penalty cases in a traffic court setting marks said on an ordinary day in immigration court most asylum cases unfold behind closed doors one at a time a government lawyer shooed a reporter out of marks courtroom on a recent day earlier this month as the judge considered the asylum petition of an afghan woman down the hall more routine hearings involving deportation matters unfolded in the courtroom of judge lawrence di costanzo who plowed through a calendar of cases speaking slowly into a microphone to produce recordings of the proceedings there was little sign of stress in the small antiseptic courtroom but most of the hearings were routine matters far from resolution for the judges and the system the stress comes later when the decision is made on whether an immigrant can stay in the country or must be sent away youre dealing with someones life said

this is going to be a very tough fight lofgren said theres a reason it hasnt been done yet and thats because its hard to do the fight for healthcare reform seems to be delaying if not overshadowing

anyone expected and he lauded the work of lofgren and sen chuck schumer dny who is drafting legislation to present to congress after labor day proimmigration activists say the legislation must be

security secretary janet napolitano early in the summer to be the administrations point person for the debate the president however told hispanic reporters at the white house on friday that next years

439 of 997 documents the new york times june 3 2009 wednesday late edition final bill proposes immigration rights for gay couples byline by julia preston section section a column 0 national desk pg 19 length 1107 words senator patrick j leahy the democrat from vermont who is the powerful chairman of the judiciary committee is adding another controversial ingredient to the volatile mix of an immigration debate that president obama has said he hopes to spur in congress before the end of the year mr leahy has offered a bill that would allow american citizens and legal immigrants to seek residency in the united states for their samesex partners just as spouses now petition for foreignborn husbands and wives the senator has said the bill should be part of any broad immigration legislation that congress considers to highlight his initiative known as the uniting american families act mr leahy is holding a hearing on wednesday to discuss it in the full judiciary committee bypassing the usual subcommittee hearings also this week immigrant advocacy groups and labor organizations are opening a nationwide campaign to hold president obama to his recent pledge to initiate a congressional debate on immigration legislation later this year smallscale rallies took place on monday in los angeles and some 40 other locations and immigration groups are converging on washington on wednesday for three days of strategy meetings the obama administration juggling an array of huge and pressing issues on the economy and health care reform has encouraged the mobilization of immigration advocates especially latino groups while avoiding any legislative battles for now on the prickly topic of immigration president obama has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the white house next monday to launch a policy conversation about immigration an administration official said the president wants to identify areas of agreement and areas where we still have work to do said the official who would only speak on background because the final plans for the meeting were not settled the most contentious part of the immigration legislation that the administration supports which is known as comprehensive immigration reform is a program to give legal status to more than 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country but current proposals also include a variety of measures intended like senator leahys to expand or streamline the legal immigration system mr leahys proposal for samesex immigration benefits was not included in the immigration legislation that the bush administration brought forward in 2007 which failed after a firestorm of opposition mainly from republican voters groups backing the overhaul this year have cobbled together a wideranging but fragile coalition that includes latino and black groups roman catholic and evangelical christian churches farm workers and commercial farmers and some employer groups in contrast to 2007 organized labor is united this time around in supporting the overhaul the political fault lines opened by senator leahys samesex bill quickly became apparent this week in a letter sent tuesday bishop john c wester of salt lake city the chairman of the catholic bishops committee on migration wrote that the uniting american families act would erode the institution of marriage and family by taking a position that is contrary to the very nature of marriage which predates the church and the state bishop wester addressed his letter to representative michael m honda a california democrat who has said he will introduce an immigration bill containing similar samesex provisions in the house this week j kevin appleby the immigration policy director for the bishops conference said the last thing the national immigration debate needs is another politically divisive issue added to the mix but senator leahy said the bill would eliminate discrimination in immigration law against gay and lesbian couples under family unification provisions in immigration law american citizens and legal residents can petition for residency for their spouses there is no numerical limit on permanent residence visas known as green cards for spouses of american citizens and this is one of the main channels for legal immigration to the united states samesex couples though cannot petition for partners and many face the prospect of an immigrant partners deportation senator leahys bill would add the term permanent partner to sections of current immigration law that refer to married couples and would provide a legal definition of those terms i just think its a matter of fairness he said tuesday in an interview noting that a number of american allies including canada france and germany recognize samesex couples in immigration law the judiciary committee is to hear testimony on wednesday from shirley tan 43 the mother of twin 12yearold boys who are united states citizens because they were born here ms tan has raised them with her partner of 20 years jay mercado who like ms tan is from the philippines although ms mercado became a naturalized american citizen in 1998 she has not been able to gain legal immigration status for ms tan ms tan said she came to this country fleeing a cousin who was released from prison in the philippines after he served 10 years for the murders of her mother and her sister ms tan said she had been severely injured in the 1979 attack by the cousin she applied for political asylum in the united states she said but did not receive notice when it was denied years later she remained here with a provisional legal status until last jan 28 when federal immigration agents carrying a deportation order came to the home she shares with ms mercado 48 in pacifica calif since her arrest ms tan has been able to remain legally in the country because of a private bill introduced on her behalf by senator dianne feinstein democrat of california ms tan said she feared returning to live in the philippines in part because of concern that she and ms mercado would face antigay discrimination there people are cruel she said i dont know if i can expose my boys to narrowminded people opponents of the leahy bill argue that it would foster immigration fraud because it would be difficult for immigration officers to determine whether samesex couples had an established relationship supporters said the bill would assist about 36000 samesex couples nationwide rachel b tiven the executive director of immigration equality a group that advocates for gay rights legislation said the bill had improved chances this year because of recent samesex marriage victories in iowa maine and vermont url httpwwwnytimescom loaddate june 3 2009 language english

162 of 997 documents national posts financial post fp investing canada august 25 2004 wednesday national edition to each his immigration system byline alan g green financial post section financial post comment pg fp15 length 857 words since the september 11 terrorist attacks there has been increasing discussion in policy circles about integrating canadian and us labour markets such a move would require the harmonization of our immigration policies but since our own immigration policy has served us well in the past and gives every indication of doing so in the future canada should reject any move toward adopting us rules at first glance the integration of north american labour markets has some appeal when economic conditions in the united states improve relative to canadas labour would move freely to take up the us jobs and vice versa economic theory suggests this free flow of labour is optimal for the efficient operation of the two labour markets these conclusions fit well in a pictureperfect theoretical world but we live in the real world and the existence of largescale immigration into both countries complicates this picture labour market integration would require creating a single set of rules governing the admission of immigrants to north america without a single set of rules for example it would be impossible for one country to close its borders to immigration since migrants would simply enter via the other country and move to the one that had shut its doors since the second world war the united states has consistently admitted more than six times as many immigrants as canada this numerical imbalance makes it likely that us immigration rules would dominate the shape of any harmonized policy the question then is would this matter in answering this question it is useful to ask what if canada had adopted us immigration policy at the beginning of the 20th century and stuck with it since then would such a decision have made any difference to canadian longterm economic and social development the short answer is that it would have had substantial negative effects harmonization would have decreased economic growth accentuated shortterm fluctuations in unemployment and limited our ability to use immigration as a social policy tool canadian immigration policy since the immigration act of 1910 has aimed to meet the short and longrun economic needs of the country for example immigration policy during the opening decades of the last century was aimed almost exclusively at populating the canadian west as quickly as possible after the second world war the country again turned to immigration to meet the needs of a rapidly growing economy in recent years immigration policy has concentrated on augmenting the skill base of the canadian labour force immigrants played a crucial role in lowering adjustment costs by moving into expanding sectors and out of declining areas more rapidly than did their nativeborn counterparts us immigration policy followed a very different path the quota act of 1924 lowered total annual inflow to about 150000 a year essentially closing the door on immigration more importantly us policy focused significantly on family reunification a policy that holds as much today as it did 80 years ago in 2002 only 16 of us immigrants were admitted for economic reasons compared to 60 in canada this noneconomic policy would have imposed serious constraints on canadian economic development canadian immigration policy is also much more flexible than its us counterpart for almost a century canada has regulated the inflow of immigrants on the basis of shortrun economic conditions when domestic unemployment is low the tap is turned on and when economic conditions are poor the tap is closed this defining feature of canadian immigration policy is known as absorptive capacity but us immigration policy lacks this capacity to respond to shortrun needs since over the long run it has set low annual intake levels this approach would not have worked for canada as a small open economy we needed the flexibility to respond quickly to changing commodity demands and to technological change canadian immigration policy has been highly innovative over the past century and harmonization would have limited the concomitant benefits the best example is the development of the point system which sets out objective measures age education professional experience etc by which to judge the admissibility of prospective immigrants this has proved to be a powerful economic policy tool to shift toward a greater share of skilled workers the united states has made no move toward adopting any type of policy that would increase the share of skilled foreignborn workers entering the country as canada faces a looming shortage of skilled labour in the next 10 years the adoption of us regulations would not be in our longterm interests past experience shows canadas immigration policy is superior to its southern neighbours in terms of its economic focus shortterm flexibility and innovative capacity as appealing as labour market harmonization may appear immigration accounts for 60 of our current population growth it is imperative that we not surrender control over this powerful tool of social and economic development loaddate august 25 2004 language english documenttype business opinion

over whether omaha police should help enforce federal immigration laws daub said he favors police playing a strong role while suttle said he would not make it a priority both men said police should notify federal authorities when they arrest someone who is an illegal immigrant suttle triggered the immigration debate last month when he told a neighborhood gathering that the united states is the only country that has it all wrong on immigration he said the nation accomplishes little by criminalizing illegal immigrants or businesses that employ illegal immigrants daub said suttles comments show that he would not enforce the nations immigration laws in an interview suttle responded that immigration was a federal issue while he would enforce all laws as mayor he would not make the detention of illegal immigrants a priority im not interested in having the omaha police department take over the duties of the fbi or the immigration services suttle said daub said suttle was trying to explain away his immigration views hes trying to blow smoke and obfuscate what he said in 10 days voters will choose daub or suttle as omahas 50th mayor the election is set for may 12 immigration historically has been a federal responsibility the federal government oversees the nations borders and the deportation of illegal immigrants increasingly state and local governments have been passing or considering ordinances to deal with immigration for example a group of citizens in fremont is pushing an ordinance that would make it illegal for businesses to hire and landlords to rent to illegal immigrants suttle made the original comments after he was asked whether he would allow omaha police officers to help enforce immigration laws in some cities mayors sign statements saying they will help us immigration and customs enforcement the enforcement arm of federal immigration services generally not he told the questioner because it will suck up all the resources we want to get parks done streets done or anything else we need to get the united states congress to do what it hasnt done for 40 years thats put a policy in place that works for companies and for immigrants we need to go to the source of the problem and quit making criminals out of the companies quit making criminals out of people however they might come across the border suttle continued europe does it the right way asia does it the right way were the only country that does it the wrong way daub said the statements indicated that suttle favored amnesty for illegal immigrants clearly what he said and what he meant was that he wants to make illegal immigration legal he said he also is clearly opposed to omaha cooperating with federal officials to fight illegal immigration daub said he favors police helping to enforce immigration laws whenever officers encounter illegal immigrants during the normal course of their workday suttle said police should notify federal authorities if they arrest someone who is an illegal immigrant as for his comments about america getting it wrong suttle said they were based on his experience working with hdr inc the omahabased engineering company that has an international program other countries allow companies to recruit outside workers if they are sponsored by a citizen and if they have a particular expertise needed by the company suttle said it makes it very simple it makes everything legal he said why go into punitive things and have people in violation of the laws when we can find other ways to make it work he added suttle did not suggest how the federal government should overhaul immigration laws he said his focus is on creating jobs and reducing crime suttle said daub is trying to hide his own record on immigration daub voted against a 1986 immigration overhaul package when he was in the us house the bill was pushed by thenpresident ronald reagan the proposal toughened penalties on businesses that knowingly hired illegal immigrants it also provided a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants living in the country an estimated 27 million people were granted citizenship under the 1986 law hal is using this immigration issue to criticize me when hes covering up his own positions on immigration suttle said daub said he is proud of his vote against the bill several us cities have become socalled sanctuary cities thats when city employees are prohibited from asking about a persons immigration status for example police would not be able to ask a rape victim if she were legally in the country daub and suttle said they oppose omaha becoming a sanctuary city the city needs to enforce the laws suttle said when someone gets arrested and it turns out theyre undocumented they should be turned over to federal authorities

by the economic slump reform leaders say they were relieved by recent reports that obama who will meet today with mexican president felipe calderon plans to speak publicly about the issue in may and will press lawmakers from both parties to begin discussing legislation by the fall we know that good will and promises in this politically charged atmosphere are not going to be enough said juan jose gutierrez spokesman for the los angelesbased full rights for immigrants coalition the white house has downplayed reports that the administration would push for immigration reform as early as next month clarifying that while the issue is important dealing with the economic crisis is the top priority obama has said he supports a combination of enforcing laws and opening up the system he wants to see a path for citizenship that would mean requiring an illegal immigrant to pay a fine learn english and then get in line for citizenship immigration advocates say they plan to continue pressing the issue with activities that will culminate with may day marches and rallies planned for several cities immigration reformers also used the holy week activities to distribute thousands of postcards preaddressed to obama urging immigration legislation parishioners at southern california churches were asked to sign the postcard and mail them to the white house at a news conference last week at the los angeles federal building immigration activists displayed a large banner showing the countdown to the end of the first 100 days of the obama presidency the time frame in which obama promised to introduce comprehensive legislation to amend current laws we are surprised nothing has been sent to congress on immigration reform because the president was very explicit in saying that he would do so

be evaluating how us immigration policy impacts the american worker not parading around the country trying to lay the groundwork for mass amnesty said dan stein president of fair obama skeptics waiting some latino studies experts say the concern among immigration activists that the new president has held back on legislative reform is wellfounded we had reason to believe and hope that obama was serious when he promised immigration reform early in his administration said jorge garcia a chicano studies professor at california state university northridge but he has so many other things to deal with that it seems that immigration has gotten lost in the shuffle while in southern california last month obama renewed his support for comprehensive reform including a possible path to citizenship for otherwise lawabiding immigrants who entered the country illegally along the lines of the bill that stalled in congress in 2007 but a fight over immigration reform say political experts could be difficult for the president and democrats and could become a rallying point for republicans to mobilize political outrage against any effort to protect illegal immigrant workers while so many americans are out of work there never will be a good time for immigration reform and for obama there could be a better time and he wanted to make it a secondyear issue said jaime regalado director of the edmund g pat brown institute of public affairs at california state university los angeles and a close observer of latino politics immigration reformers agree but are mindful that hispanics gave

staff writer north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 987 words presidential candidates barack obama and john mccain have barely touched on last years hottest national issue immigration activists on both sides of the debate have assailed the near absence of the issue in the campaign saying it seems too much of a hot potato for either candidate while the economy is they say justifiably eclipsing all else they add that immigration had been ignored by both candidates long before the financial crisis for the top two people running to lead this country not to address this issue which is integral not only to the us economy but the future character of this nation is unconscionable said englewood mayor michael wildes an immigration attorney who sits on gov jon s corzines blue ribbon advisory panel on immigrant policy a spokesman for obama said the senators disproportionate focus on the economy simply is a response to voters priorities its been bubbling up andrew poag spokesman for obamas campaign in new jersey said of the economic crisis but in morristown mayor donald cresitello who favors strict immigration policies said candidates should not ignore other important matters in the past year cresitello has been one of the countrys most vocal officials on the burden that federal inaction on illegal immigration has put on local communities no one is saying they should not be focusing on the economy cresitello said adding its absurd to think that the candidates and the country should only focus on one issue at a time immigration and the economy are by the way interconnected theres an underground economy immigrant workers are being exploited for the security of our country too we need to address immigration we need to know whos here 500000 in nj an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants live in the united states about a halfmillion in new jersey a comprehensive immigration reform measure that would have tightened enforcement and provided a path to legalization failed to win approval in congress last year amid partisan battling as efforts to address reform at the federal level ran into dead ends state and local officials have taken the matter into their own hands many have proposed or adopted ordinances that punish landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and suspend the licenses of small businesses that hire them most such efforts however foundered when challenged in court immigration is a federal matter but local communities are shouldering the challenges wildes said and all there is from the candidates and federal government is inaction and a deafening silence americans for legal immigration a lobby that wants strict immigration enforcement got so fed up with the scant attention paid to illegal immigration by both candidates that last week it launched a web site called obamaandmccainstinkcom which offers disillusioned voters bumper stickers buttons and yard signs that declare both obama and mccain stink in their voting records and web sites obama and mccain have expressed similar views on immigration issues leading many observers to complain theres no distinct choice obama and mccain agree with many key provisions in the illfated comprehensive immigration reform bill of last year both support stricter enforcement of immigration laws as well as beefing up security along the nations borders at the same time theyve also said they support a path to legalization for illegal immigrants who have otherwise broken no laws while living in the us conservatives fume the dual approach of enforcement and a chance at legalization sits well with many democrats but the most conservative faction of the republican party has condemned mccain for his support of a path to legalization which they denounce as amnesty for lawbreakers mccain angered the staunchest conservatives in his party when he cosponsored an ambitious immigration reform bill with sen ted kennedy dmass in 2005 that called for legalization for some undocumented immigrants a guest worker program aimed at filling jobs that employers say they cannot find americans to do and enhanced border security his partnership on the bill considered landmark legislation received kudos from immigration advocacy groups and ethnic communities that tend to see the gop as antiimmigrant although it never became law it influenced subsequent proposals but those same groups expressed anger after mccain last year began distancing himself from provisions in reform bills that were seen as going easy on illegal immigrants and started focusing more on strict enforcement of the border hes in a very difficult bind said amy gottlieb of american friends service committee in newark until his campaign for president he was one of the republicans most willing to engage in a real dialogue on immigration policy now he just says we must first control the border before we talk about anything else about immigration immigration advocates favor obama who in littlepublicized speeches and on his web site has adopted a tone of sympathy for undocumented immigrants and their families who often include us citizens mccain the enforcer those who favor strict enforcement say that despite his unpopular past stances on immigration mccain would be more effective than obama at repairing the countrys broken immigration system it does concern me that he was an author on the socalled amnesty bill said gayle kesselman cochairwoman of the new jersey concerned citizens for immigration control but he did say he understands that enforcement and border security have to come first if youre on a fishing boat that has holes you plug the holes first you stop the hemorrhaging said kesselman of carlstadt then you look at what is best to do about some of the 12

the presidential political debate groups supporting and opposing changes in immigration policy are intensifying their efforts to bring about change once a new administration and congress come to washington activists on both sides of the immigration divide agree that the selection of senator john mccain as the republican presidential nominee sidelined the immigration debate although republicans and democrats have fiercely argued the issue mccains views on immigration are closer to those of his rival senator barack obama than to the republican party line given this odd political alignment neither side seems to have an interest in moving immigration issues to the top of the debate an immigration raid that took place may 12 at the postville iowa kosher meatprocessing plant agriprocessors in which nearly 400 employees were arrested drew attention to the plight of undocumented workers and helped galvanize supporters of immigration reform who advocate opening america to more legal immigrants and to finding ways to legalize undocumented workers who are already here at a september 14 midwest interfaith immigration summit in columbus ohio members of 20 different faiths from throughout the region discussed ways that communities can mobilize to push forward immigration reform by strengthening ties with immigrant workers and by training leaders of faith groups in advocacy the hebrew immigrant aid societys president and ceo gideon aronoff who attended the interfaith gathering said that the appeal to grassroots support developed after congress failed to pass immigration reform proreform groups were strong but not organized well enough our greatest lesson was that we need to expand and deepen our outreach aronoff said hias would like to begin to move beyond washington advocacy to grassroots operations after the postville raid hias received requests from local communities across the nation to arrange meetings and discussions on immigration agriprocessors was a clarion call for the jewish community aronoff said an issue that we are used to thinking about in the philosophical level suddenly actually hit us where we eat the significance of immigration issues was echoed by many jewish groups that were active in the failed 2008 attempt to persuade congress to adopt immigration reform legislation now these groups feel reinvigorated the union for reform judaism adopted a resolution september 15 expressing dismay at the way undocumented workers were treated during the postville raid rabbi marla feldman director of the commission on social action of reform judaism said that the postville events underscored the need for a change of policy the current immigration system creates an underground network of immigrants and prevents them from defending themselves against abuse and from stepping out of the shadows feldman said also flexing their muscles are some conservative radio talkshow hosts who oppose liberal immigration policies

national media director ira mehlman fairs work was criticized by the antidefamation league which has been tracking the work of antiimmigration organizations the adl argues that despite fairs statements that it wants to solve problems of illegal immigration fair is using stereotypes of immigrants to fight open immigration they basically oppose the entry of latinos to this country said marilyn mayo codirector of the adls center on extremism she says that while fair is not among the extreme antiimmigration groups its ties with lawmakers are worrisome we are concerned that the rhetoric of groups like fair will seep into the mainstream discussion mayo added mehlman said that jewish groups such as the adl are disconnected from what ordinary jewish people are feeling american jews see these issues on a daily basis its their tax dollars that have to pay for the illegal immigrants and their health insurance premiums that increase in order to cover the uninsured mehlman said

457 of 997 documents the orange county register california september 7 2008 sunday 1 edition an answer to illegal immigration let them in byline by alan w bock senior editorial writer by alan w bock senior editorial writer section commentary pg rebuth length 838 words immigration has not played a prominent role in this years election except early on among gop hopefuls who were marginal from the outset perhaps in part because republicans saw so many immigration restrictionists go down in flames in the process of losing control of congress in 2006 and in part because the eventual gop candidate john mccain is not a restrictionist and the party has embraced him however clumsily for fear of obama but the nativists still ply their trade on talk radio and in other venues so the urge to limit immigration and do something punitive about the 12 million or so immigrants who are here illegally is not likely to disappear i have long contended that the problem is overly restrictive immigration laws were in an economic slump just now and unemployment is edging up but for many years illegal immigration coexisted with historically low levels of unemployment suggesting strongly that immigrants legal or illegal were not taking jobs from nativeborn americans who wanted them the notion that some bureaucrat in washington knows better than employers in santa ana or san diego how many employees some business really needs is sheer folly a mere book might not change the equation but if any book deserves to have such an impact it is let them in the case for open borders by wall street journal editorial writer jason riley writing from a strongly conservative reaganite freemarket perspective while occasionally impassioned and sardonic for the most part it is a sober demolition of six of the most prominent arguments against open immigration using the most reliable studies and statistics available it demonstrates that there is simply no intellectually coherent case for restricting immigration and that in fact to restrict immigration would do this country serious harm the six arguments riley takes on are common enough the country is already overpopulated and letting more people in will degrade the quality of life for everyone and harm the environment immigrants take jobs from the nativeborn and especially harm those at the lower end of the socialeconomic spectrum immigrants are disproportionate users of welfare this wave of immigrants is uniquely dangerous to american culture and will resist assimilation into ordinary american life immigration is a shrewd wedge issue that can increase republican turnout and finally unrestricted immigration especially illegal immigration poses a serious threat to national security in this era of terrorist activity undertaken by shadowy stateless groups in his introduction riley notes that none of these arguments is new some of our most famous forebears fretted about immigration from our earliest days ben franklin railed against swarms of unassimilable germans taking over pennsylvania 250 years ago in the early 19th century the irish were the bogeymen who were going to subvert angloamerican values and prosperity then it was the chinese brought over to build railroads and do other coolie work during the period of heaviest immigration from 18901910 jews catholics and various eastern and southern europeans provoked fear that they would be a permanent underclass or would outbreed complacent natives but the arguments were wrong then and they are wrong now the united states is nowhere close to being overpopulated immigration compensates for declining birth rates and people are the ultimate resource riley argues that immigrant workers tend to act as complements to the native workforce rather than substitutes and backs it up with nuanced economic analysis immigrants legal and illegal of comparable economic classes use welfare and commit crimes at a lower rate than nativeborn americans even harvard economist george borjas who advocates immigration restriction for other reasons notes that although the presumed magnetic attraction of welfare comes up most often in the immigration debate it is also the one for which there is no empirical support mexican immigrants are assimilating at about the same rate as previous waves of immigrants the political argument is especially devastating many of the most vociferous antiimmigrant gop candidates were defeated in the republican wipeout of 2006 but using immigration as a wedge issue drove down hispanic votes for republicans which had been increasing since 1996 so far no terrorist has come across the southern border that we know of but the best way to guard against the possibility is to liberalize immigration laws so authorities can focus on potential terrorists rather than people who want to mow your lawn immigration is an emotional issue and some people seem to be immune to reasoned debate and discussion but for those who are still making up their minds and despite the noise polls show that this describes the majority of americans this book is likely to be powerfully persuasive titlelet them in the case for open borders

subject that three decades ago was a secondary technical field delegated to adjunct professors is booming at law schools nationwide elective immigration law courses taught by tenured specialists are filling lecture halls immigration clinics are expanding and student groups devoted to the subject are mushrooming the momentum is partly driven by a highprofile rancorous immigration debate but it is also the result of an era of mass immigration that has fueled demand from foreigners and businesses seeking help navigating us immigration statutes and has created a generation of law students intimately familiar with the issue often because they are children of immigrants or immigrants themselves immigration is just one part of a much broader story about globalization of movement of goods and movement of people and movement of ideas and what used to be a backwater of the law has become mainstream said t alexander aleinikoff dean of georgetown university law school who coauthored the first major immigration law casebook in 1985 this is certainly a very very hot topic unlike undergraduates law students do not pick majors so there are no statistics on the number studying immigration

the nations first moot court competition begun by new york university two years ago the university of california at davis started a second contest this year in the past three years students at the university of maryland george mason university and harvard university have founded immigration law groups at au an immigrants rights coalition formed by law students in 2005 has 50 members and has hosted a conference on a new visa category and panels of day laborers and refugees were a country of immigrants and yet were putting immigrants out said the groups cochairman amalia greenberg 29 who emigrated from venezuela at age 6 its a continuation of the civil rights movement and it feels like its in our hands to do something about it professors say the immigration law boom is part of a broader explosion of interest in human rights and international law spurred by todays globally minded students immigration is by no means the hottest law school topic criminal law and litigation remain hugely popular and environmental law is a new favorite and although practitioners ranks are growing membership in the american immigration lawyers association has nearly doubled since 2003 to more than 11000 15 percent of whom passed the bar exam within the past three years the majority of students in immigration law classes will not become immigration lawyers professors said many students said they might specialize in another area and do pro bono immigration cases on the side but there is a growing realization students and professors said that policies on issues such as asylum and due process are evolving as never before particularly since the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks a growing immigrant population also means that legal status often complicates what might have once been simple criminal or labor cases its not just that people think immigration is important but theyre seeing that it affects everything said hiroshi motomura an immigration law professor who will join ucla in the fall many students said their studies had underscored how thorny immigration is jennifer khouri recently graduated from george washington university law school as a student she successfully argued at arlington immigration court that an illegal immigrant from colombia should be allowed to stay in the united states with her young son a us citizen as proud as khouri is of that victory she is starting a job this fall as a us department of justice attorney representing the government in immigration court on both sides the reaction is too emotional theres not enough actually looking at the numbers empirical evidence about how immigrants are affecting the country said khouri 27 the daughter of a lebanese immigrant father and cuban immigrant mother the reason i want to work for the government is because i want to push for the middle the topics ultrapolitical nature frustrates some asha allam who recently took gws immigration clinic said the experience made her decide against the field because she thought the immigration system was unfair in part because of documented disparities of approval and denial rates among immigration judges stalled federal immigration legislation also means lawyers can offer little aid to illegal immigrants she said lawyers are telling a lot of their clients theres nothing we can do for you right now said allam 23 who plans to work in global trade in hopes that someday people will not have to migrate for opportunities thats not really legal advice she said the challenges have only energized karlie dunsky a gw law student unlike many of her peers she had little experience with immigrants while growing up in ohio but shes set on a career in refugee and asylum law im going to have to get used to my clients claims being denied but the first one is always hard said dunsky 24 but she said what makes immigration so compelling is that its a human issue its not some vague entity that doesnt have a face it really motivates you

byline by erin carlyle the orange county register section news pg covera length 870 words dateline santa ana abstract immigration and border reform groups reject democratic and republican presidential candidates as being liberal when it comes to their core concerns full text santa ana the tshirt said it all costa mesa resident john powelson a lifelong republican displayed his political sentiments across his chest at an antiillegal immigration meeting last week is john mccain the manchurian candidate the slogan refers to the 1962 film starring frank sinatra in which american soldiers are captured in korea taken to china and brainwashed to become unwitting communist agents powelson 57 wonders if mccains policies on guns and immigration which he sees as far too liberal are the result of a reallife manchurian incident it could very well be that he was brainwashed he said referring to mccains six years as a prisoner of war in vietnam powelson is part of a vocal orange county contingent of voters who see mccain and barack obama as too soft on illegal immigration last year mccain cosponsored a failed immigration package that would have among other things offered a path to legal status for immigrants living in the us illegally obamas position is similar for many across the country who see illegal immigration as a critical campaign issue neither major party candidate fits the bill as a result some voters will be boycotting the presidential election others will choose libertarian bob barr or republican ron paul even though paul has dropped out of the election still others may vote for chuck baldwin the american independent party candidate but louis desipio chairman of chicano and latino studies at uc irvine says immigration isnt as important to voters as activists say if you look at public opinion polls immigration is rarely at the top of list desipio said for a core of the republican party maybe 10 to 15 percent its a core issue economic issues national security personal and public safety issues are usually much higher last week american independent candidate baldwin a baptist minister from pensacola fla spoke to a receptive crowd at a california coalition for immigration reform meeting in garden grove in 1994 the huntington beachbased coalition sponsored prop 187 which would have denied illegal immigrants health care social services and public education it passed but was overturned by a federal court even after baldwins fiery speech local voters who favor tougher enforcement of immigration law doubt that any of the thirdparty candidates will make it to the white house we know theyre not going to win unless a miracle happens said chelene nightingale who runs save our state an antiillegal immigration group based in orange county she predicts obama will win instead of the presidential contest groups that fight illegal immigration are focusing on races for state and federal legislative seats quite frankly thats where the voting happens anyway nightingale said there isnt much that a president can do orange countys antiillegal immigration voters hope that santa ana school board member rosemarie avila will defeat rep loretta sanchez a democrat in the 47th congressional district and that rep dana rohrabacher a republican will fend off huntington beach mayor debbie cook to hold onto his 46th congressional district seat in los angeles immigration hardliners are supporting republican ted hayes who is seeking to unseat veteran 35th district rep maxine waters a democrat the focus on local and state races is a national trend according to william gheen president of americans for legal immigration a political action committee states can enforce federal immigration policies and congressional candidates are seen as necessary to fight the kind of sweeping change that mccain and obama would like states cracked down on illegal immigration in the first three months of 2008 44 states considered 1106 bills according to the national conference of state legislatures groups such as gheens have lobbied for state legislative packages to empower police to enforce federal immigration law as well as measures to cut off social services college access and drivers licenses for workers here illegally and require businesses to verify immigration status of their employees components of these policies have been adopted in arizona oklahoma south carolina utah and georgia were hoping to see a political meltdown in november gheen said unless you know strongly that your incumbent is not like mccain or obama on immigration throw em out roy beck president of numbers usa an organization that rates politicians on antiillegal immigration policies cites the recent ouster of rep chris cannon rutah who lost to a rookie who was tougher on

1002 words one side says the governors executive order is long overdue and the other side says carcieri chose the low road governor carcieris executive order cracking down on illegal immigration met with backlash yesterday from rhode island democratic party leaders who accused him of mandating racial profiling and from immigrant advocates who accused him of scapegoating and inflaming the debate it was the talk of talk radio positive and negative the executive order the governor signed thursday will empower state police and correctional officers to enforce some immigration laws through an agreement with the federal bureau of immigration and customs enforcement it will require electronic verification of the legal status of employees who work for the executive branch and employees of vendors who do business with the state tim grilo executive director of the rhode island democratic party accused carcieri of staging another meaningless media orchestration that was closer to a hate rally than a press conference doesnt the governor understand that hundreds of thousands of immigrants have legally come to rhode islands borders for the past two centuries and have greatly contributed to our society grilo said rather than holding a forum with leaders of the minority community he chose the low road and took another cheap political shot given his plummeting publicapproval numbers this looks like little more than a desperate attempt to throw a little red meat to his withering rightwing base the governors schedule notes he will take to the airwaves on monday morning on wpro radios john depetro and buddy cianci shows meanwhile several community advocacy groups plan to address the governors actions at a news conference monday carcieri said he decided to take action in the face of federal inaction on immigration reform inaction he said has led to an epidemic flow of illegal immigrants leaving taxpayers to bear the consequential costs carcieri spokesman jeff neal said carcieri took action because many of the current bills aimed at illegal immigration were introduced but failed to pass the general assembly last year and as a result it is not clear that these bills will be approved this year carcieri reviewed similar policies including executive orders in a number of different jurisdictions including tennessee south carolina georgia idaho montana missouri arizona florida oregon and oklahoma neal said he consulted ice and other governors carcieri said thursday he was aware that the topic of illegal immigration stirs great emotion and is a very sensitive issue at several points he blamed the media for ratcheting up the rhetoric yesterday critics said the shoe was on the other foot hes the one thats inflaming the debate said ali noorani executive director of the massachusetts immigrant refugee advocacy coalition which partners with rhode island advocacy organizations the governor has scapegoated the immigration population for political gain and along the way has undermined the safety of each and every resident of rhode island noorani said if you look or sound like an immigrant theres no reason to ever trust rhode island state troopers noorani added once a victim does not feel safe reporting a crime the criminal wins thats the net result of the executive order that the governor signed many people called talkradio shows yesterday to praise carcieri including buddy tassoni of johnston tassoni is a member of rhode islanders for immigration law enforcement a group opposed to illegal immigration and amnesty for undocumented immigrants i applaud the governor for having the backbone that our congressional delegates dont have tassoni said he added this is a nation of immigrants as the governor stated and we certainly welcome all that will comply with our immigration laws he said he also called his congressional leaders to tell them the governor had to do something because they dropped the ball riile president terry gorman said he was extremely pleased with the governors action i think its long overdue and i think this tremendous reaction from this opposite side of the issue is because theyre very nervous about the magnitude of this situation being exposed carcieris actions were being noted outside rhode island bob dane spokesman for the conservative national group federation for american immigration reform said carcieri will be in good company he called the 287 g program that gives state police immigration powers a kind of forcemultiplier its a good program its not cops working as immigration officers as much as its cops working more closely with the immigration officers dane added so much of the immigration fight is moving from inside the beltway here in washington to cities and states across the country the local communities in the states are doing the work the federal government isnt doing and wont do angela kelley director of the immigration policy center a research arm of the american immigration law foundation said that federal action not executive orders by governors is the way to go i think an executive order is a good way to do business if youre trying to send a message but its not a terribly effective way to solve the problem said kelley the majority of local initiatives try to send a tough message of cracking down on folks perhaps naïvely hoping theyll leave i do think its naïve were not talking about an insignificant number of people there are 12 million undocumented people 7 to 8 million of them are workers and we have 3 to 5 million us citizen kids where one or more parents are undocumented thats why i think its about sending a message said kelley i dont think anyone really believes theyre going to go kzinerprojocom4012777375 promo web your

479 of 997 documents the minnesota lawyer minneapolis mn march 17 2008 immigration lawyers group in minnesota seeks to educate and advocate byline michelle lore section news length 1134 words with the immigration debate continuing to rage on both locally and nationally one minnesota lawyers group is doing its part to educate the profession and the public on issues affecting immigrants in early may the minnesotadakotas chapter of the american immigration lawyers association will hold a twoday regional conference in eagan that will include topics of interest not only to immigration attorneys but also to lawyers in a host of other practice areas impacted by the immigrants minneapolis immigration attorney david wilson chair of the local aila chapter explained that particularly in the current climate of heavy enforcement immigration issues are beginning to pervade many areas of the law including family law employment law and even corporate and business law a simple question of whether someone was hired properly can mushroom into a much bigger problem for a company wilson told minnesota lawyer so were trying to reach out to the broader legal community with our conference to educate them on those issues in the beginning the national group got its start back in 1946 according to minneapolis immigration attorney sam myers who served as president of aila from 199192 it was initially formed as a way for immigration attorneys to share information but the groups purpose and strategic goals as well as its membership have grown exponentially over the years it now boasts more than 12000 members consisting of attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law the national group seeks to provide a voice for immigrants representing them in the political arena said wilson it is also vocal in providing information about proposed changes in immigration law to members of congress and to the executive branch when its forming regulations he added the minnesotadakotas chapter is one of 36 aila chapters located throughout the country it was created in the late 1970s largely through the effort of retired minneapolis immigration attorney jerome ingber myers worked with ingber to get the local group going he recalled that at least three attorneys were needed to start a chapter and thats exactly what they had he added that at the time there were only six immigration lawyers in the state ingber served as the first chair of the group the local chapter has since grown to more than 200 members with much of that growth occurring in the past five years wilson attributes much of the recent growth to the fact that immigration issues have begun to dominate national and even local politics the mission of local aila chapters is fundamentally the same as that of the national association the local chapters implement the strategies decided by the national group said myers in that sense they are the backbone of the association correcting information education of the public attorneys and even the government comprises a large portion of the local chapters work there is so much demonizing of immigration that goes on and so much of it is based on just absolute incorrect information said wilson as an example wilson said that hed recently heard the governor of pennsylvania point to h1b visas as the reason philadelphia teenagers dont have computerprogrammer jobs h1b visas allow us employers to employ foreign guest workers in specialty occupations there is just no correlation between the two said wilson its a failure of education not a failure of immigration so when politicians make grandiose statements like that we at least try to offer a logical educated and specific response in an effort to educate local attorneys on specific immigration issues the chapter holds one or two continuing legal education seminars each month on a range of topics relevant to many practice areas wilson stressed that many issues come up today that are far beyond just whether a client is in the country legally individuals who practice employment law or do corporate representation have become really interested in the overlap with immigration he explained but immigration issues are also coming up for criminal attorneys and family law attorneys they have an interest in knowing a little more about immigration law so they can advise their clients a little more competently while the monthly seminars are a way for members to gain information and get together the primary method they use to keep in touch is a listserv there they exchange and discuss cases coming out of various immigration agencies and courts all over the country immigration law is practiced on a nationwide basis even though we may be based here we try to stay in tune to what is going on nationally and work with each other to communicate trends said wilson myers echoed that sentiment chapter members spend a lot of time talking with each other he said i dont go a day without receiving five or six emails from chapter members dealing with dysfunction aila and its local chapters face a variety of challenges in todays climate of heavy immigration enforcement and proposed reform according to wilson one of those challenges is dealing with the recent change in rhetoric relating to immigration the country has shifted from a healthy discussion of comprehensive immigration reform and what that may look like to a general antiimmigrant sentiment he said also difficult is dealing with increased federal enforcement of immigration policies the federal government is becoming very aggressive in how its going after individuals whether its a person who crossed the border illegally or whether its the employer wilson said he noted that in the last 18 months minnesota jumped from two immigration and customs enforcement agents to more than 30 finally members contend that dealing with the failings of immigration agencies themselves is keeping them busy myers referred to the immigration system as dysfunctional there are backlogs long waiting lines and processing delays the agency is far more inaccessible now wilson agreed with immigration services you have an agency that will gladly take your money but wont provide the benefit in a timely manner he said if this was a consumer transaction they would have been sued several times over for consumer rights issues the upcoming regional conference will address these and many other immigration related issues local and national speakers will discuss things like i9 compliance ice enforcement tactics conflicts of interest corporate immigration policies and criminal liability for employers and workers to be frank if i was a corporate attorney and my job was to oversee hr somewhere this type of program is exactly the type of program id want and thats what were trying to offer said wilson loaddate march 18 2008 language english documenttype general news publicationtype newspaper copyright

172 of 997 documents the forward february 28 2014 immigration comes home to cantor section news pg 1 length 1179 words the organized jewish community is known for its impressive bipartisan clout when advocating issues relating to israel but when it comes to domestic affairs the community suffers from a lopsided lack of leverage on the republican side some jewish activists believe that they may have found a pathway to the gop side of the aisle their tactic play the jewish card on the sole jewish republican in congress house majority leader eric cantor in a communal event held in cantors hometown of richmond va on february 16 a group of pro immigration jewish activists including past donors to cantors campaigns tried to send the no 2 republican in the house a message that immigration reform shelved by his own party is a jewish issue he ought to be taking on it was a strategic choice said abby levine director of the jewish social justice roundtable which organized the event we strategically chose richmond because of the importance of eric cantor cantor could be a key person for immigration reform house speaker john boehner made clear that the issue is off the table for this legislative year and cantor who has avoided expressing his views on the details of the senate bipartisan immigration bill is viewed by some including those of the jewish community that largely supports reform as the only senior republican open to change on the issue but past experience has shown that cantor despite his close ties with jewish leadership has not been receptive to the communitys domestic agenda gathered at the richmond jewish community center on a snowy sunday afternoon some 70 members of the citys jewish community listened to immigration stories that recalled to the audience the role immigration played in american jewish history the presentation stressed immigration reform as an issue in line with core jewish values jay ipson wearing a cowboy hat decorated with a menorah symbol spoke of his family immigration from lithuania after the holocaust and of the tragedy of closing immigration gates during the war janet slipow meyers whose parents came from russia in the early 20th century told her story and roben farzad a successful bloomberg writer who came with his family from iran after the islamic revolution represented the younger generation of jewish immigrants to america joining them was felipe marroquin a nonjewish resident of richmond marroquin burst into tears while sharing with the audience the story of his wife of 20 years who was deported to guatemala while not discussing the issue directly at the event organizers have highlighted in their publications another richmond jewish immigration story that of the family of the citys most politically powerful son cantor his grandparents fled antisemitism in russia to arrive in america and start a new life in virginias capital i am the grandson of immigrants and as such my life has been blessed with both the strong religious faith and hardworking entrepreneurial ethic that so many immigrants bring to america cantor wrote in the 2010 book young guns a new generation of conservative leaders which he cowrote with fellow republican reps paul ryan and kevin mccarthy organizers said cantor was invited to attend the event but did not respond as the discussion drew to a close participants were offered a letter to sign it was to be sent to cantor urging him to meet with his local jewish constituents to discuss immigration the immigration stories presented at the event have inspired us to consider the richmond jewish communitys unique connection to the issue of immigration the letter said the 36 participants joining the letter asked their congressman to meet with a group of richmond jewish leaders to discuss how the issue affects our community and how we can support you to fix the broken immigration system the request comes after previous attempts by jewish immigration activists to meet with cantor were turned down gary creditor who is the rabbi of richmonds temple bethel and is a member of the grassroots group virginia organizing has been unsuccessful in his requests to meet personally with cantor and discuss immigration reform creditor vowed to keep on trying to convey the message to the house majority leader explaining that sometimes its like water on a rock and you have to continue working and working at it all the time cantors office did not respond to requests from the forward to comment on the event or on cantors refusal to meet with members of the jewish community in his constituency to discuss immigration reform the drive for reforming americas broken immigration system and for dealing with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants gathered momentum late last year as prominent senators from both parties agreed on a set of reform principles republicans controlling the house of representatives also seemed to express willingness to take on the issue but bitter disputes over including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and pushback from more conservative gop circles led the house leadership to announce that it would not advance immigration legislation this year cantor recently suggested that instead of taking on a major overhaul of the immigration system both parties should try and make progress on the smaller issues they can agree on such as legalizing the status of children of undocumented immigrants who study in college or serve in the military richmonds jewish community with 12000 members and six synagogues is considered small in size but some of the activists who showed up to the immigration event carry weight on the local political scene ipson has contributed to cantors congressional campaigns as has mark sisisky who moderated the meeting both also gave to democratic candidates in the state sisisky whose father was a democratic member of congressfrom the district now representedby cantor said he believed that the jewish story of immigrationis a story eric should take intoaccount when he leads the party but keeping in the spirit ofsouthern hospitality sisisky alsomade clear that we didnt comethere to slam eric cantors relationship with the organized jewish community hasbeen a mixed bag a staunch supporter of israel cantor is countedas a safe vote on legislation relatingto israel and is seen as an ally of theproisrael lobby yet on the domestic front where the jewish community trends liberal and wherecantor holds conservative views especially on fiscal matters cooperation has been rare levine expressed her hope that theimmigration issue will have moreresonance with the republicanleader i dont know what driveshis decisionmaking process buthe

happening a new focus crystal williams deputy director for programs at the american immigration lawyers association in washington said the complexity is causing many immigration attorneys to focus their practices in a particular type of immigration law that is something that has always been around to some extent but we are seeing more concentration on one part such as just physicians or just on hightech visas or just on asylum or removal work williams said were seeing a vast increase in that having to do with the information overload its just easier to keep up with one thing rather than the

502 of 997 documents the washington post october 24 2007 wednesday suburban edition poll finds immigration on voters minds issue rapidly rises to prominence with threefourths calling it important in election byline anita kumar and jon cohen washington post staff writers section metro pg b07 length 1441 words after years of simmering in the background illegal immigration has quickly emerged as one of the key issues in virginias nov 6 election particularly in northern virginia where voters say they are seeking candidates who will address it according to a new washington post poll threequarters of likely voters in virginia said immigration is important to their votes in the election for state and local offices while just a year ago immigration ranked seventh of 10 listed issues in a post poll before the us senate race since then the percentage of virginia voters calling immigration extremely or very important to their vote has jumped 15 points thats heartening said corey a stewart rat large chairman of the prince william board of county supervisors who spearheaded efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants for many people this has really become a serious threat to their quality of life there is a widespread sense that illegal immigration is a local problem particularly after congresss failure to approve an immigration overhaul this summer that has vaulted the issue into prominence it has also gained attention because of what people in both parties say is a predominantly republican tactic to turn attention away from president bushs sagging approval ratings an unpopular war and the states costly new abusivedriver fees its a conscious political strategy by virginia republicans said frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum an immigrant advocacy group in washington what happens in virginia in the legislative races will be a pretty good test of whether this works or not republicans across the state and a few democrats in conservative districts have seized the issue unveiling countless proposals to curb illegal immigration and talking it up on the campaign trail in the past two statewide elections the unsuccessful republican candidates for us senate and governor tried to make immigration an issue but it did not resonate as deeply with voters as such problems as traffic congestion transportation and the states economy are still the biggest issues facing virginia today according to the post poll but immigration has made a surge in voter interest this fall among likely voters 61 percent called illegal immigration a problem where they live a majority of likely voters who said immigration is extremely important would like to see republicans maintain control of the general assembly and those who call the issue the states top problem generally prefer the gop approach but overall virginians give democrats a narrow edge on handling immigration and more voters would like to see the democrats take over the state legislature i think democrats would have a better solution said barbara humphreys 57 of buena vista who ranks immigration as a top issue along with the economy and the war in iraq political analysts say democrats could make gains in the republicanled legislature nov 6 when all 140 house and senate seats are up for grabs democrats could take control of the senate for the first time since 1999 and pick up a halfdozen or so seats in the house of delegates analysts say a majority of virginians 53 percent said they want state and local governments to do a lot to deal with illegal immigration an additional third said they want some action although state and local governments can do little to resolve immigration concerns in part because federal and state laws provide many protections for illegal immigrants six in 10 likely virginia voters said they would be more inclined to support an office seeker who advocated aggressive state and local action against illegal immigrants i think we need to strengthen our borders said lori robinson 45 of norfolk who plans to vote for republicans next month partly because she thinks they would be stronger on immigration im looking for someone to stand up and say this is what this country needs you want to help everyone but you cant clearly theres a lot of frustration with the broken immigration system said tim freilich legal director for the virginia justice center for farm and immigrant workers what were seeing are state and local elected officials trying to do something what we need now is comprehensive immigration reform we dont need meanspirited shortsighted results in recent months prince william and loudoun counties have voted to curtail government services to illegal immigrants and herndon voted to close a controversial daylaborer center frequented by many illegal immigrants last week the prince william board also unanimously passed a proposal that will allow police to check the immigration status of anyone who breaks the law fairfax officials are trying to determine which county services can be denied to illegal immigrants although they havent decided to do that republicans dispute the notion that they are exploiting the immigration issue to gain political advantage saying they are responding to complaints from voters if youre hyping a nonissue you wouldnt get these results stewart said gerald e connolly d who is running for reelection as chairman of the fairfax county board of supervisors said many politicians are making false claims about what they can do some politicians have declared open season on a particular group of immigrants who are here that goes way beyond unpalatable it puts people at risk i can tell you ive spoken to a lot of immigrant communities this has made them very anxious we have a sad history in virginia that we dont want to repeat connolly said nearly seven in 10 virginians polled said the federal government has not done enough to deal with the issue but many also see illegal immigration as a state and local issue and not one that the federal government alone should address about one in eight virginians call immigration the most or secondmost important problem in the state fiftyone percent of those surveyed said illegal immigration is a problem where they live including 20 percent who said it is a very serious problem steve fowler 57 a consultant who lives in manassas describes immigration and transportation as his top issues after abortion to me the issue is whether they broke the law to come here he said but bill maxwell 70 a retiree who has lived in alexandria for four decades said immigration is not a top priority i think republicans are making a big deal out of it said maxwell who has voted for both parties in the past but plans to vote democratic in november on most questions about immigration there are wide differences by party and region although 58 percent of republicans and 55 percent of independents want much more local action on illegal immigration fewer democrats 43 percent do and almost threequarters of republicans are more likely to support a candidate who wants strong action against illegal immigrants nearly double the percentage among democrats republicans would do a better job said pat holub 42 who is in the navy and lives in springfield liberals have a tendency to want to do everything for everybody nearly a third of likely voters who live north of the rappahannock river said immigration was one of the top two issues in the state and 77 percent said illegal immigration was a problem in their communities 37 percent called it a very serious problem those numbers surged higher in prince william where half of all residents called immigration the most or secondmost important issue facing the state and a majority classified illegal immigration as a very serious local problem roy beck executive director of numbersusa a group that advocates limits on immigration and penalties for illegal immigrants called the poll results surprising because immigration has not been an issue taken on by a statewide leader in virginia as it has in some states beck attributed some of the interest to increased attention to immigration by the media and to the enormous alterations in the states landscape people across virginia especially in northern virginia they are witnessing a rapid change he said the poll was conducted by telephone oct 4 through 8 among a random sample of 1144 virginia adults including additional interviews with randomly selected residents of loudoun and prince william counties the results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points it is larger among subgroups polling analyst jennifer

511 of 997 documents albuquerque journal new mexico distributed by mcclatchytribune business news september 5 2007 wednesday when should apd call immigration officials byline tj wilham albuquerque journal nm section state and regional news length 867 words sep 5albuquerque police officer ron olivas has never called federal immigration officers in seven years patrolling the city officer ben baker has called once in his 10year law enforcement career and apd spokesman john walsh has called twice in 22 years but in recent weeks determining when cops should call federal immigration officers has become a hotly debated topic among elected officials community leaders and the public for example albuquerque police issued a policy for its officers and then was forced to reissue it after a flood of complaints over just what it meant republican city councilor brad winter has drafted a resolution clarifying a previous one he voted for in 2001 that declared albuquerque immigrant friendly and the republican party has made thousands of phone calls accusing mayor martin chavez of making albuquerque a haven for criminals and urging people to call city hall meanwhile the us immigration and customs enforcement agency checks the immigration status of all those booked into the west side jail whether albuquerque police calls them or not so whats the point its a very hot issue right now police chief ray schultz said in a recent interview its a very confusing issue the confusion started last month when an apd policy was leaked to the media that said officers shall not inquire about or seek proof of a persons immigration status even if an arrest is made for nonimmigration criminal violation schultz said the policy was issued as the result of a settle ment stemming from a may 2005 lawsuit filed by the mexican american legal defense and educational fund the lawsuit alleged that the police and albuquerque public schools violated the civil rights of three high school students by seizing and detaining them at del norte high school until immigration officials could question them under the settlement apd agreed to develop a policy that was in line with a 2001 resolution that was unanimously passed by the council winter who was council president at the time said the 2001 ordinance was passed to protect witnesses and victims of crime it was not written to protect those arrested as he claims chavez is trying to do with the new policy the intent was never to protect individuals who are in custody for crimes he said schultz said he realized officers didnt understand the new policy after some complained to news reporters that the policy meant they could never check someones immigration status within a few days a reworded policy was distributed that said officers shall not inquire about or seek proof of a persons immigration status unless the person is in custody or is a suspect in a criminal investigation for a nonimmigration criminal violation and the immigration status of the person or suspect is pertinent to the criminal investigation the republican party and winter interpret that to mean officers cant call immigration officials so winter drafted a resolution that would allow officers to call immigration officials whenever they make an arrest republicans have started a campaign targeting chavez in which they urge residents to call the mayor to voice their displeasure but in the end we all agree schultz said our officers can call immigration when they make an arrest under the current policy officers have discretion to call immigration officials when they arrest someone if their immigration status is pertinent to the investigation schultz said for example he said if someone is arrested for stealing a car officers can check the suspects immigration status if they believe the suspect is a flight risk discover the suspect was born outside the us or if the person has no ties to the community officers cant call just because someone is hispanic schultz said we want officers to have an articulate reason to call we dont want them to run them just because of their last name we want the officers to decide when it is appropriate if an officer doesnt know if its appropriate to call ins the officer can always call a supervisor schultz said olivas said most cops dont want a policy that restricts them on a daytoday basis we dont have a clue what we might run into what we have to do and what resource we need he said right now there is a lot of political turmoil over our heads speaking for the cops we just want to have all of the resources available to us to keep the public safe immigration and customs enforcement spokeswoman leticia zamarripa said agents regularly obtain a list from the jail of all those arrested who are foreign born agents check the inmates immigration status and place an immigration hold on anyone in the country illegally those inmates are held until their cases are adjudicated to

residency visas would be available but on monday learned there were none the immigration lawyers said the aboutface by the immigration system had no precedent in at least three decades of legal practice and said that it violated the immigration agencys regulations the american immigration lawyers associations legal action arm was preparing the lawsuit said crystal williams deputy director federal officials said a misunderstanding had arisen from an effort by both agencies to reduce huge backlogs of applications for permanent residence visas known as green cards immigration officials acknowledged that the effort was poorly handled was there a lack of communication between us and the state department said william g wright a spokesman for the immigration agency certainly the episode started on june 12 when the state department announced in a monthly bulletin that green cards would be available starting july 2 for applicants across the range of highskilled categories that was a signal to immigrants who have been working in this country on temporary visas that they would be able to apply to become permanent residents thousands of immigrants rushed to obtain certified documents assemble employer sponsorship papers take medical examinations and dispatch their applications many canceled travel plans so they could be in the united states when their applications arrived on july 2 as the law required but on monday the state department announced that no more green cards were available snared in the turnabout were welleducated highly skilled legal immigrants many of them doctors and medical technicians with long work experience in this country all had obtained federal certification that no american workers were available for the jobs they hold the episode laid bare conflicting interests between the state department which manages the offering of visas and the citizenship and immigration services a branch of the department of homeland security that processes the visa applications by law only about 140000 employmentbased visas are available annually so there are huge backlogs of applications state department officials said their june alert that visas were available was intended to prompt the immigration agency to speed its processing so that no visas would go unused since 2000 a total of 182694 workbased visas have not been given out because the immigration agency had fallen behind in processing applications according to the 2007 report of the immigration agencys ombudsman we were determined that every employment number that was available would be used june kunsman the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for visa services said yesterday immigration agency officials said they were surprised by the departments action they said they immediately advised the department that they had already finished approving enough applications to use 60000 visas of those offered department officials did not revise their public notice offering visas we said we already have more than enough applications and we expect to complete them in time to use the visa numbers said mike aytes director of domestic policy operations at the immigration agency to complete the applications in time the immigration agency put employees to work both days last weekend at service centers in texas and nebraska immigration officials said they said that 25000 applications were processed in the final 48 hours before mondays deadline in some cases security clearances required by the fbi were not entirely completed immigration officials said the agency approved some applications when we were certain the process will be completed very shortly mr aytes said in its bulletin on monday the state department said that unexpected action by the immigration agency had used up all the visas for the 2007 fiscal year the news was crushing to murtuza bahrainwala a 38yearold occupational medicine doctor from india who works at decatur memorial hospital in illinois after nearly 12 years working as a physician on temporary visas dr bahrainwala believed in june that his chance for a green card had finally come apply for citizenship thats absolutely what we want to do he said once he has a green card his wife would also be authorized to work and he could accept promotions and change jobs which he cannot do with a temporary visa but because the application he delivered on monday was not accepted dr bahrainwala may have to wait four or five years to apply again right from complete ecstasy you go down to the depths of depression dr bahrainwala said i have never been illegal a single day in this country maybe i should have just crossed the rio grande he added immigration lawyers said that the situation punished immigrants who were identified as highly desirable by the system and who have always gone by the book theyve played by the rules for years said daryl buffenstein cochairman of the global immigration practice at paul

526 of 997 documents the washington times june 19 2007 tuesday immigration crisis fissures byline by gregory page special to the washington times section commentary a14 length 1197 words the historical parallels between abraham lincolns famous a house divided against itself cannot stand speech and congress protracted inability to pass an enforceable immigration law are compelling when lincoln used his house divided imagery in 1858 he referred to our democracys inability to resolve a great moral and legal issue by eradicating slavery the attempt of two senators from opposite political poles to compromise on immigration sen jon kyl arizona republican and sen ted kennedy massachusetts democrat will show us how much lincolns house divided metaphor accurately mirrors another great moral and domestic security issue of our own time congress unwillingness to either enforce our borders or define american citizenship and residency when individuals cross the border illegally the new kylkennedy immigration bill rests on a classic legislative compromise by 1 identifying and simplifying the primary goals of major legislators and related coalitions and 2 then representing as many of their vital interests in the same bill as possible without defeating or ignoring a given coalitions primary goal like legislative midwives assisting in the perfect compromises attempted birth and delivery messrs kyl and kennedy have adroitly identified and then served the two primary coalitions supporting an enforceable immigration law one coalition views immigration laws as vehicles for vindicating the primacy of both enforceable democratic law and our national or economic security thus the new senate immigration bill would serve these vital interests by requiring employers within 18 months to electronically verify the immigration status of all new employees from a federal database building a 370mile border fence hiring 18500 new border patrol agents ending catch and release enforcement and allocating green cards according to an economic security point system that rewards job skills education and english language proficiency more than family ties by themselves except for foreignborn spouses and minor children a second coalition believes that either humanitarian grounds or desirable rates of economic and related population growth associated with illegal aliens justify easing the penalties and visa prerequisites of existing immigration laws the new senate bill would serve these interests as well by establishing a twoyear guest worker period renewable twice for between 400000 and 600000 individuals working in jobs for which american workers could not be found requiring those renewing their guest worker status to spend one year outside the us and also allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the us while applying for a renewable fouryear visa provided they paid significant civil fines and returned to their home country to file their visa application just days after the kylkennedy senate compromise bill was announced major legislators in both parties spoke as if they opposed not just this particular compromise but achievable legislative compromise itself for example at least 40 senators confirmed almost immediately that they would oppose the bill many without reading its lengthy text house speaker nancy pelosi characterized the economic security point system for green cards as antifamily because it subordinated traditional family unification immigration principles to the economic security goals supported by opposing coalitions likewise rep brian bilbray republican chairman of the congressional immigration caucus criticized the guest worker and fouryear visa programs because any plan that rewards illegal behavior is amnesty even though the new visas would be administered under the same tough border enforcement machinery that his caucus has consistently favored has congress been rendered impotent in immigration because just as in lincolns time it is controlled by large and disparate factions of voters with sectional and economic interests antithetical to democratic compromise undeniably hispanic rights groups like the national council of la raza oppose strict enforcement of immigration laws by arguing the sheer numbers of illegal immigrants and their increasing political power about 40 million illegal aliens will reside in the us in the next 10 years justify disobeying immigration laws declining to enforce them or replacing their prescribed penalties retroactively with eventual american citizenship likewise meatpacking and other corporations such as tyson foods and cargill supported 2006 demonstrations against enforcing immigration laws by closing their plants similarly walmart and the national restaurant association sponsored the 25th anniversary of the national immigration forum last week another organization supporting either suspending or retroactively ignoring existing immigration laws interest groups opposing compromise necessarily support the status quo of not enforcing duly enacted immigration laws sen lindsey graham south carolina republican correctly points out that doing nothing is a national security nightmare and that therefore if you dont have an alternative that will secure our borders and deal with illegal immigration you are not helping the country thus an enforceable legislative compromise would advance the most fundamental principle in immigration law today the sanctity and longevity of democratic law itself by deciding whether a foreign nationals first political act on our soil will be to either flout or follow us law congress simultaneously defines and epitomizes americas civic culture now and in the future in lincolns national house or your own home the inability to define and control invitees is tantamount to abandoning citizenship and ownership itself therefore the degree to which congress either enforces immigration laws or countenances their violation should be decided not by ascertaining if old or new immigration laws would make us wealthier or happier but by the degree to which both the american people and their government decide to be or not to be sovereign the numerous reasons for opposing the kylkennedy or any other enforceable compromise are not nearly as important as a republic healthy enough to rationally delegate critical public policy choices to congress rather than a parochial clique of lawbreakers that perversely set national immigration policy by either surreptitiously hiring illegally or secretly crossing our borders illegally absent a new immigration law that can be honestly and transparently enforced democracys relevance to the immigration crisis will be as fictional as the existing immigration laws that congress duly enacted and then quietly refused to enforce if undemocratic and frequently unseen forces continue setting immigration policy in lieu of congress then both legal and illegal immigrants will enter a previously democratic house no longer standing as a real democracy because of destructive democratic strife and paralysis just as lincoln feared gregory page

528 of 997 documents tulsa world oklahoma june 14 2007 thursday final home edition charges hearing loom for immigrant byline leigh bell world staff writer section news pg a1 length 951 words an undocumented immigrant whom immigration officers nabbed days after he was released on bond from the tulsa jail will face deportation proceedings a spokesman for us immigration and customs enforcement said that will come only after the man javier cortez handles expected charges from an arrest june 2 in tulsa on a complaint of cocaine possession cortezs case revealed several problems in the local enforcement of federal immigration laws when he bonded out of the jail where deputies are supposed to check the immigration status of prisoners he got caught between two different shifts said chief deputy tim albin of the tulsa county sheriffs office thats not an excuse but i suspect thats what happened standing in the stark white jail albin held two different files for cortez one under the last name cortez the other under another last name cortez also lists two different dates of birth this is part of the problem that we unscrew on a daily basis said albin the jail supervisor they will use their mothers last name their uncles last name and 10 different dates of birth sometimes its just a nightmare they do it on purpose because they know they can confuse the system after cortez bonded out immigration officials verified that he is in the united states illegally he was arrested the evening of june 5 at the office of his bailbond agent said tim counts the immigration and customs enforcement spokesman cortez has the right to a hearing in immigration court this is the second time that cortez believed to be 18 or 19 was booked into the tulsa jail he was arrested in october 2006 on a misdemeanor complaint of driving under the influence he was also cited on that stop for transporting an open container and lacking a drivers license or insurance verification immigration officials were not notified of the first arrest counts said albin said the jail didnt then conduct immigration checks on those arrested in misdemeanor cases albin said the jails current policy is to notify immigration officials when the status of someone booked is in question albin said federal officials can place a detainer that prevents a person from bonding out until his or her status of residency is verified jail attendants didnt check cortez immigration status when he was booked early june 3 albin said cortez immigration status should have been checked when cortez listed his place of birth as mexico but it wasnt jailers called federal officials about cortez the day after he bonded out sheriffs deputies now ask for the birthplace of everyone booked into the jail if someone is born outside of the united states or if there are other reasons to question the suspects legality such as an inability to speak english or lack of a drivers license a deputy will ask immigration officials to run a check on the person with the department of homeland securitys law enforcement support center albin said the jails booking system has several points in which a prisoner regardless of race or ethnicity is questioned about immigration status its predominantly a hispanic issue but take a white guy like me he said if i come in the jail and they have questions about my legal status ill go through the same process as anyone else given probable cause of unlawful presence federal officials can order the person detained until his or her immigration status is determined although immigration officials said a hold can be placed in as little as an hour it doesnt always happen so quickly albin said federal officials respond within 12 to 24 hours but someone can bond out of jail in as little as four hours he said if the jail hasnt heard from immigration officials and a prisoner legally posts bond the jail has no right not to release that person albin said unlawful presence in the us is a civil offense not a federal crime the charge is addressed in immigration court an administrative establishment where the gravest punishment is deportation sometimes illegal immigrants bond out before federal officials get them but thats happening less and less albin said federal officials are generally getting back to the jail faster which means more people are being held on detainers he added immigration officials picked up five persons with detainers on tuesday and six more on monday he said leigh bell 5818465 leighbelltulsaworldcom things are changing the tulsa county sheriffs office which operates the tulsa jail is working on an agreement with the federal government to tackle illegal immigration the agreement would provide training for 30 of the offices deputies to conduct immigration status checks instead of asking federal agents to do it chief deputy tim albin said the agreement would allow deputies to more efficiently place a detainer on someone whose immigration status is in question this type of detainer prevents a person from bonding out of jail before the status is determined the training of deputies should start later this year albin said the states sweeping immigration law which takes effect in november classifies arrested illegal immigrants as flight risks which changes bond policies it could double the bond amount or eliminate it altogether albin said were looking for some clarity from the court on that issue he said mayor kathy taylor recently announced that she agreed with the city councils recommendation that the immigration status be checked on all persons booked into the jail for a felony or fullcustody misdemeanor loaddate june 15 2007 language english publicationtype newspaper 
529 of 997 documents the washington post june 11 2007 monday correction appended met 2 edition immigration judges often picked based on gop ties law forbids practice courts being reshaped byline amy goldstein and dan eggen washington post staff writers section asection pg a01 length 1718 words the bush administration increasingly emphasized partisan political ties over expertise in recent years in selecting the judges who decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of immigrants despite laws that preclude such considerations according to an analysis by the washington post at least onethird of the immigration judges appointed by the justice department since 2004 have had republican connections or have been administration insiders and half lacked experience in immigration law justice department immigration court and other records show two newly appointed immigration judges were failed candidates for the us tax court nominated by president bush one fudged his taxes and the other was deemed unqualified to be a tax judge by the nations largest association of lawyers both were republican loyalists justice officials also gave immigration judgeships to a new jersey election law specialist who represented gop candidates a former treasurer of the louisiana republican party a white house domestic policy adviser and a conservative crusader against pornography these appointments all made by the attorney general have begun to reshape a system of courts in which judges ruling alone exercise broad powers deporting each year nearly a quartermillion immigrants who have limited rights to appeal and no right to an attorney the judges do not serve fixed terms department officials say they changed their hiring practices in april but defend their selections still the injection of political considerations into the selection of immigration judges has attracted congressional attention in the wake of controversy over the bush administrations dismissal last year of nine us attorneys the post analysis is the first systematic examination of the people appointed to immigration courts the relationships that led to their selection and the experience they brought to their position the review based on justice records and research into the judges backgrounds encompassed the 37 current judges approved by attorney general alberto r gonzales or his predecessor john d ashcroft starting in 2004 that year is when the justice department began to jettison the civil service process that traditionally guided the selections in favor of political considerations according to sworn congressional testimony by one senior department official and a statement by the lawyer for another official those two officials d kyle sampson and monica m goodling have said they were told the practice was legal but justice spokesman dean boyd said that immigration judges are considered civil service employees who may not be chosen based on political factors unlike judges in federal criminal courts all the judges appointed during this period who arrived with experience in immigration law were prosecutors or held other immigration enforcement jobs that was a reversal of a trend during the clinton administration in which the justice department sought to balance such appointees with ones who had been attorneys representing immigrants according to current and former immigration judges boyd said in a written statement that judges appointed during the bush administration are well qualified for their current positions and that outstanding immigration judges can come from diverse backgrounds boyd also said that race and ethnicity are not factors in hiring but cited statistics showing that immigration courts are considerably more diverse than other kinds of courts the department launched a new hiring program in april that requires public announcements of open positions and detailed evaluations and interviews with a final decision still in the hands of the attorney general the action came partly in response to a lawsuit by a veteran immigration counsel who alleged discrimination when she was passed over for two judgeships some judges and other immigration experts are highly critical of the administrations practice of placing political allies on the courts when we start seeing people who look like theyre fulfilling someones political debt get these positions it starts to become disturbing said crystal williams a deputy director of the american immigration lawyers association immigration law is very complex said denise slavin an immigration judge since 1995 in miami who is president of the national association of immigration judges a union so generally speaking its very good to have someone coming into this area with an immigration background its very difficult for those who dont to catch up mike hethmon general counsel of the immigration reform law institute which advocates stricter border policies said however that a strong legal background is more important than immigration experience the qualities of a good adjudicator dont necessarily focus on the subject matter he said since sept 11 2001 the bush administration has said it is employing the nations 54 immigration courts with 226 judges as a central tool of its antiterrorism policies using them to deport hundreds of noncitizens who were detained as terrorism suspects but were not charged with crimes in 2002 it created stiffer guidelines for appeals and wrote new rules sharply reducing the number of judges who hear them partly to reduce a large case backlog that has made it harder for people deemed unwanted by the government to stay in the country the infusion of politics into the selection of judges began in the midst of this transformation of the court system sampson and goodling who participated in the prosecutor firings did not say which immigration judges had been selected for their political leanings but records and interviews reveal the republican ties of many one was glen l bower whom bush initially nominated to the tax court he was never confirmed because lawmakers noted that his amended tax returns showed he had taken inappropriate deductions for entertainment gifts and meals for three consecutive years a former republican state legislator bower was the revenue director to thenillinois gov george h ryan r who would be convicted on racketeering and fraud charges a few months earlier another failed tax court nominee francis l cramer a former campaign treasurer for sen judd gregg rnh was appointed as an immigration judge cramers bid for a seat on the tax court foundered after the american bar associations taxation section wrote a rare letter to the senate finance committee saying we are unable to conclude that he is qualified to serve cramer was then hired by the justice departments tax division and was briefly lent to the departments office of immigration litigation ashcroft approved him as an immigration judge in march 2004 the government accountability office a legislative watchdog criticized the appointment saying converting a schedule c political appointee with less than 6 months of immigration law experience to an immigration judge position raises questions about the fairness of the conversion another politically connected lawyer garry d malphrus was appointed to arlingtons immigration court in 2005 he had been associate director of the white house domestic policy council and before that a republican aide on two senate judiciary committee subcommittees during the florida recount after the 2000 presidential election that brought bush to office malphrus took part in the brooks brothers riot when gop staffers from washington chanted stop the fraud at miamis polling headquarters other appointed republican loyalists include lawyer dorothy a harbeck who represented new jerseys last gop candidate for governor mark h metcalf an unsuccessful republican candidate for the state senate and us congress from kentucky who went on to several positions at the justice department unrelated to immigration and chris a brisack a former texas county gop chairman who had been named by bush the governor at the time to the states library and archives commission bruce a taylor who was appointed as an immigration judge in arizona last year was general counsel for two conservative antipornography groups citizens for decency through law and the national law center for children and families taylor also worked as a senior counsel in the criminal division at the justice department but his rsum does not indicate immigrationrelated experience like other immigration judges contacted last week taylor declined to comment he said the executive office for immigration review which oversees immigration courts had instructed immigration judges to refer questions to the main office in falls church a spokeswoman there referred questions to justice headquarters the recent pattern of hiring for immigration judges provoked a 2005 lawsuit by the governments chief immigration lawyer in el paso for 22 years guadalupe gonzales no relation to the attorney general alleged she was denied a judgeship twice in favor of lessqualified white men who were hired without an open application process her suit alleged that between 2001 and late 2005 only two latinos were appointed nationwide as immigration judges justice department records make clear that the immigration bench is overwhelmingly male and white even though spanishspeaking people from latin america make up at least 70 percent of the caseload the justice department responded in court papers that gonzaless lawsuit should be thrown out it argued that she had not identified a discriminatory practice and that immigration judges did not have be hired as part of a competitive process it said that all but four immigration judges chosen during the period in contention from late 2003 to 2006 were hired without public competition in september judge emmet g sullivan of the us district court for the district of columbia ruled against the department finding that gonzales had identified a particular policy that has a discriminatory effect on a particular group sullivan said that one judge hired in el paso did not meet the minimum qualifications for the job neither the judge said had gonzaless level of experience

1038 words wealthy philanthropic foundations are helping bankroll the proimmigration movement while groups advocating for tighter control of us borders say they take a more grassroots approach to raising money the ford foundation the carnegie corporation and democratic activist george soros are among the liberal funders that have donated millions of dollars to proimmigration groups as the senate continues its debate on a contentious bill that would overhaul the nations immigration policy three of the nations biggest and most influential proimmigration groups the national immigration forum the mexican american legal defense and educational fund maldef and the national council of la raza nclr collectively received more than 325 million from ford foundation since 2005 the three advocacy groups generally support the proposed senate bill which would give many of the estimated 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the us a path to citizenship the bill also would allow aliens here to bring close family members into the country proimmigration nonprofit groups say theyre hardly awash in cash compared to organizations lobbying on other contentious issues such as abortion the environment and tort reform to me its remarkable how little money goes into immigration reform on both sides of the issue said frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum its lilliputian mr sharry said groups on both sides of the immigration issue can rightfully be considered grassroots outfits we have a staff of only 10 people mr sharry said of his group which supports allowing aliens a path to legal residency or citizenship these groups on all sides of the debate are small intense and highly informed but groups supporting stronger immigration policy and tighter border control say they rely more on small donations from individuals than large foundations numbersusa which says it has 366000 members saw its membership grow 50 percent since jan 1 and 18 percent in may spokeswoman caroline espinosa said twothirds of the groups financial support comes from private people with the average donation being 40 contrary to what might be popular belief is that the grassroots aspect is more on our side than the proimmigration side mrs espinosa said they have more of these organized established types of groups funding them and driving their activism john tanton a retired smalltown michigan ophthalmologist who helped organize federation for american immigration reform fair numbersusa and the center for immigration studies says money alone wont win the immigration debate money can be a help but it also can be a hindrance he said if you dont have to go out and meet the public and get shouted at and get directmail surveys rejected then you wont know about the pulse of the public weve had our share of major supporters but weve had to rely on nickelanddime support mr tanton said a complete list of funders isnt available as these lobby groups are not legally required to report their funding sources but many major philanthropic institutions make at least part of their donor lists public showing a strong proimmigration bias in their donating the open society institute run by mr soros has given 825000 from 2002 to 2004 to the national immigration forum mr soros who donated large sums of money in a failed effort to defeat president bushs bid for reelection in 2004 also has donated 525000 to nclr and 325000 to maldef during the same period the ford foundation with assets of more than 9 billion is known to favor liberal causes the foundation was significantly criticized in 2003 after it gave millions of dollars worth of grants to palestinian nonprofit groups that later were accused of conducting terrorist activities the carnegie corporation has contributed almost 7 million collectively to the national immigration forum maldef and nclr since 1994 nclr also collected almost 22 million from the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation from 2003 to 2005 and 425000 from the rockefeller foundation since 2004 the rockefeller foundation since 2004 also have given more than 1 million to maldef and 300000 to the national immigration law center about onethird of nclrs budget comes from foundations nclr spokeswoman lisa navarrete said noting however that her group cannot use money from taxexempt foundations for political purposes but rather uses it to support its other functions foundation money is used strictly for policy purposes and research work she said we keep a strict line on that less than 2 percent of nclrs budget is used to promote its immigration agenda she added were a latino advocacy group what we do is much broader than just immigration ms navarrete said advocacy groups on the other side of the immigration debate are not without some financial support from philanthropic entities the conservative scaife foundations of pittsburgh gave fair one of the biggest immigrationcontrol nonprofit groups 775000 from 2003 to 2005 the foundations during the same time period also gave 420000 to the center for immigration studies and 100000 to the numbersusa education and research foundation groups also that advocate tighter border control and restricting the flow of immigrants the scaife foundations which include the sarah scaife and carthage foundations are connected with conservative billionaire richard mellon scaife the principal heir to the mellon banking oil and aluminum fortune the fm kirby foundation which has supported many conservative nonprofit groups in recent years gave 475000 to numbersusa since 1998 and donated more than 375000 to fair since 2000 but overall opponents of the bill say they rely more on strength in membership numbers that translates beyond donations noting the more than 750000 faxes opposing the senate bill sent to members of congress last month this just shows how angry people are about this bill and over the idea of amnesty and allowing 12

532 of 997 documents the new york times may 31 2007 thursday late edition final wide disparities found in judging of asylum cases byline by julia preston section section a column 6 national desk pg 1 length 1598 words asylum seekers in the united states face broad disparities in the nations 54 immigration courts with the outcome of cases influenced by things like the location of the court and the sex and professional background of judges a new study has found the study by three law professors analyzes 140000 decisions by immigration judges including those cases from the 15 countries that have produced the most asylum seekers in recent years among them china haiti colombia albania and russia the professors compared for the first time the results of immigration court cases over more than four years finding vast differences in the handling of claims with generally comparable factual circumstances in one of the starker examples cited colombians had an 88 percent chance of winning asylum from one judge in the miami immigration court and a 5 percent chance from another judge in the same court it is very disturbing that these decisions can mean life or death and they seem to a large extent to be the result of a clerks random assignment of a case to a particular judge said an author of the study philip g schrag a professor at georgetown university law center the study offers an unusually detailed window into the overburdened and often erratic immigration courts though the immigration bill now being considered does not propose major revisions in asylum laws those courts serve as the judicial backbone of the immigration system that would take on an immense new workload if the bill becomes law the legislation would offer a road to legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants eliminate backlogs of legal immigration cases and step up enforcement among other measures experts predict countless legal snags that would land before the immigration judges officials at the executive office for immigration review of the department of justice which oversees the immigration courts declined to allow interviews about the study with david l neal the chief immigration judge citing a policy that immigration judges do not speak with the news media about their rulings the study found that someone who has fled china in fear of persecution and asks for asylum in immigration court in orlando fla has an excellent 76 percent chance of success while the same refugee would have a 7 percent chance in atlanta similarly a haitian seeking refuge from political violence is almost twice as likely to succeed in new york as in miami immigration lawyers acknowledge that the judges have difficult work with huge dockets of cases that must be decided speedily on the basis of scant or subjective information often the asylum seeker is the only witness to crucial events but because immigration law is federal the studys authors argued some uniformity could be expected in judges asylum rulings across the country particularly in cases of people fleeing a country like china or colombia where the conditions of political oppression or civil violence are publicly known its such a highvolume system where the participants have so little time to test cases and make decisions you become much more subject to the general viewpoint of the judge said bo cooper a lawyer at paul hastings janofsky walker who is a former general counsel of the immigration and naturalization service that has created a risk mr cooper said that the system will not be good enough at providing refuge to those in need or identifying the claims of those who are not in need the wide discretion exercised by immigration judges can be disheartening to lawyers and disastrous for immigrants facing threats to their lives if they are forced to return home immigration lawyers said oftentimes its just the luck of the draw said cheryl little a lawyer and executive director of the florida immigrant advocacy center a legal assistance group in miami that represents many asylum seekers its heartbreaking ms little said how do you explain to people asking for refuge that even in the united states of america we cant assure them they will receive due process and justice while immigration officers at citizenship and immigration services the federal agency can grant asylum the majority of asylum cases are decided by the immigration judges under the immigration system refugees are foreigners coming from abroad who win residency in the united states for protection from religious persecution or political threats asylum is granted to foreigners who apply for refuge when they are already in the united states the study is based on data on judges decisions from january 2000 through august 2004 it will be posted today on the web site of the social science research network wwwssrncom and published in november in the stanford law review in addition to professor schrag the authors are andrew i schoenholtz also a professor at georgetown university law center and jaya ramjinogales a professor at beasley school of law at temple university according to the study great differences also prevail among judges sitting on the same court and hearing similar asylum cases in the miami immigration court one judge granted 3 percent of the asylum cases while another granted 75 percent one of the most significant factors determining whether a judge would be likely to approve asylum petitions was sex the study found female immigration judges grant asylum at a 44 percent higher rate than their male colleagues the study by the three professors did not examine the judges political affiliation or the administration that appointed them the study suggests that the different willingness to grant asylum between male and female judges may in part have to do with their backgrounds of 78 female judges in the study 27 percent had previously worked for organizations that defended the rights of immigrants or the poor while only 8 percent of 169 male judges had similar experience though the study does not identify judges by name profiles of immigration judges were drawn up separately by the transactional records access clearinghouse a research group at syracuse university they show that the 24 judges who sit today in miami 21 in court and 3 based in a detention facility include some of the most likely and least likely to grant asylum according to the clearinghouse profiles one immigration judge currently on the miami court mahlon f hanson granted 3 percent of the asylum cases he heard he was the secondtoughest judge in the nation on asylum issues the group found judge denise n slavin who hears cases at the krome north detention center in miami granted 59 percent of the asylum claims she considered placing her in the top 15 percent of judges approving such claims lawyers said the variations may in part have to do with the cases particular courts are handling miami immigration courts see a large number of asylum claims from haiti and the judges may have differing outlooks and disagree about the possibilities for haitians to face persecution in their country the variations between courts and among judges were particularly troubling the authors of the study argued because of the impact of procedural changes introduced by the bush administration in 2002 at the board of immigration appeals the appellate body that reviews decisions by the immigration court judges those changes led to a sudden and lasting decline in appeals that were favorable to asylum seekers the study found raising doubts as to whether the board was providing fair appeals in 2002 attorney general john ashcroft made streamlined the work of the appeals board reducing the number ofboard members to 11 from 23 and encouraging more decisions by single members and without explanation the study looked at 76000 decisions by the appeals board from 1998 through 2005 asylum applicants who were represented by lawyers received favorable appeals decisions from the board in 43 percent of cases in 2001 the year before the changes took effect by 2005 asylum seekers with lawyers won their appeals in 13 percent of cases the judges handle a very large caseload theyre human they are not going to catch every detail said mary meg mccarthy director of the national immigrant justice center a legal assistance group in chicago but once they streamlined the board of immigration appeals ms mccarthy said there was a failure of the board to review those cases to check on what the immigration judge had found when that failed we had a real crisis in the system as a result of the trends at the appeals board there has been a new surge of asylum appeals to the federal circuit courts in practice the last resort for immigration cases over all the number of people winning asylum in the united states has declined dropping by about 12 percent from 28684 in 2003 to 25257 in 2005 the last year when complete figures are available the immigration courts have been in the spotlight after justice department officials said last week that the investigation of monica m goodling a former aide to attorney general alberto r gonzales has been expanded to include her role in helping to appoint immigration judges ms goodling testified last week that she had crossed the

535 of 997 documents the augusta chronicle georgia may 18 2007 friday all edition illegal immigration will congress solve it byline by daniel griswold guest columnist section editorial pg a05 length 797 words this week the new democratic congress began debating an immigration reform bill aimed at curbing illegal immigration if democratic leaders can work with president bush and their republican counterparts to enact comprehensive immigration reform one of the most vexing issues facing our country could be solved few people on either side of the immigration debate are happy with the status quo today an estimated 12 million foreignborn people live in the united states without authorization with the number growing by half a million each year those immigrants fill an important growing gap in the us labor market our economy creates hundreds of thousands of jobs each year for lowerskilled workers in such sectors as cleaning food preparation landscaping and retail at the same time the pool of americans who have traditionally filled such jobs continues to shrink as nativeborn workers become on average older and better educated yet our immigration system offers no legal channel for peaceful hardworking if lowskilled workers to enter the country to fill those jobs largescale illegal immigration will end only when americas immigration system offers a legal alternative when given the choice of paying a smuggler 2000 risking robbery and death in the desert and living a shadowy existence in the underground us economy unable to leave and return freely to visit home or entering the united states through a port of entry with legal documents enjoying the full responsibility and protection of the law and the freedom to visit home without fear of being denied reentry the large majority of potential entrants will chose the legal path we know from experience that legal immigration if allowed will crowd out illegal immigration in the 1950s the bracero program allowed mexican workers to enter the country temporarily typically to work on farms in the southwest early in that decade illegal immigration was widespread because the program offered an insufficient number of visas to meet the labor demands of a growing us economy instead of merely redoubling efforts to enforce a flawed law congress dramatically increased the number of visas to accommodate demand the result apprehensions of illegal entrants at the border dropped by more than 95 percent if the goal is to curb illegal immigration any temporary worker program must offer a sufficient number of visas to meet the legitimate demands of a growing us labor market the fact that 400000 to 500000 foreignborn workers join the us labor force illegally each year indicates the general magnitude of how much demand exceeds the supply of available legal workers a temporary worker program should offer at least that number of visas to allow the revealed demand of american employers to be met legally to be effective an expanded visa program must also be flexible enough to respond to labormarket signals union leaders are pressuring democrats to require that temporary workers be paid prevailing wages that is artificially high unionlevel wages rather than market wages that would be a recipe for failure since many of the jobs filled by immigrant workers are lowskilled lowwage jobs that would simply not exist in the legal economy if unionlevel wages were mandated adding cumbersome labor rules will only perpetuate the underground labor market that has been created by the current system demands for restrictive wage rules are based on false fears that increased legal immigration will drive down the wages and working conditions for a broad swath of american workers but only a small and declining share of the american workforce competes against immigrant workers according to the new americans the authoritative 1997 national research council study of immigration the only two groups of americans who face downward wage pressure from immigration are other recent immigrants and nativeborn americans without a high school diploma the wage impact on american workers is small the weight of the empirical evidence suggests that the impact of immigration on the wages of competing nativeborn workers is smallpossibly reducing them by only 1 or 2 percent the nrc study concluded more recent studies confirm the small impact of lowskilled immigration on competing american workers if congress fails to reform americas immigration laws in a way that reflects the reality of our market economy the problem of illegal immigration will only grow worse without comprehensive immigration reform congress and the administration will waste billions of dollars more trying to enforce an unenforceable

537 of 997 documents north carolina lawyers weekly may 14 2007 immigrants change nc legal landscape byline guy loranger section news length 1609 words the states growing immigrant population especially residents from mexico and latin america is rapidly changing the legal landscape for the states attorneys and not just those who specialize in immigration and naturalization law in recent years the federal government has aggressively pushed enforcement of its immigration measures including the start of us immigration and customs enforcement ice programs in three north carolina counties the emphasis on enforcement has not only spiked the volume of cases being handled by the states immigration lawyers but also has shown how frequently immigration issues branch out into areas such as criminal family and employment law no matter what area of concentration its inevitable that more attorneys will be confronted by immigration matters in the coming years charlotte lawyer alan gordon said this makes it critical that attorneys be aware of the intricacies of the countrys system of immigration and naturalization laws and develop an awareness of the wider social issues that surround them ive always been passionate about education and thats one of our goals to get more information out to the public the press and the bar said gordon who has practiced immigration law for 30 years and chaired the recently released mayors immigration commission study in charlotte we need to get more information out about the complex interaction of legal and illegal immigration in this country it affects people in the united states and thus it affects lawyers in the united states booming population north carolina boasts the eighth highest population of illegal immigrants in the country with an estimated 300000 according to the pew hispanic center a nonpartisan research organization based in washington dc the state also had the fastestgrowing hispanic population in the country during the last decade thus when the department of homeland security created its ice program in 2003 acting under section 287g of the 1996 illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act north carolina was a prime location for it to take root the program allows ice to enter agreements with state and local law enforcement officers in which local officers are trained to identify arrest detain and begin the removal process for undocumented immigrants whom they encounter in the course of their regular law enforcement activities the mecklenburg county sheriffs department was the first in the state to enter the program ice programs in gaston and alamance counties have since followed theyre basically ice agents gordon said and they have access to ice databases where they can check for immigration violations the program appears to be meeting its goals within 10 months after ice began in mecklenburg county the sheriffs department booked 3000 immigrant residents and started deportation proceedings against 1530 according to media reports it also has put a strain on charlottearea immigration law attorneys more people are being arrested said cynthia a aziz who has practiced immigration law for 18 years in charlotte so our volume of cases has stepped up dramatically hans christian linnartz a durham attorney who teaches legal writing and immigration law at dukes law school said the ice programs could lead to targeting of immigrants especially hispanics most officers wont abuse this power but some will routinely detaining anyone who doesnt speak english and cant produce a green card proof of us citizenship or evidence of valid nonimmigrant status linnartz said the complexities of immigration law will insure that many who are perfectly legal will be detained until they can prove so to local law enforcement or to ice the spanishspeaking community will suffer many extra detentions both of actually illegal aliens and also us citizens and other people in lawful status there is an added concern linnartz said that the programs will make the immigrant community nervous about reporting crimes to local law enforcement inevitably criminals will soon target this group of residents as easy victims linnartz said pointing to robberies and bogus documentation scams on the black market unreported crimes against them will skyrocket branching out the role of the attorney is more important than ever in making sure clients understand their rights when immigration issues arise aziz said for instance since immigration violations are civil and not criminal there is no right to appointed counsel or miranda warnings no exclusionary rule against the use of illegal evidence in immigration proceedings no right to immediate release on bond and in many cases no right to appear before an immigration court before removal from the country according to linnartz by policy ice often accords suspected illegal immigrants more rights than the law requires and we can be thankful for those small mercies he said but someone attempting to defend against deportation is in a far worse position than a person attempting to defend criminal charges this means criminal defense attorneys must be aware that accepting a guilty plea in a criminal matter could in some cases start their clients deportation its critical that lawyers have a thorough knowledge of the immigration laws and not just dabble in it aziz said deportation in some cases can lead to a mandatory 10year bar on entering the country which can have tragic impacts on families and raise custody issues gordon said he said that he frequently is approached by employers after they have learned that a key worker or supervisor is out of status these people are important for their business good people hard workers with children or spouses who are us citizens gordon said but we have to explain to them that the law is that they are barred from being here if they are not legal big picture winstonsalem attorney sean lew who will become the nc bar associations immigration law committee chair in july said he has noticed an increased interest in this area of law among members of the bar we have many nonimmigration lawyers who come into our meetings he said theres a lot of overlap gordon said that north carolinas approach to immigration law has made it one of the countrys leaders including its requirement that lawyers seeking to become certified specialists in the field must pass a test gordon who helped design the test played a part in establishing the north carolinasouth carolina chapter of the american immigration lawyers association it all goes to improving the expertise of lawyers who are practicing in a very complex area he said in chairing the comprehensive 80page mayors immigration commission study gordon wanted to provide attorneys with knowledge about more than substantive law and procedure he wanted them to get the bigger picture by seeing how the states immigrant population affects education health care and other areas with such information he said attorneys should be able to understand the need for reform of the nations patchwork system of immigration laws reform that has become the focus of an intense national debate i think the north carolina legal community is very concerned and compassionate and theyre very committed to righting the wrongs and fixing the systems that are broken gordon said i hear it every day from attorneys who are practicing in other areas of the law and they know its time to talk to senators and congressmen and get immigration reform thats equitable and fair and reflects the american values of hard work and honor immigration court to open in charlotte the opening of the states first federal immigration court in charlotte later this year promises to make resolutions swifter and life easier for immigration attorneys and their clients the executive office for immigration review eoir announced plans to establish the court in march charlotte was among three cities selected for courts because of growing immigration caseloads joining omaha neb and kansas city mo there are 54 immigration courts nationwide including atlanta where north carolina cases are handled what really drove it was the volume of cases said cynthia a aziz a charlotte attorney who has practiced in the atlanta court since 1989 it has increased dramatically through the years among states without an immigration court north carolina has ranked among the top three in the country since 2003 in the number of cases involving its residents in fact the majority of cases in the atlanta court have come from north carolina we have criteria that we use and the numbers increase in the charlotte area had made it one of the top one or two potential sites for the last three years said susan eastwood a public affairs specialist for eoir it should be a significant benefit to the area eastwood said that a building had not yet been chosen for the court which will have one judge and a support staff it will operate under federal jurisdiction and handle common immigration cases including removal and asylum hearings alan gordon a charlotte attorney who chaired the mayors immigration commission study that recommended an immigration court for charlotte said that the atlanta court had become overburdened and understaffed in

the issue this has caused a record number of bills to be introduced in this years general assembly session immigration advocates estimate that about 50 proposals were offered this year lawmakers seeking to toughen state laws contend the measures are needed to fill a void caused by the inaction of federal officials one thing is very clear virginia state legislators are frustrated with congress failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform said tim freilich legal director of the virginia justice center for farm and immigrant workers who called 40 of the measures negative bills cover among other topics education law enforcement the workplace restricting public benefits and combating human trafficking at a news conference this month some house republicans cited their frustrations with the white house as a republican i am deeply disappointed in the leadership on the issue by president bush said del john s reid rhenrico who has introduced about a halfdozen measures that would crack down on illegal immigration i agree with him on many issues but on this one i am disappointed reids bills include one preventing virginia companies from firing legal workers without cause if businesses knowingly employ illegal immigrants and one prohibiting illegal immigrants from paying instate tuition at public colleges and universities people are contacting their legislators because they do not like the idea that people are coming over here illegally with impunity reid said in an interview last week this is a federal issue and the federal government should deal with it but in their absence of dealing with it the state and localities should those who favor tougher immigration laws contend its a fairness issue and that its unfair to those immigrants who followed the rules we cannot turn the cheek of indifference to the flagrant violation of our immigration laws republican lt gov bill bolling said at the news conference many of the bills seeking to toughen immigration laws come from northern virginia republicans whose region contains some of the highest numbers of foreignborn residents in previous years similar proposals have cleared the more conservative house and died in the more moderate senate one virginian in 10 was born outside the country between 250000 and 300000 illegal immigrants live in virginia studies show most of whom are hispanic immigration reform is expected to come before the democratcontrolled congress which analysts believe is more open to immigration changes than the previous gop leadership bush addressed the need for immigration reform during his state of the union address last week which drew applause from congressional democrats during a news conference last week immigration advocates called many of the proposed virginia bills harmful signaling out proposals they say would hurt children and businesses a bill that would have required school officials to examine immigration documents of children born outside the united states was later tabled in the house education committee many of the bills concern law enforcement such as those giving state and local officials the ability to enforce federal immigration laws advocates say that would have a chilling effect on immigrant communities and their relationship with police this month republican attorney general bob mcdonnell urged democratic gov timothy m kaine to let some state agencies among them the virginia state police enter into an agreement with us immigration and customs enforcement to give them those powers in the investigation of certain violent crimes kaine has declined saying he didnt want virginia taxpayers picking up the bill for a federal responsibility and that it could undermine current agreements with the federal immigration agency a bill to require that the state enter into such an agreement is pending if legislators want to address immigration reform said the rev c douglas smith executive director of the virginia interfaith center for public policy they should do that through the federal delegation proposed changes immigrationrelated bills before the general assembly would give state andor local police the authority to enforce

center poll finds that most americans wont be focusing on immigration come nov 7 just 24 percent of voters name immigration as a key election issue compared with 51 percent who cite iraq and 37 percent who cite terrorism according to the poll it matters a great deal to a small minority of voters but it is not a toptier issue for a majority of voters said pews associate director carroll doherty with the scandal surrounding former rep mark foley dominating the national political discussion it remains to be seen what impact immigration or for that matter any other issue will have on voters poll of voters but the pew poll released late last week suggests that the foley scandal has not significantly affected voters views democrats according to the telephone survey of 1804 adults maintained a slight advantage over republicans both before and after the former florida congressman resigned in the wake of disclosed sexual emails between himself and teenage pages concern about immigration was higher among republicans 32 percent of whom identified it as a top voting issue compared with 12 percent of democrats the poll also noted doherty said that those who favor a tough approach to immigration are much more motivated than people on the other side of the issue fully 33 percent of those who back strong border protection and stiffer penalties say immigration is important to their vote that compares with just 11 percent of those who support a comprehensive approach to immigration policy the poll found tough platforms the numbers havent stopped candidates in battleground states from arizona to pennsylvania to virginia from running on toughonimmigration platforms tamar jacoby a senior fellow at the manhattan institute who advocates legalization for

the absence of a new guestworker program or legalization measures as a victory for her side senate republicans and democrats also failed this year to enact their legislation that would have beefed up border security while also creating a guestworker program as well as granting citizenship to millions of illegal immigrants it seems like what weve mainly been able to accomplish is keeping the status quo she said hvidston said she doesnt believe that the foley scandal will influence votes for those who care about immigration to the person in the voting booth in an area affected by illegal

illegal aliens have turned parts of the southwest desert into environmental disaster areas dumping an estimated 25 million pounds of trash in the arizona desert carving out hundreds of miles of roads through the wilderness and destroying thousands of acres of habitat with cooking fires that have gone awry the desert environment is fairly sensitive so were concerned about the damage to habitat

and backpacks by the thousands not at all once the immigrants both legal and illegal arrive the scenario isnt much rosier immigration is now the primary factor in us population growth which drives such environmental woes as housing sprawl pollution and traffic but dont expect your local green party activist to grab a lawn chair and join the minutemen border patrols any time soon the mainstream environmental movement is firmly and uniformly agnostic on the issue weve never taken a position pro or con on immigration sierra club spokesman eric antebi said we dont have the expertise to deal with that illegal immigration wilderness society spokesman ben beach said these responses exasperate environmentalists such as dick lamm the former democratic governor of colorado and a 30year member of the sierra club mr lamm broke ranks with the movement years ago by insisting that a responsible environmental policy has to include population and immigration controls he is among the most prominent of a smallbuthardy band of environmentalists who have tried for years to push the movement toward an antiimmigration stance so far they havent had much luck the environmental movement refuses to acknowledge that immigration and population are environmental issues mr lamm said why politics he said the environmental movement has gone politically correct mr lamm said theyre committing political malpractice by ignoring population but jenny neeley southwest representative for defenders of life said her group hasnt taken a stance on immigration reform in congress because i dont think were knowledgeable enough to say this will stop the illegal crossingstfi faced with a difficult choice critics said the environmental movement has abandoned its primary mission protecting the planet rather than deviate from the liberal establishment theyre still pretty much ignoring it illegal immigration because its politically sensitive or because they perceive it to be politically sensitive said ira mehlman spokesman for the federation for immigration reform nobody denies that environmental degradation is due in part to population growth and nobody denies that the biggest reason for population growth is immigration but somehow when they put together a and b it doesnt lead to c he said alienating illegals some environmentalists counter that population control is an issue that doesnt respect borders whether the estimated 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the united states chose to live in new mexico or mexico city they are still part of a global overpopulation problem do people who migrate to the united states increase environmental stress it depends on where they would end up otherwise los angeles for example could handle 10000 ecuadoreans more easily than the galapagos islands could sierra club executive director carl pope wrote in a 2004 article in the groups magazine alan kuper a longtime sierra club member and a critic of its immigration stance said this is an unfair comparison because americans are greater consumers of resources than people living in other countries thats the copout argument that you get mr kuper said an individual in the us is responsible for consumption or use of resources of about 30 times the resources a child in india will use in his lifetime critics also cite the groups longstanding policy that calls first for us population control then global stabilization our immigration policy cant make a dent in world poverty and we take in two times more immigrants as any other country already mr lamm said the question is how can the us best help the environment by building a sustainable society other environmentalists acknowledge that they tread lightly when it comes to illegal immigration in order to protect their work on other environmental issues because its such a charged issue in this country its hard to get involved without getting caught in the crossfire mr antebi said we have a history of working with a large number of constituencies and we want to continue to work with them if wed gotten involved with the immigration issue we would have burned a lot of bridges he said the group would have burned those bridges not just with its allies but with many of its grassroots members we tend to work with communities that have a lot of immigrants mr antebi said in california the places with the worst air pollution tend to be the places with the largest number of immigrants if we took sides on immigration pro or con it would affect our relationships with these communities he said no environmental group has debated the immigration issue more publicly than the sierra club in 2004 and 2005 antiimmigration candidates attempted to reverse the clubs direction by running for seats on its 15member board of directors all of them lost including mr lamm in 2004 the club came under fire in 2004 after a wealthy donor wall street investor david gelbaum told the los angeles times that he had warned mr pope in 1994 or 1995 that he would never give another dollar if the club ever took an anti immigration stance in 1996 the club voted to adopt a neutrality stance on immigration reversing its longstanding position in favor of limiting immigration in 2000 and 2001 mr gelbaum donated a total of 100 million to the organization critics accused the sierra club of selling out but mr antebi denied any linkage between the events this organization is too big and too democratic in its grassroots leadership he said pointing out that the clubs policies are set by its elected board no one person can wield that much influence besides he said sierra club members hardly need to be bribed to recognize the merits of avoiding the immigration debate its not that crazy to figure out why an organization like the sierra club would not want to wade into an issue like immigration mr antebi said protecting anwr arctic national wildlife refuge thats our breadandbutter reducing airpollution levels thats our breadandbutter immigration thats really not our breadandbutter remembering zpg at one time however stabilizing the us population was indeed a central tenet of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s when it was just taking root the call for zero population growth was as loud and insistent as the cry for cleaner air and water in 1970 the sierra club adopted a policy calling for the nation to bring about the stabilization of the population first of the united states and then of the world three years later mr pope told the new york times that we cant hope to absorb all who want to come in immigration is a sentimental symbol whose day is long past by 1998 however the environmental movement was in full retreat from both the population and immigration issue roy beck and leon kolankiewicz of numbersusa attribute the phenomenon to a number of factors including the drop in us fertility rates however the researchers from the immigrationreform group conclude that the primary cause was demographics the immigrants were hispanic and there were millions of them environmental leaders soon decided they couldnt afford a political skirmish with a large and increasingly influential minority group one of the main reasons the sierra club leadership gave in 1998 for avoiding the immigration issue was that they dared not risk appearing to be racially insensitive the authors wrote in their paper the environmental movements retreat from advocating us population stabilization 19701998 the authors quote mr pope in a 1997 online message to members while it is theoretically possible to have a nonracial debate about immigration it is not practically possible for an open organization like the sierra club to do so recent history has caused me to change my view of whether it is possible for the sierra club to deal with the immigration issue in a way which would not implicate us in ethnic or racial polarization while that calculation might be correct critics say theres just one problem it puts environmental protection second the result has been the birth of a hybrid political movement made up of environmentalistscumimmigration hawks among the leaders of the movement is mr kuper a onetime sierra club leader and retired physics professor after the 1996 neutrality vote mr kuper founded sierrans for us population stabilization a splinter group of disgruntled members devoted to returning the club to its traditional population policy the group developed a scorecard that grades members of congress on their votes on the environment immigration and familyplanning issues mr kuper also regularly lobbies the league of conservation voters to include immigration on its list of issues relations between the rebels and the mother ship arent always cordial during the 2004 and 2005 board elections the antiimmigration candidates accused sierra club staffers of playing the race card to undermine their campaigns after the 2004 election mr pope wrote an essay titled the virus of hate which warned members against a possible infiltration of the club by racists he said that some candidates on the losing side had entered into an ugly alliance with individuals and groups whose motivations are clearly racist mr kuper now includes a disclaimer on his web site denouncing racism under the heading no to racism yes to environmentalism battle at the border one issue that could pull the environmental community back into the immigration debate is the degradation at the border the bureau of land management estimates that only 1 percent of the 25 million tons of garbage left in the southern arizona desert has been hauled off since 2002 the hardesthit areas include the cabeza prieta national wildlife refuge which now includes about 200 miles of illegal roads carved into the landscape by trucks and offroad vehicles prompting the wilderness society to issue an alert the trash problem is staggering to say the least said defenders of lifes miss neeley whose group has been active in cleanup efforts if youve seen it its almost surreal the groups solution however isnt likely to warm the hearts of immigration hawks instead of calling for a clampdown on illegal immigration both groups have stern words for the us border patrol calling on the agency to make a stronger commitment to environmental protection miss neeley said in a 2006 article in an environmental groups publication that the problem lies with the agencys decision to push illegal aliens from urban points of entry such as nogales ariz to the desert the idea was to make crossing the border more difficult but the result has been the degradation of protected lands she said in the sky island alliances newsletter the border patrol also needs to drive on established roads and avoid carving new ones through the wilderness environmentalists say the groups also are uniformly opposed to a border wall or fence which they say would cut off wildlife migration routes what about the actual bordercrossers who rarely stick to the main highway of course thats being done by crossers too but we cant tell crossers hey youre breaking these lawstfi miss neeley said the blametheborder patrol response exasperates agency spokesman gus soto who suggests that the illegal aliens drug smugglers and human smugglers bear greater responsibility for the damage than its officers unfortunately they do choose to point the finger at us but you have to remember were not the ones out there crossing were not the ones out there creating roads were trying to stop the smuggling industry mr soto said the agency has implemented a training program for its officers in environmental awareness officers often patrol sensitive areas via aircraft or on horseback and they feed their horses only with seeds that are indigenous to the region we dont go offroad mr soto said before we do anything we have to do an environmentalimpact study to make sure it wont have a negative impact we dont want to leave an environmental footprint in these sensitive areas the smugglers on the other hand will cross anywhere without concern for the environment he said its the smugglers that are doing this not the border patrol were going after the people who are causing the environmental harm they have their differences but one thing both the border patrol and defenders of wildlife do agree on is that something must be done to reduce the total number of bordercrossers and thats a start if we dont start reducing the total number of crossers the problem is only going to get worse miss neeley said and so far the environmental community really hasnt had an adequate response loaddate october 2 2006 language english graphic jettisoned trash accumulates near ajo ariz

558 of 997 documents the new york times september 9 2006 saturday late edition final boston tests system connecting fingerprints to records of immigration violations byline by eric lipton section section a column 1 national desk pg 11 length 814 words dateline washington sept 8 immigration officials will automatically be notified any time the local or state police do a federal fingerprint check on a suspect who also happens to be wanted for serious immigration violations under a new system being tested in boston the automated notification is part of a department of homeland security program that could expand the role that the local and state police nationwide play in the immigration enforcement effort to federal officials it is a natural next step as police forces have hundreds of thousands of officers who routinely come into contact with illegal immigrants while immigration and customs enforcement has a squad of only about 6000 criminal investigators we are giving more information to more people who can act on the information said robert a mocny acting director of usvisit the department of homeland security program coordinating the effort it only makes sense but some immigration and civil liberties advocates objected once the police become viewed as immigration agents as opposed to simply safety and law enforcement patrols they will lose the cooperation and trust of a significant portion of the communities they serve said marshall fitz director of advocacy at the american immigration lawyers association that ultimately undermines all of our security interest barry steinhardt director of the technology and liberty program at the american civil liberties union said he was also concerned the homeland security departments records rely upon just two fingerprints instead of 10 and are therefore more subject to error mr steinhardt said which could result in someones being wrongly detained on immigration charges it is an unreliable system being run by a barely competent agency mr steinhardt said the new program has started in a relatively modest way when the boston police department runs a fingerprint check of federal criminal records for crime suspects it will also check a homeland security department database of 420000 people who have violated immigration laws the federal list includes people who have been previously deported from the united states or tried to enter but were denied visas if the police happen to stop one of those people both the boston police department and immigration and customs enforcement a division of the homeland security department will be notified the department may then ask the boston police to hold the person for up to 48 hours until the federal authorities can take him into custody or otherwise begin deportation proceedings an immigration and customs enforcement spokesman said eventually as more cities and states participate the homeland security department intends to add nine million sets of fingerprints to the database to include people with less serious immigration records like someone caught trying to cross the border from mexico who then voluntarily returned home mr mocny said the local and state police in many cities including boston already routinely contact immigration and customs enforcement to see if suspects they have detained might also be wanted on federal immigration violations federal criminal databases already include some people wanted on felony immigration violations but the immigrationrelated inquiries have previously been based on names and dates of birth which may be forged and the checks are not frequently done for every arrest and fingerprint check as is now the case in boston you cant hide from the fingerprint mr mocny said mr fitz of the immigration lawyers group said he had no objection if the fingerprints were checked for immigration violations only after an individual had been charged with another crime his concern he said is that the local police might begin to submit such requests routinely during traffic stops or patrols simply to determine if someone was in the united states legally william m casey deputy superintendent of the boston police said boston did not plan to take such a step we are doing nothing differently than we were doing before last sunday mr casey said we are enforcing the laws the boston police always enforce mr mocny said the homeland security department was already moving to a 10fingerprint system to address the potential for fingerprint mismatches he added that he understood that this new program might provoke debate it is also unclear how much demand it will place on the federal immigration enforcement authorities in detaining illegal immigrants and conducting deportation proceedings that is why the project is being tested in boston before being expanded nationally over the next two years eventually mr mocny said it will be all violators of all immigration laws but we are going to give this 22 months to cook to make sure that we are getting it right url httpwwwnytimescom loaddate september 9 2006 language english publicationtype newspaper

length 843 words president bush made immigration reform his main domestic issue when he gave a live primetime address in may touting his vision for increased security and enforcement while calling for some sort of earned legalization for the millions of otherwise lawabiding individuals who live and work in the us without authorization the house and senate have both passed immigration reform bills on dec 16 2005 reps charles bass and jeb bradley voted in favor of hr 4437 the straightforwardly titled border protection antiterrorism and illegal immigration control act of 2005 the bill focuses entirely on border security and enforcement measures creating an unworkable system that criminalizes the more than 12 million undocumented persons currently in the us in contrast on may 25 the senate passed s 2611 the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 that bill seeks to establish a much more balanced approach to immigration and has the support of the white house sen judd gregg voted in favor of the bill while sen john e sununu was opposed given the wide chasm between the two bills house and senate negotiators were to have spent the summer in conference seeking to bridge the gaps through communication and compromise the electorate expected good faith negotiations to result in meaningful reform in whats become a recurring theme the electorate has been disappointed instead of addressing immigration reform head on the house has embarked upon a road show a charade which will likely postpone any vote on immigration reform until well after the november elections lest anyone question whether the hearings are oriented towards promoting a particular antiimmigration reform agenda bear in mind that the aug 1 hearing in san diego was entitled how does illegal immigration impact american taxpayers and will the reidkennedy amnesty worsen the blow house judiciary committee chairman rep james sensenbrenner opened the san diego hearing by explaining that the purpose of the days discussion was to discern the impact that illegal immigration has on the pocketbooks of americans on the taxes that we all have to pay and the benefits that the government can afford to give us rep sensenbrenner then added that the committee would also examine whether the senate bills mass amnesty will cost us even more in light of the hearing name and the chairmans comments its fair to ask whether the hearings seek to treat this issue in a fair and balanced way or simply foment an usvsthem mentality these hearings stem from coldly calculated tactics designed to create the appearance of engagement in the democratic process while doing nothing more than trying to solidify the entrenched opinions of the immigration obstructionist wing of the republican party one of these sham hearings is coming to town at 10 am on aug 24 the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration border security and claims will hold just such a hearing in concord with the republican hold on the house in clear jeopardy a number of stalwarts continue to milk the bases breadandbutter issues terrorism homosexuals and immigration not only with an eye on the general election but also in many cases to survive strong primary challenges from more moderate opponents the hearings thus far have been marked by handpicked audiences opposed to immigration reform to the exclusion of opposing viewpoints rather than engage in an honest open discussion about this countrys longbroken immigration system republican house leadership is putting on a show to keep the issue alive long enough to get a few more angry voters to the polls while the speakers list for the aug 24 hearing has not yet been made public inquiries from immigration reform advocates to participate in the hearing have been soundly rebuffed

have city police certified as immigration enforcement agents despite claims from opponents to his illegal immigration relief act that immigration enforcement is strictly a federal task barletta said he learned about a 1996 amendment to the immigration and nationality act and an immigration enforcement training and certification program offered by the bureau during a trip to washington dc in december the 1996 amendment allows state county and municipal law enforcement and corrections officers to enforce immigration law under certain circumstances on that trip barletta members of his administration and city police officers met with federal law enforcement and immigration officials to discuss strategies for handling hazletons crime problems my first and foremost wish was that the immigration enforcement bureau would locate an office here in hazleton however this is another option that i believe would benefit hazleton i would like to enter into a memorandum of understanding and well pursue the possibility barletta said giving city police officers the ability to process illegal immigrants would be an advantage barletta said given the unlikelihood that the bureau will locate a field office in the city talking with the police chief there are some cities that dont want to get involved in taking the time required in processing those involved in illegal immigration however in hazleton we believe it would speed up the process of having our officers trained and certified to handle the immigration violations under certain circumstances that are allowed barletta said in addition to a memorandum of understanding there are some fairly rigorous requirements for participation said mike gilhooley spokesman for the department of homeland securitys bureau of immigration and customs enforcement he said any police or corrections officers who participate in the program would have to undergo three to five weeks of instruction on immigration law civil rights law and antiprofiling information basically the training is designed to give officers an outstanding understanding of immigration law and protect the civil rights of the people in their custody he said gilhooley said agencies in four counties and three states have memorandums of understanding with his bureau and 158 law enforcement or corrections officers have been certified as immigration enforcement agents the state entities include the florida department of law enforcement the alabama department of public safety and the arizona department of corrections counties with entities include sheriffs departments in los angeles san bernardino and riverside counties in california and mecklenburg county in north carolina gilhooley said the federal government pays the instructors the state county or municipal agency involved pays its employees and provides the facility for the training civil rights attorneys have threatened to sue the city if council passed barlettas relief act ordinance which fines landlords who rent to illegal immigrants punishes businesses that employ them and disallows official communication in languages other than english city council passed the illegal immigration relief act on july 13 and is expected to pass in august a landlordtenant ordinance that would require tenants to obtain occupancy permits to get an occupancy permit they would have to prove residency status or citizenship the attorneys said that the ordinances violate immigration and fair housing laws but the times leader also learned last week that federal immigration attorneys dont believe hazleton code enforcement officers would be violating immigration law by asking for documents that show proof of legal residency or citizenship when issuing occupancy permits our legal department could find nothing in immigration law that would preclude a government agency from requesting such documents if doing so would accomplish something useful within its lawful authority said chris bentley spokesman for the us department of homeland securitys bureau of citizenship and immigration services bentley posed the question to them after a reporter asked if city officials were allowed to require people to show documents that would prove their right to legally reside in the united states or if that power was limited to immigration officials and employers bentley stressed that the bureaus attorneys were not offering a legal opinion and we would never render one in a case like this because its out of their legal purview in the daytoday operations of the bureau but bentley said council requiring code officers to request documents to prove residency status or citizenship for the dispensation of occupancy permits would seem to fit within their lawful authority

senate last week passed legislation that sen edward kennedy dmass hailed as the most farreaching immigration reform in our history you might think that the first question anyone would ask is how much it would actually increase or decrease legal immigration but no after the senate approved the bill by 62 to 36 you could not find the answer in the news columns of the washington post new york times or wall street journal yet the estimates do exist and are fairly startling by rough projections the senate bill would double the legal immigration that would occur during the next two decades from about 20 million under present law to about 40 million one job of journalism is to inform the public what our political leaders are doing in this case we failed the senate bills sponsors didnt publicize its full impact on legal immigration and we didnt fill the void its safe to say that few americans know what the bill would do because no one has told them indeed i suspect that many senators who voted for the legislation dont have a clue as to the potential overall increase in immigration it is interesting to contrast these immigration projections with a recent opinion survey done by the pew research center the poll asked whether the present level of legal immigration should be changed the response 40 percent favored a decrease 37 would hold it steady and 17 percent wanted an increase there seems to be scant support for a doubling if the large immigration projections had been in the news would the senate have done what it did possibly though i doubt it but if it had senators would have had to defend what they were doing as sound public policy thats the real point they would have had to debate whether such high levels of immigration are good or bad for the country what arguments would they have used no one can contend that the united states needs expanded immigration to prevent the population from shrinking our population is aging but not shrinking with present immigration policies the census bureau projects a us population of 420 million in 2050 up from 296 million in 2005 another dubious argument is that much higher immigration would dramatically improve economic growth from 2007 to 2016 the senate bill might increase the economys growth rate by a tiny 01 percentage point annually estimates the congressional budget office the doubling of legal immigration under the senate bill that i cited at the outset comes from a previously unreported estimate made by white house economists because the president praised the senate bill the administration implicitly favors a big immigration expansion the white house estimate could be low robert rector of the conservative heritage foundation has a higher figure the cbo has a projection that the white house describes as close to its own but all the forecasts envision huge increases our immigration laws involve a bewildering array of categories by which people can get a green card the right to stay permanently the senate bill dramatically expands many of these categories and creates a large new one guest workers the term is really a misnomer because most guest workers would receive an automatic right to apply for a green card and remain the senate bill authorizes 200000 guest workers annually plus their spouses and minor children one obvious question is why most of the news media missed the larger immigration story on may 15 republican sen jeff sessions of alabama held a news conference with heritages rector to announce their immigration projections and the estimated impact on the federal budget most national media didnt report the news conference the next day cbo released its budget and immigration estimates these too were largely unreported rectors explanation is that the

immigrants and the guest worker program increases in other immigration categories were largely ignored reporters also cover legislative stories as sports contests whos winning whos losing rather than delve into dreary matters of substance but note the irony the white houses projected increases of legal immigration 20 million are about twice the level of existing illegal immigrants estimated between 10 million and 12 million yet coverage overlooks the former here i think rector has a point whether or not the bias is liberal groupthink is a powerful force in journalism immigration is

byline by aref assaf special to the herald news wire services section forum pg b01 length 1182 words as congress struggles with the issue of illegal immigration a reasonable assessment of the underling influences shaping conflicting views on this national concern is warranted all antiimmigration activists are now wrapping their antiimmigrant agenda in the flag ever mindful of sept 11 and the fact that most immigrants are from nonwhite european countries the national debate on immigration is now framed in the language of fear patriotism and national security fears about immigrant terrorists after sept 11 combined with rising concerns about economic security after the end of the 90s boom have diminished the nearterm prospects for a liberal immigration reform agenda rather than talk about new policies that support broad legalization amnesty and family reunification immigration restrictions have moved to the center of the public debate the antiimmigrant forces are right in their contention that immigration legal and illegal is an issue that needs the urgent attention of policymakers however by scapegoating immigrants for so many of the countrys ills environmental degradation low wages tax burdens crime social disintegration and even terrorist threats the new wave of restrictionists are building a vicious backlash movement thats deepening the social economic and political divides in the nation stereotypes hinder understanding of the intensifying immigration debate the debate divides sharply into two sides on one side stand those who believe that immigration flows should be dramatically restricted commonly described as being antiimmigrant these groups object to the negative label saying that they oppose uncontrolled immigration not immigrants themselves on the other side are those who believe that immigration should be regulated but at levels that reflect the reality of both emigration pressures outside the country and labor needs within it in contrast to those arguing for a clamp down on immigration flows these forces routinely point to the economic and cultural benefits resulting from the immigrant community while also noting that the united states has always been a nation of immigrants those advocating reduced immigration flows can fairly be described as being immigration restrictionists like most other policy reformers the immigration restrictionists have three main bases of operation policy institutes and think tanks in washington dc local citizen movements and organizations and a loose team of pundits politicians and polemicists dedicated to influencing public opinion although immigration restrictionists share a common agenda they do not operate as a unified political bloc antiimmigration forces include partisans of the two main political parties as well as adherents of parties and movements on the political left and right that fall outside mainstream political thinking as antiimmigration sentiment rises the voices advocating a liberal immigration policy confront new challenges more daunting are challenges facing proimmigration groups and immigrant advocates as they seek to establish a framework for discussing immigration if immigrant advocates and immigrants themselves are to move from the sidelines to the center of the intensifying immigration debate and by doing so help staunch the growing influence of the retrograde restrictionist forces they must meet five major challenges the first challenge is to gain credibility as advocates for an immigration policy that considers the totality of us national interests not just the needs and problems of immigrants or the demands of business for new foreign sources of cheap and skilled labor a second closely related challenge is helping us citizens realize that their communities are communities that include a wide variety of immigrants and that this mix is a healthy one the third challenge is overcoming a hesitation to describe the immigration problem as a class problem corporate proimmigration positions often coincide with those of immigrants and immigrant advocates but failing to distinguish between immigration reform motivated by a desire for cheap labor and immigration reform advocated to attain a just society make the entire proimmigration movement extremely vulnerable to the critique that it is an open borders lobby the fourth challenge is one faced by more than just immigrant advocates it is the challenge of integrating legitimate concerns and demands into a new agenda for national economic development if proimmigration advocates are to stem the rising forces of antiimmigrant backlash that are sweeping the united states and gaining momentum throughout the world they must ally themselves with other policy reformers who are beginning to make the case that development must be redefined to mean full employment livable wages an organized work force a highly educated society and environmental protection and restoration the fifth challenge is connecting the dots between immigration policy and foreign policy in their advocacy and education antiimmigrant forces do not hesitate to describe the immigration problem as an international one painting a picture of the united states beset by a nonstop invasion of the worlds poor fleeing war corrupt governments and the lack of opportunity at home the simplicity of their recommended solutions walling the united states in and deporting all those without residency papers appeals to those who believe that to retain the present standard of life this country should be less connected to the rest of the world creating a fortress america those who oppose the fear and hate politics coursing through the immigration debate cannot deny the reality that the united states still represents the land of opportunity for people of an increasing number of countries but also true is that most of the wouldbe emigrants would prefer to live and work in their home countries if economic and social conditions improved there is no existing or proposed immigration policy that will work unless it works in conjunction with a foreign policy based on good neighbor principles and a deep appreciation of interconnectedness at the same time the burden of addressing the immigration crisis whether in the united states or any other receiving nation is first the responsibility of the sending nations yes nations such as mexico should criticize abusive treatment of their nationals but such complaints ring hollow if they are not backed by national development policies that aim to keep their own citizens at home rather than policies that directly or indirectly contribute to their expulsion from their homes longer and higher border walls amnesty guest worker programs and proposed earned citizenship programs are all temporary fixes immigration policy and border control strategies that ignore the power of the forces of supply and demand while

575 of 997 documents herald news passaic county nj april 26 2006 wednesday all editions when jailed females are mixed with criminals many facilities lack separate cellblocks byline by samantha henry herald news north jersey media group section news pg a01 length 978 words when sharon nyantekyi a rutgers university honors student was taken into custody last month for a civil immigration violation she had no criminal history never as much as high school detention yet she was shackled taken to the middlesex county adult correction center and placed among the general female inmate population were not criminals and we were mixed in with criminals said nyantekyi speaking of herself and other female immigration detainees she met in jail to be just thrown in there was like being thrown to the wolves nyantekyis experiences during her 21 days of detention opened a window into a little known aspect of the detention system into which many immigration detainees are cast that female detainees are routinely held among the general inmate population at several new jersey facilities few women have spoken in public about the conditions of their detention since most are deported straightaway from the facilities if this was happening in another country to us citizens the us would be leading the pack to call it a human rights violation nyantekyi said the federal government increasingly relies on subcontracted facilities like county jails to house immigration detainees the number of detainees has gone from just over 9000 in 1996 when immigration laws were changed requiring the government to hold immigrants in custody prior to deportation to more than 21000 in detention today nationwide more than half of all immigration detainees in the country are now held in non immigration facilities like county jails with the government renting space at perdetainee day rates that add up to millions of dollars a year in local revenues but not all local jails that accept immigration detainees have the space to keep them segregated from criminal inmates there is nothing in the department of homeland security guidelines that requires them to do so even though those held on immigration law violations are legally considered administrative not criminal detainees although new jersey county jails generally keep male immigration detainees segregated from their general inmate population several jails said they sometimes house female detainees with the general female inmate population in our jail as in any correctional environment there are generally more males than females so theres a much smaller space allotment to house females said ben feldman a spokesman for the bergen county sheriffs department which oversees the bergen county jail as a result of that theres a need to house those two groups of females ins and general inmate females together at passaic county jail the number of immigration detainees reached nearly 500 before passaic county sheriff jerry speziale suspended the agreement in december 2005 prompted by protests from detainees and advocates over their treatment and a federal government investigation into conditions at the jail bill maer the sheriffs spokesman said the last immigration detainee was transferred out of the jail on april 4 when the jail used to house them he said male immigration detainees were segregated from the general inmate population but female immigration detainees were sometimes housed with criminal female us marshal inmates he emphasized that immigration detainees were not mixed with the general female inmates at the middlesex county adult correction center where nyantekyi was held among criminal inmates until being transferred into protective custody after her safety was threatened warden edward cicchi acknowledged in an interview last week that the jail sometimes mixed female immigration detainees in with the general population when we have females we dont have a separate spot to put them so theyre in with the general population he said but he added that they try not to mix them unless they are short on space as a rule we try to keep them separate he said the housing of female administrative immigration detainees like nyantekyi among female criminal inmates at new jersey county jails is ultimately up to each facilitys discretion as long as they conform with department of homeland security guidelines however the guidelines regarding the housing and treatment of immigration detainees hold no legal weight immigration advocates and those whove been through detention like nyantekyi say that unenforceable guidelines can lead to arbitrary decisions on treatment the basic problem with the guidelines is that they are just guidelines and are not incorporated into the contracts that ice takes out with the jails said bryan lonegan a lawyer with the new york based legal aid society who works with immigration detainees throughout new jersey if were going to detain people and these are people in violation of civil laws not criminal laws they should be detained in different kinds of facilities lonegan said ice guidelines focus on classifying detainees according to their law enforcement history and the potential threat they may pose rather than segregating them along administrative versus criminal classification lines according to ice spokesman mike gilhooly we require that facilities where we place detainees meet the standards regarding classification he said we require that detainees be held with other general population people with the same classification but nyantekyi 23 who had no criminal history and was facing deportation because she was brought to this country from ghana as a child by a relative with false papers said she wasnt the only noncriminal detainee mixed in with other female criminal inmates what happened to me is not the exception its the rule she said right now at this moment in middlesex or bergen there are women

deseret news length 868 words salt lake city jose gonzalez went to great lengths to defraud some 20 people who sought his help to obtain legal immigration status gonzalez told people unauthorized to live in the united states that he could move their immigration cases through the process more quickly for a fee to lend credibility to his story gonzalez passed himself off as a us immigration and customs enforcement officer for more than a year by dressing the part carrying a fake badge and occasionally asking clients to drop him off at the ice office in murray to give the impression he worked there over a year and half gonzalez defrauded his victims of 87000 and their property through the efforts of the utah attorney generals office and the us attorneys office gonzalez was charged with 36 federal counts of wire fraud inducing illegal aliens to live in the united states unlawfully aiding and abetting and impersonating a federal officer in november he was sentenced to 41 months in prison under a plea agreement once he completes his sentence he will be deported one of his victims miguel angel garcia was defrauded of 8000 garcia sought gonzalezs help after a mutual acquaintance told him hes a really good guy thats what got me involved he said in an interview wednesday garcia said many of the things gonzalez promised seemed too good to be true now you just dont want to trust anybody he said law enforcement and immigration officials say gonzalezs case is a textbook example of the profound vulnerability of many people who seek help with immigration issues when people are victims of unscrupulous advisers they are afraid to seek help this is a problem in utah its happening here and its happening nationwide said jeanne kent field office director for us citizenship and immigration services on wednesday federal officials launched an education campaign intended to help people make informed choices in seeking legal advice and representation on immigration matters and to crack down on the unlicensed practice of law the wrong help can hurt campaign intends to help people identify common immigration scams and to direct people to licensed attorneys or nonattorney representatives accredited by the board of immigration appeals both are authorized to provide legal services and represent clients in court said us attorney for utah david barlow kent said scammers use a number of tools to defraud people seeking assistance with immigration matters theyre so clever they make websites that look very much like ours she said some scammers also attempt to sell immigration forms to clients forms the agency provides for free while some forms require a filing fee there is no charge for the documents us citizenship and immigration services will even mail them to people who request them kent said federal authorities have become aware of a scam in california in which the outgoing caller id appears to be from us citizenship and immigration services kent said callers tell applicants there are problems with their immigration documents such as they have not paid all filing fees and they could be deported unless they immediately wire money to the government us citizenship and immigration services does not telephone applicants or threaten deportation of people attempting to seek legal status kent said the agency also does not conduct business in peoples homes or elsewhere in the community we never ask for money over the phone we never ask for a persons identity over the phone she said but many immigrants seeking legal status are vulnerable to scammers because they are reluctant to notify authorities for fear they will be deported assistant us attorney john huber said prosecutors want to catch predators not ensnare people who have already been victimized what motivates a prosecutor is when you have a vulnerable community with predators amongst them taking advantage of them huber said community activist tony yapias said gonzalezs victims initially contacted him yapias reached out to the utah attorney generals secure strike force but wanted assurances that the people gonzalez had taken advantage of would not be subject to deportation actions the strike force set up sting and arrested gonzalez his case was prosecuted by federal authorities all 20 victims were in court the day gonzalez was sentenced barlow said the crime victims were offered u visas which is nonimmigrant status for victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement and government officials in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity according to the uscis website for their help in convicting gonzalez barlow said wednesdays meeting was a jumping off point for a larger community effort to help inform people about available licensed or authorized legal assistance federal and state officials plan to work with community organizations that serve immigrants to warn them of fraudulent practices and direct them to legitimate resources and law enforcement agencies that will assist them if they have been defrauded email marjoriedeseretnewscom loaddate january 23 2014 language english

he heard he would be running against a strident antiillegal immigration candidate parker seeking the republican nomination for state house district 33 in west valley city knows illegal immigration is a hotbutton issue with delegates but hed rather focus on what he sees as more important issues such as education and economic development parker said he disagrees with antiillegal immigration activist alex segura however a new public opinion poll suggests that most utahns would support a candidate who wants to get tough on immigration some 68 percent of utahns said they would vote for a candidate whose platform includes immigration measures such as repealing a law allowing some undocumented students to pay instate tuition according to a deseret morning newsksltv statewide poll of 627 adults the survey was conducted march 2730 by dan jones associates as the us senate debated several immigration reform proposals and as hundreds of students in utah and thousands across the country walked out of class in protest the poll has a margin of error of 4 percent archie archuleta chairman of the utah coalition of la raza said this election season has the potential to be disastrous for immigrant rights archuleta said he hopes that sensible im migration reform by congress can curb what he sees as growing antiimmigrant sentiment this election year is going to be a real test of where were headed as this antiimmigration wave is getting stronger archuleta said the trend of the nation has been to the right on immigration issues while the issue has nationally been a divisive one for republicans the poll suggested that in utah democrats are more divided on the issue than republicans among those who said they were democrats 26 percent said they would definitely vote for gettough candidates compared to 16 percent who said they would definitely vote against such candidates the split among republicans was 44 percent to 5 percent those who said they are very conservative were the most likely to say theyd definitely vote for a gettough immigration candidate the results arent that surprising since they illustrate the nature of utahs republican party which tends to reflect the partys conservative branch nationally said kelly patterson director of the center for the study of elections and democracy at brigham young university however utahs lawmakers are closely split on the immigration issue in the last days of the recent legislative session representatives voted 3534 to keep the house from debating hb7 which would have repealed the tuition law i think immigration is still one of those issues that people are still trying to figure out politically what it means and what to do patterson said you have a conservative part of a party that really knows what it wants to do and a moderate wing of the party thats not quite sure yet rep glenn donnelson rnorth ogden who is running for reelection sponsored hb7 and other failed bills aimed at clamping down on illegal

immigrants are being handled the bia also has been under fire from federal appeals courts across the country for shoddy decisionmaking prompting a number of federal judges to call for changes advocates of the legislation say shifting all cases to one appeals court would provide more consistent rulings on immigration issues they also say it would prevent immigration lawyers from forum shopping to get more favorable decisions from courts such as the 9th circuit viewed as more liberal on immigration rights but the legislation also includes provisions that even critics say would improve immigration justice for instance it beefs up review in specialized immigration courts by expanding the bia from its current 11 members to at least 15 and possibly 23 members that was the size of the board before it was slashed by former attorney general john ashcroft in 2002 and the legislation would make it tougher for the board to decide cases without issuing an explanation a custom that has prompted critics to say board members are rubberstamping deportation orders an aide to specter said friday that the combination of improving the bia and centralizing immigration rulings in one appeals court would relieve the crushing immigration caseload for courts such as the 9th circuit the aide who asked not be identified downplayed concerns about the federal circuit adding immigration appeals to its docket he said the bill calls for the court to add three judges and a team of immigration lawyers the federal appeals courts handled about 10000 immigration appeals last year more than

desk pg 11 length 884 words dateline washington march 24 a littlenoticed provision in two key senate immigration bills would reshape the handling of immigration appeals cases and has touched off an outcry from several legal scholars federal judges and the policymaking group for the federal courts the measure would designate the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit here an administrative court that focuses primarily on patent cases and currently handles no immigration appeals as the only court in the nation to handle immigration appeals such appeals are currently shared by the 12 other federal appellate courts the judges and scholars say that the circuit court in washington which handles about 1500 nonimmigration cases a year would be swamped by an additional 12000 immigration cases and they say that the court lacks the expertise to handle complex immigration cases which often raise a host of constitutional and humanrights issues the question of how these cases are handled is particularly sensitive because federal appeals judges have sharply criticized what they have described as a pattern of biased and incoherent decisions from immigration judges in asylum cases which make up the bulk of immigration appeals the two bills one by senator arlen specter republican of pennsylvania and chairman of the senate judiciary committee the other by senator bill frist republican of tennessee and the majority leader were intended in part to ease the burden on the nations federal appeals courts which have had a sharp increase in immigration cases the provisions may come up for a vote in the senate as early as next week judiciary committee staff members said that designating a single court to handle the cases would ensure a consistent standard for immigration decisions and discourage immigrants from shopping for favorable courts they said that immigration lawyers would also be assigned to the court to help enhance expertise and that the number of judges would be increased to 15 from 12 youre trying to avoid forum shopping and trying to create a uniform national policy for immigration said a senior aide to mr specter who spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the legislation were still being negotiated but richard a posner a prominent federal appeals judge in chicago said the measures were not a sound solution even with the three additional judges judge posner said the annual caseload would surge to 900 per judge from 125 i cannot think of an area of law that is more remote from immigration than patents the judge wrote to senator richard j durbin an illinois democrat on the judiciary committee no doubt the judges of the federal circuit can become knowledgeable about immigration law but they will be overwhelmed by the new caseload leonidas ralph mecham secretary for the judicial conference of the united states a group of judges who make policy for the federal courts and who present the judiciarys views to congress raised similar concerns no sufficient justification to support changing the status quo and shifting these cases from the regional courts to the federal circuit has been provided mr mecham wrote to mr specter the judges also raised concerns about a proposal that would appoint a single judge to decide whether immigration cases were worthy of consideration for appeal if the judge declined the case no further review would be available mr durbin said he planned to offer an amendment that would kill the measures telling his colleagues on the judiciary committee that it would be premature to make such changes before holding hearings but the senior aide to mr specter strongly defended the measure noting that the federal circuit would have fewer cases than many of the federal appeals circuits even with the additional workload he also pointed out that most of the federal circuits judges were generalists not specialists before they were appointed the surge in immigration appeals occurred after attorney general john ashcroft made changes in 2002 to streamline appellate review within the immigration courts many appellate judges say those changes essentially shifted work to them immigration cases accounted for about 17 percent of all federal appeals cases last year up from 3 percent in 2001 in new york and california nearly 40 percent of federal appeals involved immigration critics of the new legislation say that shifting appeals to washington is misdirected and that a better solution would be to add resources to the overstrapped local immigration courts and to an interimlevel immigration appeals court known as the board of immigration appeals they said proposed increases in financing were inadequate leaving immigration judges overburdened and threatening immigrants rights to federal review congress needs to address the virtual collapse of the immigration judge and appeals system not deny immigrants a chance to have their day in federal court said lucas guttentag director of the american civil liberties unions immigrant rights project the american intellectual property law association which represents 16000 lawyers also objects to the change

as the senate starts debating immigration legislation this week missing will be one of the most important elements for any meaningful immigration reform thats the need to cut legal immigration in fact the bill before the senate judiciary committee goes the wrong direction it would blow the lid off some legal immigrant visas almost doubling the permanent resident visas allotted yearly and giving out thousands more temporary visas not only would the senate bill bring in markedly more foreigners through supposed legal routes it would amnesty the 10 million to 12 million illegal aliens already in this country this profligate approach is a recipe for disaster why is the senate going the wrong direction as compared with the us houses enforcementfirst approach do we need higher legal immigration as elitists suggest 1 legal immigration and illegal immigration are two sides of the same coin high legal immigration means high illegal immigration when weve had lower legal immigration weve experienced less illegal immigration the foreignborn share of the us population has risen sharply over the last 40 years so has the illegal alien component of the foreignborn population illegal aliens made up 21 percent of the foreignborn in 1980 a quarter in 2000 and 28 percent in 2005 half of the top 10 source countries are also top illegal alien senders these include el salvador china the dominican republic and the philippines 2 mexico is the biggest source of both legal and illegal immigrants thirty percent of the foreignborn are mexicans and more than half of usresident mexicans are illegal aliens mexicans make up 3 times the proportion of the next three sending countries combined china philippines india mexicans will clearly benefit the most from much higher immigration and from another amnesty leading to more of the same immigration troubles down the line in spades 3 amnesties have exacerbated our immigration problems in many ways this one will be no different the illegal population replenished itself in less than a decade following the 1986 amnesty the number of illegal alien residents doubled from 1990 to 2000 from 35 million to 7 million by 2005 about 10 million illegal aliens lived in the united states more than triple the number of irca amnesty recipients triple the illegal alien population in 1980 and twice the level of illegal immigration in 1996 the several mass amnesties over the last two decades severely mask the degree of illegal immigration the 1986 irca amnesty legalized 3 million aliens threefourths were mexican amnestees gained full eligibility to sponsor additional immigrants which swelled the ranks of both legal and illegal immigrants in fact many new immigrants who receive a permanent resident visa each year have lived in america illegally for years the new immigrant survey found immediate family immigrants who first came unlawfully typically made 2 to 4 trips illegally they lived here 5 to 8 years before legalization 4 the ability to have anchor babies and the phenomenon of chain migration provide more lawbreaking opportunities the senate legislation ignores these critical flaws an estimated onetenth of us births 380000 in 2002 are to illegal aliens birthright citizenship of their americanborn child allows illegals a firmer foothold here an overly generous legal immigration preference system gives visas to grown children and their inlaws aunts uncles and cousins and visa lotto winners ahead of nuclear family members of legal permanent residents and regardless of individuals ability to contribute to americas national interest this antifamily policy keeps parents and minor children husbands and wives apart longer it gives an incentive for illegal immigration such chain migration creates an entitlement mentality by bestowing technical visa eligibility on millions of distant relatives and puts immigration an autopilot 5 the new immigrant survey confirmed the inextricable link between legal and illegal immigration it found twothirds of adult immigrants had spent time in this country before receiving a permanent visa a third illegally for mexicans surveyed 57 percent had illegally crossed the border and 9 percent overstayed an expired visa instead of increasing legal immigration and thereby exacerbating illegal immigration congress should cut legal immigration levels by half or more this would reduce illegal immigration too if history serves as guide we already allot more than a million immigrant visas a year this is 4 times higher than traditional levels from 1776 to 1965 this nation of immigrants averaged 230000 immigrants annually and nearly 50 million foreign workers immigrants and their children already live here we cant possibly need the volume the senate would

viewpoints on immigration reform both hardliners who wanted a crackdown and some hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as antihispanic during the 2011 session legislators introduced the florida immigration enforcement act as hb 7089 and a similar bill in the senate sb 2040 the bills were not identical to arizonas law but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling some businessbacked groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers the house bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a person subject of a criminal investigation if the police had reasonable suspicion the person was in the country illegally also employers would be required to check workers immigration status the senate counterpart didnt go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate not a person only under investigation and it gave some wiggle room to employers in march 2011 the house judiciary committee passed the bill 126 lópezcantera miamidades delegation chair wasnt a member of that committee but in his press release after the vote he spoke positively about the law but didnt specifically state how he would vote on it chairman snyder and the judiciary committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense florida immigration reform this legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for floridians through the use of the everify system the bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops it does however give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the united states i look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process activists opposing the bills turned up the heat and particularly targeted lópezcantera and sen anitere flores a sponsor of the senate bill and another hispanic republican from miamidade in april leftleaning and hispanic groups announced they would launch spanishlanguage radio ads calling out the two legislators groups also held a protest in front of lópezcanteras office while the attacks were going on the herald reported that lópezcantera was now against the house measure and planned to vote against it as well florida doesnt need an immigration law he said in april 2011 the senate passed a version of the bill but the full house never took a vote the measure was dead by the end of the session we asked for evidence from the miamidade group that made the claim but didnt hear back however joshua karp spokesman for the florida democratic party said there was a period of time when lópezcantera supported the bill but later flipflopped we were unsuccessful at getting a direct response from lópezcantera a spokesman for the republican party of florida sent us a statement arguing that floridas proposed bill was different from the arizona law and repeated this line from lópezcanteras press release the bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops our ruling the democratic hispanic caucus of floridas miamidade chapter that stated lópezcantera staunchly supported a bill modeled after arizonas immigration law lópezcantera never had to take a vote on the bill so the only evidence we can evaluate is his statements about the bill at first lópezcantera said he looked forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process thats a positive statement but hardly staunch support but as protesters turned up the heat on lópezcantera he became decidedly opposed saying florida doesnt need an immigration law we rate this claim mostly

being litigated at the circuit level and many immigration lawyers may be illprepared for the challenges the percentage of cases being appealed from the intermediate board of immigration appeals to the circuits has shot up from 5 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2004 the spike which has occurred in all types of immigration cases but especially deportation and asylum matters is largely the consequence of policies designed to streamline the bia that were first implemented in 2002 the changes eliminated a case backlog but many immigration attorneys contend that the quality of review has deteriorated and they are left with no choice but to take cases up to the federal circuits what weve seen is a general rubberstamping of immigration judges if you want an appellate court to hear your case chances are you have to appeal to the circuit said greg siskind an immigration attorney in memphis tenn the deluge of cases is taking its toll on lawyers courts and clients immigration attorneys admit that many practitioners are not accustomed to the rigorous appellate process the american immigration law foundation has seen a growing demand for their workshops which are designed to help immigration attorneys improve their litigation skills many lawyers are anxious about going into federal appeals court despite years in immigration court its a different world said beth werlin litigation clearinghouse attorney for the foundation for lawyers who are used to a volumepractice in immigration court arguing before a circuit court can be a huge change said david leopold an immigration attorney in cleveland its also a dicey proposition for their clients who have to wait longer and pay more to appeal their cases another rung the surge in appeals is creating a messy backlog for the courts some federal appellate judges have made no secret of their frustration lashing out repeatedly at the way the government attorneys are handling cases and the shoddy quality of the judicial records they see on review judge richard posner of the 7th circuit recently issued a scathing ruling criticizing the immigration courts and the us justice departments office of immigration litigation for its handling of asylum cases the performance of these federal agencies is too often inadequate he wrote for a threejudge panel that overturned the denial of asylum for an albanian woman this case presents us with another depressing example posner continued this case has been poorly handled by the government at every stage the proceeding before the immigration judge the

044166 dec 29 2005 two causes intending to address a backlog of over 60000 immigration cases former attorney general john ashcroft decided in 2002 to cut the number of bia judges from 23 to 11 and increase the use of singlejudge decisions additionally new regs broadened the type of cases in which the bia could issue summary affirmances without opinion essentially a single board member can review the decision of an immigration judge and write a onesentence opinion stating that the board affirms without opinion the result is that the ijs oral or written decision becomes the final administrative decision of the agency said geoffrey heeren senior attorney with the legal assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago a new law the 2005 real id act which bars noncitizens from seeking habeas corpus relief in district court for most detention and deportation cases has further inundated the circuits with immigration cases real id said were repealing the ability for people to go through district court and everything has to go through the circuits therefore anything pending in us district court including immigration cases is automatically transferred said laura lichter an immigration attorney in denver effects on immigration practice seasoned immigration lawyers say that the federal appellate process adds another layer of difficulty to a practice area where a vulnerable client population intersects with a labyrinthian administrative process added to that said lichter we often see sloppy lawyering at the administrative level and a poor record by the court so youre stuck with that record by the time you get to the circuit lichter who is an elected director of the board of governors for the american immigration lawyers association said that researching and writing an appellate brief is a specialized and demanding function that some firms used to a volume practice are not set up to do to do it right takes time and effort and were seeing that some of the appellate lawyering is really not up to snuff she said further most immigration firms have multijurisdictional or national practices and this requires familiarity with more than one circuits rules jack richbourg an immigration attorney in memphis tenn has handled appeals before several federal appellate courts including the 2nd 4th 6th and 11th circuits its a complicated process to perfect an appeal to the circuit he said although the law is the same the local rules of procedure differ and as soon as you file an appeal they request you file a brief within 60 days and that puts a lot of pressure on lawyers richbourg also noted that the details can differ markedly some circuits require a joint appendix with opposing counsel while others ask that lawyers not include a joint appendix and each circuit has its own page limits and citation requirements another pitfall is that the circuits do not respond as quickly as district courts and some circuits routinely deny stays of deportation while an appeal is pending this can lead to kafkaesque consequences lichter recently represented a north african political asylum seeker who was deported during his appeal to the 10th circuit because the court denied a stay request after he went home we won his case i called him in algeria to tell him the good news but the 10th circuit doesnt have the authority to bring him back meanwhile to add insult to injury the published decision was all over the internet and my client was afraid he was going to be killed if we didnt shut down the sites lichter recalled the client was eventually allowed back in the united states only because his wife a us citizen had previously filed to legalize his status the decision is chaib v ashcroft 397 f3d 1273 10th cir 2005 the increased number of appeals may have its benefits however one advantage is there is now an opportunity to make law on issues that otherwise would not be decided were starting to see a more nuanced and fuller

600 of 997 documents san jose mercury news california january 11 2006 wednesday us attorney general court must stop mistreating immigrants byline howard mintz mercury news section a pg 1 length 860 words stung by mounting criticism of the nations immigration courts attorney general alberto gonzales on tuesday took the extraordinary step of launching a comprehensive review of how the immigration system is handling the pleas of hundreds of thousands of refugees and others fighting deportation each year in memos delivered to every immigration judge in the country gonzales expressed dismay at reports of poor treatment of aliens in the immigration system citing intemperate or even abusive conduct he declared that the work of the immigration courts must improve the immigration courts are under the control of the attorney general and justice department gonzales call for an examination of the immigration courts has been triggered by a steady barrage of criticism from immigrantrights advocates and federal judges whose courts have been inundated with appeals from refugees and other noncitizens who insist their immigration cases are getting short shrift a mercury news series in september found noncitizens often get rapidfire justice in the immigration courts particularly since postsept 11 reforms downsized the board of immigration appeals which is responsible for reviewing the work of the nations 215 immigration judges the bia has been deciding many cases including life and death pleas for asylum in perfunctory boilerplate orders those decisions are being appealed and overturned in the federal appeals courts in unprecedented numbers the mercury news found now gonzales has ordered a toptobottom review of the system more than three years after former attorney general john ashcroft streamlined the immigration courts to push more cases through faster and clear a backlog as the agency tried to focus on keeping terrorists out of the country weve been encouraging this sort of thing to happen said mary schroeder the chief judge of the san franciscobased 9th us circuit court of appeals which has been hit hardest by a surge in immigration appeals this system needs to be improved there is no doubt about that a spokesman for the executive office of immigration review which oversees the immigration courts declined to comment on the gonzales memos which were sent to every immigration judge and every appeals board official denise slavin president of the national association of immigration judges told the associated press she welcomes the review we think the premise of the review may be somewhat faulty but hopefully it will allow us to get some additional resources slavin said gonzales did not include specifics in his memos about what prompted the review but most of the attention in the past year has focused on the lax review in the bia and cases where hasty or mistaken decisions by overworked immigration judges were allowed to slip through the cracks immigration judges handled more than 300000 cases last year including tens of thousands where asylum seekers many fearing torture or death if returned to their homelands rely on the immigration courts as their last hope to stay in the united states gonzales put a deputy attorney general and an associate attorney general in charge of the review the memo didnt specify a completion date the bias cursory handling of immigration cases has had profound consequences forcing many noncitizens to put their lives on hold as they wait for years until they find out whether they will be deported in one case reviewed by the mercury news the 9th circuit had to revive the asylum claims of a guatemalan refugee whose case was rejected by the bia without an explanation she was granted asylum last summer after six years of uncertainty the 9th circuit which covers california and eight other western states has been particularly tough on the immigration courts the mercury news found that nearly twothirds of the most important immigration cases in the west are so flawed when they emerge from the bia that they have to be sent back for further review other federal courts have stepped up the criticism as well in late december a chicagobased federal appeals court wrote that decisions coming from the immigration courts have fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice since ashcrofts changes were put in place the numbers of immigration appeals to the federal courts have jumped from 1760 in 2001 to nearly 11000 last year the 9th circuit now hears half of all of those appeals going from 954 immigration cases to nearly 6000 in 2005 immigration experts say it is particularly important for gonzales to fix the problems because a new law passed by congress reduces the ability of the federal courts to secondguess immigration judges in many asylum cases in addition the bush administration is pushing immigration changes that could add burdens on the immigration system lawyers who represent refugees while skeptical are hopeful gonzales will act on his concerns i think hes heard the hue and cry from many quarters about this said deborah notkin president of the american immigration lawyers

601 of 997 documents the new york times december 26 2005 monday late edition final courts criticize judges handling of asylum cases byline by adam liptak section section a column 6 national desk pg 1 length 1937 words federal appeals court judges around the nation have repeatedly excoriated immigration judges this year for what they call a pattern of biased and incoherent decisions in asylum cases in one decision last month richard a posner a prominent and relatively conservative federal appeals court judge in chicago concluded that the adjudication of these cases at the administrative level has fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice similarly the federal appeals court in philadelphia said in september that it had time and time again been forced to rebuke immigration judges for their intemperate and humiliating remarks citing cases from around the country the court wrote of a disturbing pattern of misconduct in immigration rulings that sent people back to countries where they had said they would face persecution the harsh criticism may stem in part from a surge in immigration cases before the federal appeals courts immigration cases most involving asylum seekers accounted for about 17 percent of all federal appeals cases last year up from just 3 percent in 2001 in the courts in new york and california nearly 40 percent of federal appeals involved immigration cases the increase occurred after attorney general john ashcroft made changes in 2002 to streamline appellate review within the immigration courts which are part of the justice department many federal appeals court judges say those changes essentially shifted work to their courts the justice department counters that the increase is largely unrelated to the ashcroft changes and is instead the result of a higher rate of appeals in the courts in new york and california jonathan cohn a deputy assistant attorney general in the justice department said the quality of the decisions rendered by the immigration courts on the whole was good noting that the government won more than 90 percent of the cases in the federal appeals or circuit courts the circuit courts do not see any of the tens of thousands of correctly decided cases that aliens choose not to appeal mr cohn said theyre only seeing a fraction of the cases and only a small fraction of those give rise to criticism but that criticism can be very sharp particularly given the temperate language that is the norm in the federal appellate courts in the philadelphia decision in september judge julio m fuentes of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit had this to say about annie s garcy an immigration judge or ij in newark the tone the tenor the disparagement and the sarcasm of the ij seem more appropriate to a court television show than a federal court proceeding judge garcy ordered qun wang returned to china where he said his wife had been forcibly sterilized hes a horrible father as far as the courts concerned judge garcy ruled saying mr wang was obsessed with having a son and did not pay enough attention to his daughter who is disabled all of that was irrelevant to the issues before judge garcy judge fuentes wrote returning the case to the immigration system for a rehearing before a different judge the factual issue before judge garcy judge fuentes wrote had been only whether wangs wife had been forcibly sterilized and whether if he returned to china the chinese government would inflict improper punishment on him for leaving the country through a spokeswoman judge garcy declined to comment in another decision judge marsha s berzon of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco said a decision by nathan w gordon an immigration judge was literally incomprehensible incoherent and indecipherable a crucial sentence in judge gordons decision she said defies parsing under ordinary rules of english grammar judge gordon ordered ernesto adolfo recinos de leon returned to guatemala notwithstanding mr recinoss testimony that he would be persecuted there for his political activities judge berzon sent the case back to the immigration system for another hearing judge gordon now retired did not respond to a request for comment a spokesman for the executive office for immigration review the unit of the justice department responsible for immigration adjudications declined requests for interviews with officials there but provided answers to written questions we would caution against drawing broad conclusions the statement said from a small number of cases in the federal courts the nations roughly 215 immigration judges the statement continued handle more than 300000 matters every year and the vast majority of ijs do an excellent job given such a large caseload denise noonan slavin the president of the national association of immigration judges a union affiliated with the aflcio said she was concerned about what she called the rising number of scathing opinions from federal appeals court judges to go namecalling and having an open season on judges its crossing the line of civility judge slavin said that is not to say that immigration judges dont make mistakes but lory diana rosenberg a former judge on the administrative body within the justice department that reviews decisions from immigration judges before they reach the federal appeals courts said the recent criticisms were warranted theyre a brave honest and proper reaction ms rosenberg said to a pattern of unfettered misuse of authority mary m schroeder the chief judge of the ninth circuit which hears almost half of all immigration appeals said the current system was woefully inadequate immigration judges she said are very unevenly qualified and they work under very bad conditions the people who appear before immigration judges often do not speak english and their cases often turn in part on changing political and social conditions around the world in a decision in march judge posner wrote that immigration judges lack of familiarity with relevant foreign cultures was disturbing judge slavin who sits in miami disagreed saying she and her colleagues often had a sophisticated understanding of conditions in the most relevant countries which are china for immigration judges in new york and philadelphia eastern europe for those in chicago haiti columbia and venezuela for those in miami and central and south america for those in california i know more about haitian politics than the people coming before me judge slavin said but she acknowledged both the difficulty and the importance of her work immigration law can be lifeordeath decisions in terms of whether youre going to send someone back to a place where they may be killed judge slavin said i have over 1000 cases on my docket most of us do about four decisions a day in texas on the border you might get 10 a day judges at the top and bottom of the system blame the administrative body between them the board of immigration appeals for the surge in appeals and the mixed quality of the decisions reaching the federal appeals courts the board is meant to act as a filter correcting erroneous or intemperate decisions from the immigration judges and providing general guidance the losing party can appeal the boards decision to the federal courts but the board largely stopped reviewing immigration cases in a meaningful way after it was restructured by mr ashcroft in 2002 several judges said mr ashcroft reduced the number of judges on the board to 11 from 23 they just hacked off all the liberals is basically what they did said ms rosenberg who served on the board from 1995 to 2002 mr ashcroft also expanded the number of appeals heard by a single board member and encouraged the use of oneword affirmances in appropriate cases the goal of the changes mr ashcroft said was streamlining the board had a backlog of more than 56000 cases which fell to 32000 by september 2004 at a conference at new york law school in september john m walker jr the chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in new york said the changes at the board level served to transfer its backlog to his court and other federal appeals courts he just moved the problem from one court to another court judge walker said of mr ashcroft in the two and a half years after april 2002 said john r b palmer a staff lawyer at the second circuit his court received twice as many appeals from immigration board decisions as it had in the previous 30 years combined several federal appeals court judges said they were frustrated by the quality of the boards review of decisions from immigration judges in his march decision judge posner wrote that the board often affirmed either with no opinion or with a very short unhelpful boilerplate opinion even when the immigration judge had committed manifest errors of fact and logic as a consequence judge walker said were the first meaningful review that the petitioner has in its statement the immigration review office said we absolutely disagree with judge walkers comment each decision that comes before the board is carefully reviewed by a staff attorney and at least one board member the statement said according to the office the number of oneword affirmances dropped this year to about 20 percent from about a third in previous years the solution to some of what recent criticisms identified as problems several federal appeals court judges said is to add positions to the immigration board and to require judges there to explain the reasons for their decisions at least write a couple of pages three pages said jon o newman a judge on the second circuit it would really help us an article to be published early next year in the georgetown immigration law journal concludes that the shift toward the federal appeals court was triggered by the high volume of bia decisions issued starting in march 2002 and a general dissatisfaction with the bias review in its statement the immigration review office disagreed the surge in federal appeals the statement said is not related to the boards increased number of decisions but the rate of appeal in some parts of the country immigrants appeal only 7 percent of the time the statement said in the states covered by the federal appeals courts in new york and california the appeals rate is now more than 30 percent at an argument in an appeal of an immigration case in september in chicago the three judges on the panel expressed exasperation with the current state of affairs does the justice department have any idea of what is happening to your cases in this court judge posner asked cindy s ferrier the government lawyer defending the decision of the immigration judge she said yes a second judge ilana rovner offered ms ferrier a measure of sympathy it is so cruel to send a lovely human being like you in here to be a messenger of such madness

614 of 997 documents the washington post april 23 2005 saturday final edition for immigrants help can be risky maryland lawmakers move to rein in consultants who overreach and sometimes get clients deported byline krissah williams washington post staff writer section financial e01 length 1017 words mariana c cordier president of the maryland hispanic bar association has heard an increasing number of complaints over the past year from people who say their immigration applications were botched by consultants the demographics have changed so much that you start to see these things happening more and more said cordier a rockville attorney the growing number of hispanics in the area has given rise to a number of immigration consultants she said consultants say they provide a useful service because they understand the immigration application requirements and charge less than lawyers to help with the paperwork but cordier said that in some cases immigration consultants have failed to file the correct papers causing their clients to be deported the maryland general assembly this month passed legislation that would give people who use immigration consultants more protection california washington new mexico and a handful of other states already have laws that regulate immigration consultants but the district and virginia do not according to the national consumer law center the maryland legislation known as the immigration consulting services act awaits gov robert l ehrlich jrs signature the bills lead sponsor del kathleen m dumais dmontgomery said she expects him to sign it in the next few weeks even if he vetoes it she said the act has enough support to override a veto it passed the house 121 to 5 and the senate unanimously the legislation curbs the services immigration consultants are allowed to perform and the claims they may make penalties include a fine of up to 1000 or a year in prison victims also have the right to sue to recoup the money they paid to the immigration consultant and to collect damages dumais said she has heard from a wide range of immigrant communities that have been affected by consultants including people from latin america vietnam and africa some immigration consultants say they welcome the oversight patrick tzeuton an attorney and the owner of immigration consultants inc in silver spring said his company caters to people who have recently moved to the area from cameroon in west africa services are offered mostly in french two lawyers work in the office with four immigration consultants who file forms for visa extensions or work documents many immigrants like to use the consultants because they are cheaper than lawyers said tzeuton it is no different than going to a pharmacist or a nurse instead of a doctor vincent rosario an accountant notary and consultant said he is careful how he advises people who come to him for help with immigration applications rosario runs his business crusa servicios latinos from his home in the district and also works from an office in sterling he charges customers 75 to 100 to help them complete an application for a temporary visa to bring a relative to the united states if a customer has more complicated issues or wants a work visa he said he refers them to a lawyer i dont play with that i dont give legal advice said rosario who emigrated from the dominican republic 20 years ago if i do give advice i let them know that it is not official some immigrant advocates and lawyers said other consultants do more immigration consultants are a particular problem among the spanishspeaking population because of the use of the spanish word notario said kimberly propeack director of advocacy at casa de maryland a takoma park nonprofit that works with latino immigrants many immigration consultants are notaries and in some parts of latin america a notario may conduct certain legal proceedings in the united states notary publics only administer oaths and attest to the authenticity of signatures sometimes notarios here say they can provide legal advice and help prepare immigration forms this is one of the biggest legal issues in our community propeack said they are really quite blatant jayesh rathod a staff attorney at casa de maryland who is working on three cases of immigration applications that were fouled up by consultants said he thinks the new law will have a deterrent effect up to now ive seen almost nothing done about such problems he added rathod is trying to help carlos gomez who moved to alexandria from el salvador get a work permit gomez paid an immigration consultant in falls church 30 to fill out his visa application when us citizenship and immigration services sent him a card requesting more information he took it to the consultant whose name he no longer remembers she told me they were crazy and that i didnt have to send in the information gomez said in spanish i trusted her and then i got another card saying they had denied me other immigrants testified about their problems before maryland legislators during the bills hearings amy nunez a mexican immigrant who lives in frederick told legislators that her husband who came to maryland without legal documents was deported to mexico after they enlisted the help of an immigration consultant who took 3000 from them and fled according to cordier the recently passed bill would force immigration consultants to return any documents that a customer gives them in some instances consultants have refused to provide copies of the paperwork they claim to have filed with us citizenship and immigration services some lawyers said the bill also makes it illegal to advertise that a notary license allows a person to provide legal advice and requires that immigration consultants provide a contract in both english and the customers native language before working on the customers behalf it also prevents consultants from saying they can obtain special favors from us immigration agencies and from collecting money from clients before they perform any services immigration consultants must also post signs in their offices stating that the consultant is not a licensed attorney and cannot give legal advice or services loaddate april 23 2005 language english publicationtype newspaper

immigration is a difficult and controversial issue that needs to be addressed urgently this at least is the one thing that both sides on the immigration issue can agree upon we have been hearing about immigration reform since before 911 when our minds turned to national security issues and immigration reform was placed on the back burner now it is back the bush administration is talking about pushing immigration reform as soon as this year in the meantime our current and obsolete immigration system is out of touch with reality failing millions of immigrants who want to immigrate legally these people often have to pay high fees hire an immigration lawyer to help them navigate the system and wait long periods of time up to seven or eight years to get a government response or to reunite with their families members meanwhile thousands of people who dont have the resources or opportunity to immigrate legally risk their lives and hundreds die each year illegally crossing our borders it has been estimated there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows working in poor and often dangerous conditions they are here filling the gaps in the labor market and even though many people argue that they are taking our jobs i have always thought if the system did not benefit from them mass deportations would have occurred long ago president bush has offered a controversial and muchcriticized plan to grant undocumented immigrants temporary legal status it would offer a threeyear work visa for immigrants already here and foreign workers seeking to come to the united states it does not provide a path to permanent residency for their part immigration advocates are pressing for a more comprehensive immigration system that calls for legalizing undocumented immigrants creating effective paths for permanent legal immigration and speeding up family reunification whichever side you are on 2005 will be a crucial year for immigration reform no one knows exactly what reforms will be put into effect but the good news is that it is back on the table bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows will not only require congress to look closely and objectively at all the facts but also to weigh the real costs and benefits of immigration fairly please write to gloria sánchez at aztecavnetnet or to nuestro pueblo the heraldsun po box 2092 durham nc 27702 el difícil y controvertido tema de la inmigración necesita ser abordado con urgencia por lo menos esto es lo único que los ante y proinmigrantes están de acuerdo se había hablado de una reforma migratoria mucho antes de los ataques del 11 de septiembre después de los ataques nuestra atención se enfocó en la seguridad nacional y la reforma migratoria quedó atrás ahora regresa a nuestra mesa la administración de bush está de nuevo diciendo que propugnará una reforma migratoria el próximo año y toda nuestra atención está en ello mientras tanto nuestro sistema presente y obsoleto de inmigración está fuera de la realidad y continúa sirviendo a millones de inmigrantes deplorablemente gente que quiere inmigrar legalmente gente que tiene que pagar altos precios contratar un abogado de inmigración para que los ayude a navegar el sistema y esperar largos períodos hasta siete u ocho años para obtener una respuesta o para reunirse con sus familiares del otro lado de la moneda miles de personas que no tienen los recursos o la oportunidad de inmigrar legalmente arriesgan sus vidas y cientos mueren cada año al cruzar la frontera ilegalmente existen aproximadamente más de 10 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados que viven en las tinieblas y trabajan frecuentemente en condiciones inaceptables y peligrosas ellos están aquí llenando las necesidades del mercado laboral y aunque mucha gente disputa que le están quitando los trabajos a los estadounidenses yo siempre he creído que si el sistema no los necesitara y no se beneficiara de ellos hace mucho tiempo hubiera habido una deportación masiva lejos de esto nuestra atención está en que algo se debe hacer para regularizar a los trabajadores indocumentados el presidente bush ofrece un plan muy controvertido y criticado que les daría a los trabajadores indocumentados un estado legal temporal ofrece una visa de tres años para inmigrantes que ya están aquí y para otros extranjeros que quieran venir a los eeuu no provee la oportunidad de inmigrar permanentemente por su parte los proinmigrantes están apoyando una reforma migratoria más inclusiva un sistema que legalice a los indocumentados cree canales legales de inmigración permanente y acelere la reunificación familiar no importa de qué lado esté usted sobre la reforma migratoria el 2005 será probablemente crucial en su proceso nadie sabe exactamente qué significa esto y cuando las reformas se apliquen lo bueno es que el tema está de regreso y que ojalá traiga cambios positivos sacar a los inmigrantes de las tinieblas no solo requerirá que el congreso esté bien informado y analice de cerca y con objetividad los hechos sino que sepa evaluar justamente los beneficios y los costos reales de la inmigración por favor escriba a gloria

retired engineer from weymouth showed up with one ally at a suffolk university law school forum dominated by the enemy immigration advocates were always outnumbered wherever we go he said casimiro 66 is executive director of the massachusetts coalition for immigration reform virtually the only organized voice in massachusetts for immigration restrictions the small but vocal group has grown to about 130 members since lorrie hall of duxbury helped create it in 1998 casimiro and hall said like most mainstream organizations that favor limiting immigration the coalition argues that immigrants cause sprawl and environmental problems by increasing the population bring third world diseases to the united states and take jobs and depress wages of american workers members want the government to cut back legal entrants to about 300000 people a year from the current 1 million and eliminate illegal immigration the united states is the fastestgrowing country in the world because of immigrants hall said cutting immigration by 70 percent might well have closed the door to armelino marchesini a 38yearold baker from quincy who became a us citizen on wednesday he arrived 10 years ago from brazil if someone comes from a country where the economic opportunity isnt there to meet your basic human needs thats what this country is all about said his wife diane kelleymarchesini who watched

slightly under the national average although casimiros coalition focuses primarily on legal immigration illegal immigration remains the hotbutton issue nationally last month voters in arizona passed a ballot measure to keep illegal immigrants from obtaining some government services and groups in georgia idaho california and colorado are considering similar proposals called proposition 200 the controversial arizona law is intended to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining food stamps welfare and other social services it requires proof of immigration status to obtain certain government services ali noorani director of the massachusetts refugee and immigrant advocacy coalition has heard the arguments for restricting immigration many times he counters that immigrants dont contribute to sprawl and pollution because most of them settle in environmentally efficient cities instead of suburbs that any international traveler can bring back disease and that lifting immigration restrictions will improve conditions for all workers by preventing exploitation of illegal aliens of casimiros coalition he says this is a group that is trying to incite the politics of fear lorrie hall and casimiro traveled different paths to their activism casimiro was galvanized by the terrorist attacks on sept 11 2001 he said like a lot of americans when that happened i was personally wounded he said after a year and a half of research into immigration policies he joined the coalition he said as for the immigrant heritage that he shares with most americans casimiro said the situation was different when his grandparents came to this country in 1905 from the azores the portugueseowned islands off west africa they came here legally and immigration levels were not so high he said hall who moved to duxbury from reading in 1997 was interested in reducing immigration for a long time because i was concerned about sprawl she said hall is a member of the sierra club the national environmental group that split sharply over immigration policy and its effect on the environment after members voted in 1998 not to support immigration restrictions as part of population control some continue to lobby for the cause although hall said she didnt form the coalition in response to the sierra club turmoil environmental issues drive her concern over immigration she said in duxbury i see every lot and farm being carved up hall said its the population push thats doing it although most americans have ancestors who were foreignborn antiimmigration causes have attracted supporters since the 1700s historians say hall and casimiro say their opposition to immigration is not based on race and say they dont have any quarrel with individual immigrants it upsets me when people refer to us as antiimmigrant casimiro said said hall it has nothing to do with racism it has to do with common sense yet casimiro talks of illegal mexican immigrants whose culture is antithetical to the american culture they have one party that ruled for years he said theyre not getting anything through their government so they have to disobey the law its understandable in mexico but we dont want that type of thing here noorani the immigration advocate said he and opponents like hall and casimiro can agree on one thing when i talk to them we both agree that the immigration system is broken he said they are always asking why so many illegal immigrants are coming in i would say its broken because its unfair and doesnt allow legal immigration both sides also seem to agree on another issue the limited success of the massachusetts coalition for immigration reform in making progress toward its goals we dont have a lot of influence because the advocates have been at it for a long time casimiro said our only voice generally goes through talk radio noorani said members of the antiimmigrant coalition try to get their views heard by following us around theyre not tapping

fight over changing the nations immigration laws so far the groups have sought to influence immigration legislation in the senate undertaken largescale demonstrations and united national womens groups and even as chances of an immigration overhaul have faded in recent weeks their efforts have mobilized women across the country when you ask people what images they think of when they think of immigration reform its often men scary looking scaling the border walls said pramila jayapal cochair of we belong together a national immigration campaign that focuses on women the idea that its really women and children that are the majority of immigrants to the united states is completely lost the groups see opposition to a comprehensive immigration overhaul as having a larger effect on gender equality and they say it is part of a war on women that devalues the work of female immigrants and keeps them vulnerable their opponents meanwhile see it as nothing more than a stunt to push a pro immigration agenda gender is immaterial to immigration policy they said saying a vote against immigration reform is a vote against women is dishonest and insulting said kristen williamson spokeswoman for the federation for american immigration reform which promotes policies that reduce immigration in reality a vote for amnesty and increased immigration is a vote against the american worker although household workers many of whom are immigrants began organizing as part of the feminist movement in the 1970s a comprehensive case for immigration as a womens issue was not made until 2010 when jayapal collaborated with feminist icon gloria steinem to write an article linking the issues since then the cause has brought together immigrant and feminist organizations including the miami workers center the georgia latino alliance for human rights the national organization for women and the global womens institute from our perspective the coalition in support of immigration reform has never been as big and diverse as it is now said natalie camastra a policy analyst for the national latina institute for reproductive health in september 105 women activists were arrested at an immigrant rights demonstration in washington the september protest was followed by nine demonstrations that targeted house of representatives republicans in different cities across the country all organized by we belong together according to advocates more than a quarter of employment visas go to women as the primary holders because the system prioritizes maledominated industries such as technology in addition more visas are available for workers with higher skills and education which many women cannot get in their countries of origin this means the majority of immigrant women rely on the familybased visa system and thus are disproportionately represented in the backlog of 43 million immigrants awaiting such visas the coalition of women says these elements of the immigration system make it harder for female immigrants including those who are already here their opponents say the us should not structure its system around needs of nonamericans women in both chambers of congress have collaborated with advocates to discuss provisions aimed at protecting women like creating more visas for femaledominated industries when the senate passed comprehensive immigration legislation in

to the women senators and garner their support because the gang of eight didnt think of this she said adding that the bill written by the eight male senators inadvertently disadvantaged women by putting an emphasis on highskilled work in the house congresswomen have united in the congressional womens working group on immigration reform chaired by rep lucille roybalallard dcalif we want to

speaker john boehner rohio said nov 21 that congress needs to address the issue editors story can end here opponents of the senate plan said that the us must focus on americans best interests

629 of 997 documents the washington post april 24 2004 saturday final edition va seeks new role against illegals police to enforce immigration law byline mary beth sheridan washington post staff writer section a section a01 length 1256 words the federal government will soon grant a group of virginia state police officers the power to enforce immigration law making the state the third in the country to adopt the practice since the attacks of sept 11 2001 local officials said the tentative agreement between the us department of homeland security and the virginia state police permissible under a 1996 law is part of a movement across the country to grant local law enforcement officials more authority to detain illegal immigrants proponents say the expanded powers will give police more tools to combat terrorism gang violence and other crimes but immigrant advocates counter that the practice could lead to ethnic profiling and some police officials including dc police chief charles h ramsey are openly opposed to the idea and say it could discourage immigrants from reporting crimes the debate illustrates the complexity of improving security in a country that is home to an estimated 8 million or more illegal immigrants three of the 19 hijackers in the sept 11 attacks were part of that underground population but so are millions of workers and families in communities across america homeland security which enforces immigration laws acknowledges that it does not have enough agents to track down all those undocumented immigrants virginia officials decided to seek extra immigration powers for some state police officers after participating in local and federal task forces on terrorism and gang violence we had this recurring discussion about our inability at some times to deal with illegal immigrants when we were involved in other types of investigations said col steven flaherty superintendent of virginias state police while the police had worked with federal immigration authorities over the years he said their resources are limited as well so you dont always have them available to you until recently local and state police could not make arrests on civil immigration violations although they could detain immigrants for criminal offenses and sometimes helped federal immigration authorities with transportation or security but a provision of a 1996 law allows federal authorities to deputize local or state police to enforce immigration law flaherty said he and other officials discovered that two other states florida and alabama had sent dozens of state police officers to be trained in immigration enforcement under the federal program since the sept 11 attacks virginia then contacted homeland security to do the same michael j garcia who oversees immigration enforcement for homeland security said federal authorities were not urging state police to receive the training but were happy to provide it if asked so far he said the program has worked well if you look at our resources we are limited its been i think helpful to have additional people out there who are skilled in it and who can do the enforcement of immigration law he said obviously we watch to see thats being done appropriately under the agreement being negotiated about 50 virginia state police officers would be able to enforce federal immigration law in addition to their other responsibilities flaherty said the officers would be stationed throughout the state with one attached to each of the 24 drug task forces in virginia he said they would be under the supervision of federal authorities when carrying out immigration enforcement flaherty said the officers who may begin training as early as next month would use their immigration authority only in special cases were not going to plan any sweeps of illegal immigrants and whatnot we just want this tool to use in other cases he said in addition to participating in the homeland security program virginia recently passed a law that would permit state and local police to arrest immigrants who were back in the country after having been convicted of felonies and deported the sponsor of the house measure del david b albo rfairfax said that fighting terrorism was the original motivation for introducing the legislation but that it might ultimately be more useful in combating gang violence both the new law and the homeland security program for state police will likely result in only a small number of arrests but immigrant advocates are concerned that the measures could lead to officers mistakenly detaining people who are here legally quite frankly immigration law is pretty complicated said judy golub of the american immigration lawyers association noting that there are myriad visas and permits allowing people to stay in the country she pointed to a case that occurred in 1997 when immigration agents and local police arrested more than 400 people in chandler ariz in an operation targeting illegal immigrants some of those detained turned out to be legal residents the arizona attorney generals office later concluded that the sweep violated residents civil rights and the city settled two lawsuits for more than 500000 jorge figueredo executive director of the hispanic committee of virginia a communityservice organization based in falls church said he was especially worried about the state law that allows police to arrest immigrant felons who have reentered the country after deportation the most important question is how are they going to do it he asked how are they going to know who fits those qualifications albo agreed that the law would be difficult to enforce noting that police cannot directly access the relevant immigration information because it is spread among various federal databases but he said he hoped that police officers could eventually call up such data on the computers in their patrol cars allowing them to enforce immigration law in the course of their work the virginia law follows a legal tradition in which states could authorize their police to enforce criminal rather than civil immigration violations said bo cooper former general counsel of the immigration service who now works at paul hastings janofsky walker such violations include reentering the country after being deported the movement to expand police authority to combat illegal immigration goes beyond a handful of states in congress rep charles whitlow norwood jr rga has introduced the clear act which would give state and local law enforcement authorities the power to routinely enforce federal immigration laws the bill has 120 cosponsors a similar measure has been introduced in the senate police and local officials nationwide have been sharply divided over the idea ramsey called a news conference in july to affirm that district police would continue their longtime policy of not asking people about their immigration status unless they were suspected of crimes and montgomery county executive douglas m duncan d wrote to sen barbara a mikulski dmd last fall to urge her to oppose the clear act a troubling consequence of this legislation is that it could cause members of certain groups not to report crimes or to come forward with information about crimes for fear of being deported he wrote some authorities have also said that their police departments do not have the resources to take on immigration responsibilities nobody expects federal immigration officers to make drunkendriving stops so they shouldnt expect local police to make federal immigration

governments are prohibited from adopting policies that prevent its employees from contacting federal immigration authorities about the legal status of any noncitizen or to report violations of us immigration law by any noncitizen these policies called sanctuary policies promise foreign nationals who have broken our laws that the municipality in which they live will help them in their lawbreaking by resisting efforts to report them to the proper authorities file said in a statement such policies are illegal naturally and have been rejected by the courts nevertheless some cities remarkably persist in maintaining their illegal sanctuary policies file said unfortunately the executive branch of the federal government has been for many years utterly derelict in forcing as is its duty municipalities to abide by the law the national council of la raza has defended sanctuary laws saying that collaboration between federal authorities and state and local municipalities is contrary to us case law and that it results in racial profiling police misconduct and civil rights violations la raza also charges that it undermines community policing efforts and that it undercuts effective lawenforcement and antiterrorism efforts by diverting resources and leading to additional litigation mr norwood has introduced the clear law enforcement for alien removal act that would among other things give state and local police agencies authority to enforce immigration laws the pending bill with 112 cosponsors of both parties also would grant state and local police agencies access to the

washington times section page one pg a01 length 2054 words immigration has had more impact on the face of america than any other social political or economic influence but the history of united states immigration policy can best be described in one word schizophrenic immigrants from around the world seeking political freedom and economic stability in the united states have been welcomed recruited and embraced some have become corporate leaders a few have been elected to high office others have been ostracized condemned targeted for arrest and even killed and while the american public consistently has called on the countrys elected officials to enact stricter immigration controls republicans and democrats on capitol hill and in the white house have sought to broaden americas immigrant base through new laws along with various amnesty and guestworker programs for illegal aliens already in the country on wednesday president bush proposed a new guestworker program which could see the legalization of millions of the illegal aliens now in the united states immigration experts and others said the proposal if approved by congress and fully implemented would further change the face of america mr bushs proposal has enraged proponents of stricter immigration enforcement who believe the federal government in the wake of the september 11 attacks should be bolstering security along us borders and tracking down and deporting the millions of illegal aliens already here they say guestworker and amnesty programs reward lawbreakers granting permanent status to those who have entered the country illegally while discriminating against those who seek legal immigration supporters of mr bushs plan say it allows employers to hire the workers they need gives illegal aliens now in the country a chance to legalize their status and will improve relations with mexico rep jeff flake who is cosponsoring a guestworker bill with fellow arizonan republicans sen john mccain and rep jim kolbe credited the president with presenting a rational and realistic vision of immigration reform president bush has got it right mr flake said a comprehensive temporaryworker program will dramatically improve the situation at our borders liberalized immigration laws and guestworker and amnesty programs continue to be pushed by what immigration experts call the elites members of congress top business and labor union executives and various religious leaders it has been those socalled elites according to the immigration experts that have had the most immediate impact on the countrys vast immigration system beginning most prominently in 1965 when congress passed the landmark immigration and nationality act which ended a national origins quota system james w ziglar former commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service ins now an agency within homeland security said the 1965 law changed our immigration policy dramatically opening the us border to immigrants from asia and latin america but the law lacked the flexibility we needed to accommodate our own society mr ziglar said with mexico a labor source on our border it contained no quota difference for that country than it did for other countries in distant parts of the world he said and if you dont deal with a problem youre going to end up with a problem the problem the new law created mr ziglar said was increased illegal immigration by mexican nationals and others looking to follow relatives and friends who had immigrated legally to the united states for jobs a wave of humanity that continues today we have 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens in the country today and a government grappling to figure out what to do with them he said it is an ongoing debate with no likely resolution as the war on terrorism focuses the countrys attention on border security few government policies can have so profound an effect on a nation as immigration said steven a camarota director of research at the districtbased center for immigration studies cis large numbers of immigrants and their descendants cannot help but have a significant impact on the cultural political and economic situation of their new country but americas immigration policy is and has been in chaos complete incoherence mr camarota said we have never put up the money it takes to either run such a system or to guarantee enforcement we have created a very large immigration system but not the infrastructure it takes to manage it in any coherent way mr camarota noted that the rate of increase in legal us immigration coupled with a dramatic rise in the number of illegal aliens coming annually to the united states does seem to be without precedent in recent years adding that efforts have to be made to overhaul the system and reduce the total numbers because legal immigration is so large it has helped drive illegal immigration he said the bigger the legal population the bigger the illegal population this chaos will continue until you restore integrity to the system bring the numbers down and then decide in a careful way what increases are warranted according to the us census bureau the countrys foreignborn population in march 2002 was 325 million about 115 percent of the total us population 522 percent of whom were born in latin america this compares to 197 million foreignborn residents in 1990 14 million in 1980 and 95 million in 1970 according to census bureau records in addition between 8 million and 12 million illegal aliens are believed to be living in the united states mostly mexican nationals with anywhere from 1 million to 3 million more expected this year according to us border enforcement officials rules changed described at the time as part of a sweeping overhaul of americas immigration system the 1965 act eliminated the country of origin as the basis for approving a persons legal entry to the united states changing americas immigrant population from one predominantly european nearly 90 percent to latin american and asian which now make up about 77 percent beginning in the 1820s and running through 1890 a period known as the era of mass immigration immigrants attracted by reports of economic opportunity and religious and political freedom came to the united states mainly from great britain ireland germany norway sweden and the netherlands between 1890 and 1910 the vast majority of new immigrants were from austria hungary italy and russia in 1924 the government enacted legislation that for the first time set limits on the number of people who could legally immigrate to the united states from specific countries the limits were based on the number of people from those countries already living in america mr camarota said the 1965 law came on the heels of the civil rights movement passed by a congress concerned that existing us immigration laws discriminated against asians and hispanics he said the lawmakers responded to their new civil rights sensibilities but failed to anticipate the enormous desire of immigrants to come to america particularly those from mexico the difference between the standard of living in the united states and almost everywhere else is so vast that the desire to come to this country is equally vast he said according to a recent justice department report of the 1063732 persons who immigrated legally in 2002 to the united states 219380 were from mexico 71105 from india 61282 from china 51308 from the philippines and 33267 from vietnam those five countries accounted for 41 percent of the nations legal immigrants illegal immigrants illegal immigration according to lawenforcement authorities and immigration experts continues to affect the face of america aided in part by various guestworker and amnesty programs authorized by both republican and democratic administrations over the past 20 years since 1986 congress has passed seven amnesty proposals targeting more than 57 million illegal aliens dan stein executive director of the federation for american immigration reform fair said amnesty and guestworker programs like the one proposed last week by mr bush encourage additional illegal immigration mr stein also noted that when legal migration numbers are high illegal immigration totals also increase he said fair with 70000 members nationwide has sought enhanced border security an end to illegal immigration and the establishment of legal immigration levels it believes are consistent with the national interest about 300000 a year as history has proven conclusively amnesties do not solve the problem of illegal immigration they encourage even more illegal immigration the message that is disseminated loudly and clearly throughout the world is that its time to start lining up for the next amnesty program he said once a pattern of dealing with illegal immigration through amnesty programs is established there will be no end to the number of people prepared to get in on the deal he said considered key among government efforts to revamp its immigration system was the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca a onetimeonly deal passed by a republicancontrolled senate a democraticcontrolled house and approved by president reagan as part of a compromise package between those who wanted to reduce illegal immigration and others who wanted to wipe the slate clean by granting legal residency to illegal aliens already in the country irca also mandated employer sanctions or fines for those who knowingly hired illegal aliens the sanctions still on the books rarely have been enforced but the 1986 law resulted in amnesty for 27 million illegal aliens mostly mexican nationals who had lived and worked in the united states for anywhere from 90 days for agricultural workers to a year for others in addition it also granted legal residency to 160000 spouses and children of those aliens lawenforcement authorities and immigration experts said the act also increased illegal immigration as others sought to find a way into the united states to take part in the plan many through the use of easily attainable fraudulent documents according to a study by the center for immigration studies the total net cost of the irca amnesty the direct and indirect costs of services and benefits to the formerly illegal aliens minus their tax contributions after 10 years was more than 78 billion mahmud abouhalima a leader of the 1993 world trade center bombing by al qaeda terrorists was legalized as a seasonal agricultural worker as part of the 1986 amnesty law mr ziglar said it is unlikely the debate over immigration will ever be resolved because us sentiment about the role newcomers play in society will likely ebb and flow with events and with the strength or weakness of the us economy but he believes the country must first determine if it is committed to its heritage as a nation of immigrants and as a refuge for those escaping oppression and seeking opportunity or if such a commitment is relevant or necessary in todays america he said questions also need to be addressed on how to control the flow of illegal aliens across americas borders what to do about the 8 million to 12 million illegal aliens in the country and whether granting them amnesty was a reward for breaking the law and while continuing to address the threat of terrorism mr ziglar also said congress and the white house must decide how the united states protects the civil liberties of its citizens and noncitizens while securing them from the threat of a terrorist attack what we are witnessing today regarding immigration policy is not new there is no issue today that hasnt been debated throughout history he said in good times we oversee a fairly easy immigration policy in tougher times immigration becomes an issue and a problem it is however one of the most important issues this country must address and soon loaddate january 13 2004 language

arresting innocent people thanks for your coverage of the aclus report on immigration detainers in maryland aclu criticizes md police on immigration enforcement nov 19 unfortunately the claim made by us immigration and customs enforcement that immigration detainers are issued only against people ice has a legal basis to take into custody is false nationally between 2008 and 2012 at least 834 immigration detainer requests were lodged against us citizens people who are never properly the subjects of an immigration detainer the maryland data also showed that between 2010 and 2012 at least six immigration detainers targeted individuals from puerto rico who of course are also us citizens these incidents seriously undermine the claim that ice only issues detainers against individuals it has a legal basis for detaining and it raises critical due process concerns about immigration detainers another ice spokesperson claims that persons targeted by immigration detainers are dangerous criminals who would otherwise be left on the street that claim is completely undermined by the data which shows that in maryland the vast majority of immigration detainers are issued against persons charged only with traffic violations or minor offenses the same is true nationwide immigration detainer requests are issued at the sole discretion of a single administrative officer without any kind of review and therefore they cannot substitute for a proper determination of whether someone is potentially dangerous thats what courts and the criminal justice system are for state and local facilities are holding individuals who are not deportable and who should never have been detained in the first place because local law enforcement is being diverted from community policing to do ices job for it sirine shebaya the writer is an immigrants rights attorney with the aclu of maryland rosedale doesnt need more section 8 housing while you are espousing about how terrible it is that rosedale doesnt want lowincome or section 8 housing you should look up hollander ridge just saying no isnt good enough nov 20 hollander ridge was also in rosedale at pulaski highway and 62nd street it was built as housing for transplanted innercity folks primarily those whose homes in the franklinmulberry corridor were torn down for the highway to nowhere it consisted of a highrise apartments and town houses it wasnt long before this lowincome section 8 mecca became one of the most violent crimeridden areas in the county even the property itself was being destroyed by residents who lived there for next to nothing neighbors moved away in droves property values plummeted it became so bad that eventually the entire development was leveled and is being redeveloped as an industrial park do you think maybe rosedale is tired of this the expression is once bitten twice shy clay seeley owings mills finding support for lowincome housing in reading recent articles about the vote by baltimore county council to reject state funding for a planned affordable housing development in rosedale i felt troubled that certain unfounded attitudes toward voucher holders prevailed and am hopeful that there is an increased awareness that more affordable housing is needed throughout the county i was troubled by remarks that crimes go handinhand with voucher holders and that it doesnt matter whether section 8 occupancy is just a few residents or many more the community will be inundated with crime baltimore county council poised to block lowincome housing nov 18 reputable research groups have found no correlation between section 8 occupancy and crime instead they find that households who would rather use their vouchers in a safe opportunityrich neighborhood very frequently have to use their vouchers in communities that already have a high rate of crime my hopeful feelings stem from comments made by councilwoman cathy bevins and county executive kevin kamenetz after the vote was taken kamenetz council sent wrong message by blocking housing project nov 20 though ms bevins and mr kamenetz had opposing views on the planned development she said that the administration needs to figure out how to spread affordable housing throughout the county and mr kamenetz said that affordable housing needs to be accessible across the county and that he is exploring a variety of strategies for more affordable housing possibly including a law that prevents housing discrimination against people using vouchers in the past the beyond the boundaries program helped members of diverse catholic parishes to have sister relationships which was very helpful in breaking down stereotypical barriers more things like this today are necessary not only in baltimore county but in baltimore and in the whole region so that what mr kamenetz says he is exploring will have the broad support to actually happen brother jerry oleary baltimore loaddate november 26 2013 language english publicationtype

642 of 997 documents san jose mercury news california august 25 2003 monday morning final edition silent victims of immigration fraud for immigrants seeking legal residence consultants can offer hope and deceit byline edwin garcia mercury news section front pg 1a length 3836 words dateline salinas when immigrants in this farming community need help securing green cards work permits or citizenship they go to a woman known simply as gladys gladys jimenez has served thousands of immigrants since she opened her immigration consulting business nine years ago on a crowded strip alongside taquerias and 99cent stores but hundreds of her clients now face possible deportation after federal immigration officials concluded that paperwork filed on their behalf by gladys immigration service may be fraudulent in some cases applications for work permits apparently claim immigrants lived in the united states when they did not working for a farm thats existence cannot be verified separately the monterey county district attorneys office has begun an inquiry into her business allegations of fraud against consultants such as jimenez are common in california where breakneck immigration has created a great demand for help in navigating a bureaucracy that holds the keys to citizenship by law consultants can do no more than help clients fill out paperwork but experts say spotty enforcement and a lack of regulation leaves the door open for unscrupulous consultants to prey on undocumented immigrants charging them high fees for fraudulent services that can lead to deportation even when the immigrants have a legitimate chance to obtain legal residency the state provided no special means for enforcement when in 1986 it enacted laws intended to protect people from predatory consultants and a mercury news investigation found that few county district attorneys offices investigate consultants or regularly prosecute immigration fraud cases moreover federal immigration officials in california who suspect fraud generally leave it to the state to enforce its laws i would estimate that there are tens of thousands of people ripped off every year by this sort of fraudulent activity state attorney general bill lockyer told the mercury news his office has filed several civil lawsuits against consultants in bay area counties where district attorneys do not regularly investigate violations in many ways jimenez seems better than most in the business she meets californias basic legal requirements regarding immigration consultants she has registered a statemandated 50000 bond posted a sign in her office stating she is not an attorney and does not appear to advertise as a notario a spanish term that often means attorney jimenez denies doing anything illegal a former undocumented immigrant who once worked as a restaurant dishwasher she says she tries to help people who come to the united states as she did seeking a better life its a desperate feeling she said of being undocumented its like living in limbo jimenez started her business after borrowing books about immigration law and working as a consultant at a friends incometax office her clients many of them farmworkers trickle into her east alisal street storefront six days a week from 9 am to 630 pm often carrying documents bundled in worn plastic grocery bags they grab ticket numbers and sit in one of the 23 chairs in the lobby although jimenez employs three assistants some immigrants will wait more than an hour to speak directly with her in salinas where almost twothirds of the 151000 residents are latino jimenez is wellknown the only consultant people think of in a city without an immigration attorney the way i see it shes someone who helps the community said anallamas 34 who recently traveled more than an hour from her home in los banos to meet with jimenez but over the past year some of those helped by jimenez have received letters from federal immigration officials stating that documents she submitted for them appear to have been falsified jimenez meanwhile has been repeatedly accused by attorneys and immigrants of providing legal advice which is not allowed under state law but is difficult to track theyve forwarded complaints to authorities and wonder why shes still in business trying to keep up laws enforcement fail to curb abuse state legislation enacted in 1986 lawenforcement officials agree has done little to curb the abuse by unqualified or corrupt consultants the centerpiece of those laws the bond requirement was designed to drive off flybynight consultants and provide fraud victims a route to recourse not to regulate the industry lawmakers have taken small steps to update californias laws as immigration fraud increased after the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which granted some 27 million undocumented immigrants amnesty nationwide the amnesty was a boon to new consultants seeking to help the larger pool of immigrants and later their relatives apply for legal residency in increments over several years the bond amount rose from 10000 to 50000 but the state has no record of how often if ever bond companies have had to pay out a bond as a result of fraud as of this month 391 consultants in california are considered in good standing by the secretary of states office because they have posted bonds according to state documents but the department functions merely as a record holder with no authority to monitor or control the industry a mercury news review of those documents found that for unexplained reasons the state has no record of bond filings before 1995 underscoring the scant oversight of a system some lawenforcement officials would like to see changed moreover the review found that only 60 consultants have posted bonds in six area counties santa clara san mateo san francisco alameda santa cruz and monterey but at least twice that number advertise in the yellow pages as immigration consultants in those counties far more build their businesses by placing ads in ethnic publications and like jimenez by wordofmouth referrals among immigrants who share a language and culture such referrals were the root of one highprofile bay area case where up to 275 korean immigrants caught in a greencard scam now face possible deportation the immigrants applied for the green cards more than a decade ago with the help of four immigration consultants they met through a cupertino church who then bribed a federal immigration official in return for the documents the employee and consultants none of whom were bonded were convicted of fraud in federal court bonded or not consultants are rarely on the radar screens of district attorneys who say they seldom investigate immigration fraud because their offices are underfunded and overworked the santa clara county district attorneys office is unusual for having prosecuted 15 cases of immigration fraud that resulted in three convictions over the past two years few other counties keep track of the number of consultants if any they investigate in agricultural kern county which includes bakersfield prosecutors havent investigated a case in at least 14 years it doesnt mean its not going on its just that its not being reported said kern county deputy district attorney michael yraceburn in the case of jimenez many of her alleged victims are reluctant to contact authorities because they are living in the united states illegally even those who say they can prove theyve been wronged by jimenez will instead enlist the help of nonprofit immigrantrights organizations to straighten out their legal problems just today i had three people here who had problems with gladys jorge sifuentes an immigration specialist with catholic charities in salinas said recently prosecutors say there are several obstacles in addition to winning the trust of victims to fighting fraud by immigration consultants some forexample grapple with cracking down on unscrupulous consultants while not appearing to support illegal immigration said trevor white an alameda county deputy district attorney others concede investigating consultants is low on the priority list particularly in tough economic times lets put the cards on the table said chuck finney a consumerprotection prosecutor in san mateo county which has investigated two cases of immigration fraud in the past two years theres only so much you can do in a day the burgeoning business and the fraud that follows has increased throughout the united states and spread to areas experiencing an unprecedented influx of immigrants ive heard from people in new york in maryland north carolina all over the past year or so said nora privitera a lawyer with immigrant legal resource center in san francisco a nonprofit organization that sponsors national seminars to raise awareness about shoddy consultants rural areas such as the salinas valley are particularly ripe for such fraud immigration attorneys and advocates say because they are popular destinations for newly arrived undocumented immigrants and prosecutors tend to be less informed about laws regulating consultants searching for help reputation leads worker to woman among the many immigrants who have hired jimenez over the years is a 32yearold farmworker who recently learned he could be deported because of her assistance the man who left his hometown in michoacan mexico at age 19 spoke to the mercury news about his experience on the condition he not be named the farmworker qualifies for a green card because his father is a us resident but because he turned 21 while waiting for his application to be processed he was bumped down the us state departments waiting list that meant he would have to wait at least 10 more years before becoming a legal resident he met jimenez in 1996 after hearing coworkers rave about her assistance he wanted to know if she could expedite his green card already having waited four years i told her that i had received my acceptance document for permanent residency and wanted to know what she could do for me while i waited said the farmworker who now lives in salinas while jimenez couldnt speed up the process he said that for 350 she proposed another solution he could apply for a work permit while he waited for his green card to process the application jimenez needed evidence that he was in the country since 1988 the cutoff year for the socalled family unity immigration program he told her he arrived in 1990 dont worry he said he remembers jimenez saying he said she then urged him to find any documentation dating to 1988 even an old bus transfer he could find nothing earlier than his pay stubs as a farmworker dating to 1990 but he said that for another 100 jimenez assured him a work permit the farmworker who has a sixthgrade education and speaks little english says he didnt understand the details of the form he was signing which is only available in english in fact he was not eligible for the permit under the family unity program and couldnt legally work while waiting for his green card which he says he didnt realize until last year a lawyer for jimenez dana mendelson said she suspects the farmworker had to have known what he was signing jimenez says she has never skirted laws for people who otherwise do not qualify for benefits asked why she advertises work permits which are relevant only to a small group of qualified immigrants she said that doesnt mean we will get work permits with that sign i am referring to the renewal of work permits jimenez said recently in a telephone interview from her native peru where she said she was visiting to relieve stress we can help fill out forms for a work permit and all a person has to do is put it in the mail within six months of submitting his application the farmworker said he received his work permit from the nowdefunct immigration and naturalization service jimenez he said also helped him secure subsequent renewals papers questioned federal office finds holes in applications but last year while awaiting a fourth renewal he received a letter from the ins california service center in laguna niguel stating he was ineligible to work the letter dated sept 26 2002 said he failed to sufficiently account for his presence in the united states in 1988 and 1989 he wasnt alone after a review of several hundred applications prepared and notarized by gladys jimenez the service has found an unusually high number of documents that appear to be duplicates in style and content the letter read therefore the service questions the authenticity and veracity of the documents submitted to substantiate your employment with felix farms from april 1988 to july 15 1991 the farmworker was outraged he had never worked at a felix farms never heard of it i panicked he said because i knew i could be deported an immigration attorney he consulted vilma guerrero of santa cruz suspects jimenez somehow obtained falsified pay stubs she and other attorneys along with legal experts from nonprofit immigration help centers who are representing former jimenez clients say theyve seen dozens of similar letters most of the time she takes uneducated people who are very vulnerable said sifuentes the immigration specialist with catholic charities of jimenez a mercury news search of business records in salinas and unincorporated monterey county where the vast majority of agricultural work takes place found no existence of a felix farms a search of statewide records also came up empty an address for felix farms wasnt listed in the farmworkers letter you are altering my information for immigration purposes and this could jeopardize my case the farmworker said he told jimenez he demanded that she contact immigration officials to explain how she obtained proof of his residence before 1990 he then contacted sifuentes who warned the farmworker that he could be in danger of deportation because he signed for the work permit application under penalty of perjury sifuentes referred the farmworker to guerrero several attorneys had previously complained to lawenforcement officials about jimenez and other consultants but got nowhere weve tried to get the state agencies state attorney general district attorneys offices to use their enforcement power to clean up some of this and so far there hasnt been much movement on that front said michael meuter a supervising attorney with the california legal rural assistance office in salinas lawyers at the nonprofit watsonville law center have helped former jimenez clients fill out consumer complaint forms that were forwarded to the monterey county district attorneys office over the past year the district attorneys office declined to comment about jimenez and wouldnt say whether she was under criminal investigation frustrated immigration attorneys and other immigration service providers in santa cruz and monterey counties last year formed a task force in part to educate prosecutors and the public about fraudulent immigration consultants jimenez remains largely the focus the group enlisted rep sam farr dsalinas who had become aware of jimenez through three staff members who handle immigration matters farr shares the frustration of those who wish federal state and local law enforcement would crack down on consultants its probably the fault of all these government agencies for not doing their job said farr whose office coordinates the central coast immigration task force state laws have to be changed when to probe different jurisdictions have different standards farr and other taskforce members are astounded that the bureau of citizenship and immigration services and its predecessor the ins noticed a questionable pattern in jimenezs work but apparently instead chose to target her clients immigration officials say theres good reason and it has to do with federal regulations while jimenez meets the requirements to be a consultant in california she doesnt belong to a more exclusive network of immigration service providers who are recognized by the federal agency those who are recognized as accredited representatives by the us board of immigration appeals can act as consultants as well as represent clients at immigration hearings if jimenez were an accredited representative immigration officials would have investigated her immediately said donald w neufeld director of the california service center in laguna niguel the regional office that flagged her paperwork neufeld whose signature appears on the ins rejection letters wouldnt specify how jimenez came to the centers attention but a former aide to farr yvette agredano who was trained in immigration matters by ins officials in the late 1990s said the agency first knew about questionable applications from gladys immigration service in 1998 agredano said ins employees told her they had redflagged questionable documents from jimenez but could do nothing because federal laws apparently had not been violated a mechanism needs to be established to secure collaboration among the bcis district attorneys office state attorney generals office said carina chavez who replaced agredano in january 2001 and has met many of jimenezs clients all of these agencies witness immigrationconsultant fraud through various lenses neufeld said immigration officials in his southern california processing center can investigate a case if they suspect fraud they also generally provide the information to a local immigration office or an appropriate state agency for further action even if the consultant is unaccredited i couldnt tell you what we did specifically in that case he said of jimenez we dont comment on cases that may or may not be under investigation he referred further questions to the san jose district immigration office which includes salinas bay area spokeswoman sharon rummery declined to say what investigators knew about jimenez jimenez says she draws a line between whats legal in the immigration business and whats not when cases require legal advice she said she refers clients to a private attorney we can never tell a client if they will qualify for something jimenez said that would be against the law jimenez said she received a letter a few months ago from the monterey county district attorneys office asking her to disclose details about how she operates she suspects prosecutors are investigating her because other salinas consultants could have complained envious of the dozens of clients that seek her assistance every week as long as ones conscience is clean jimenez said one has to keep working she hopes to open a second location warning signs some immigration consultants will make exaggerated claims to lure clients who are desperate for help attorneys and immigrant advocates say people should be suspicious of those who promise immigrants work permits right away us visas within a few weeks quick processing of immigration papers because they know officials at the federal bureau for citizenship and immigration services legal status under the socalled 10year law a provision of immigration code that applies only to certain undocumented immigrants the process involves placing immigrants in deportation proceedings but some consultants dont make that known source immigrant legal resource center

650 of 997 documents the new york times december 8 2002 sunday late edition final the nation alien nation for immigrants the watchword suddenly is enforcement byline by philip shenon section section 4 column 1 week in review desk pg 4 length 950 words dateline washington in the annals of washington policy debates few have been as emotional and seemingly insoluble as those involving immigration should the governments immigration agencies focus on law enforcement policing the borders to block the entry of illegal immigrants or on services to welcome hardworking new immigrants to american shores should the governments priority be keeping the bad guys out or helping the good guys in to a degree that has startled immigrantrights groups and the many industries that depend on immigrant labor and with surprisingly little serious debate on capitol hill or anywhere else that argument was settled for the time being with congresss approval last month of the landmark bill creating the department of homeland security the law appears to represent a decisive victory for advocates of tighter borders and immigration lawyers are predicting turmoil next year as millions of wouldbe citizens and other immigrants already confronted with tough new immigration rules imposed after the sept 11 attacks try to make sense of the mammoth new agency that will control their fates i think theres going to be total confusion said judy golub senior director of advocacy for the american immigration lawyers association our members are getting a lot of calls from immigrants who feel that they are the ones being isolated not the terrorists the homeland security bill passed in the house and senate by huge bipartisan majorities and quickly signed by president bush mandates the biggest government overhaul in half a century merging 22 federal agencies into the new department all tasked with preventing new terrorist attacks on american soil few of the agencies being moved into the new department face a bigger overhaul than the immigration and naturalization service which has been part of the justice department under the reorganization the nearly 30000 employees of ins long seen as one of the most dysfunctional and demoralized bureaucracies in washington will be divided into two new agencies with lawenforcement programs separated from immigration services like the processing of green cards and citizenship applications aides to tom ridge the white house domesticsecurity adviser who has been nominated by president bush to run the new department said their goal is to do both jobs better yes enforcement is the primary responsibility of this department said gordon johndroe mr ridges spokesman but this is a welcoming country that was created by immigrants and we are going to do as much as we possibly can to make services more efficient and helpful to the immigrant community advocates on both sides of the immigration debate say they are still trying to make sense of the massive homelandsecurity legislation its 475 pages are written in such dense legalese that courts will likely be deciphering it for decades but they agree that lawenforcement programs especially those designed to block potential terrorists from entering the united states will take precedence they also note that the new departments enforcement arm will have a much stronger advocate at senior levels of the administration given the finite federal resources and the new priorities advocates worry that immigrant rights and services are at risk enforcement seems to have won the debate said mark s krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies a washingtonbased group that backs tighter immigration laws where theres a choice the government is going to err on the side of enforcement lawenforcement programs including border control will be moved into the newly created bureau of border security which will be overseen by asa hutchinson a former republican congressman from arkansas who now runs the drug enforcement administration and is a white house favorite immigration services which include the processing of new citizens and of people claiming asylum will be moved to the bureau of citizenship and immigration services the chief of that bureau has not yet been named whomever that turns out to be the citizenship bureau will have no clear equivalent to mr hutchinson to wage its bureaucratic and policy battles instead the citizenship bureau will report to the deputy secretary navy secretary gordon r england has been nominated for the post and mr england is sure to have many more pressing duties than worrying about the details of immigration services the bush administration appeared to signal its priorities for the new department when the white house last month announced that a veteran federal prosecutor michael j garcia would run the ins in its final months of existence and that he would shepherd the immigration agency into the new homeland security department mr garcia is best known at the justice department for his work prosecuting terrorists including the planners of the 1993 world trade center bombing attorney general john ashcroft described mr garcia as someone who will lead tough enforcement of our immigration laws to protect americans from terrorism and protect our homeland the naming of mr garcia is cited by immigrantrights groups as evidence that the administration intends to erode immigrant rights and to erect new barriers to immigration as it steps up the war on terrorism mr garcias entire involvement in immigration issues was as a prosecutor said angela m kelley deputy director of the national immigration forum a pro immigration group there is now a tainting of all people who come to this country as suspected

1152 words dateline washington april 25 the house voted overwhelmingly today to abolish the immigration and naturalization service and divide its functions between two new bureaus one for immigration services like the handling of citizenship applications the other for enforcement the lopsided vote 405 to 9 reflected lawmakers frustration over the agencys missteps before and after sept 11 indeed the bills sponsors said its provisions were only the beginning of a long process to overhaul the way the nation protects its borders enforces its immigration laws and provides services to millions of immigrants the two bureaus that the bill calls for would report to a new associate attorney general for immigration affairs at the justice department the immigration services parent the role of that new official appears certain to be a contentious issue as critics noted today the bill would give the official broad authority over immigration policy but no direct budgetary or personnel authority the house vote followed four hours of floor remarks in which legislators voiced pentup frustration with an agency notorious for long delays surly service and antiquated computers while always exasperating the bungling suddenly constituted a national security threat after sept 11 many lawmakers said this bill is not a panacea said the house judiciary chairman representative f james sensenbrenner jr republican of wisconsin whose committee drafted the legislation it will take a long time for us to put our immigration affairs back in order but this is an essential first step a parallel senate bill sponsored by senators edward m kennedy democrat of massachusetts and sam brownback republican of kansas is expected to be introduced next week the senate judiciary committee is to hold a hearing on it next thursday sensing that the momentum for a legislative solution to the immigration services woes had overtaken the agencys own fixit effort the white house unexpectedly abandoned its official neutrality and private opposition to the house bill late wednesday and endorsed it today attorney general john ashcroft said the administration still objected to some of the bills details mainly the new associate attorney generals relative lack of authority but mr ashcroft said the measures broad outlines to create greater effectiveness and efficiency in immigration matters closely tracked the goals that george w bush promised while campaigning two years ago and later as president it is time to separate fully our services to legal immigrants who helped build america from our enforcement against illegal aliens who violate the law mr ashcroft told reporters on capitol hill before the vote the idea of reorganizing the immigration service one of the governments fastestgrowing agencies with 37000 employees and a 62 billion annual budget has been a legislative perennial since the late 1970s the agency has staggering paperwork backlogs and sharply differing mandates it is responsible for policing thousands of miles of border with canada and mexico and for immigration enforcement within the country while also charged with providing benefits to millions of the nations newest residents but efforts to restructure the agency have always failed a victim of inertia or lack of consensus the attacks on sept 11 and the focus on security afterward changed all that the 19 hijackers on sept 11 were all foreignborn men living in the united states on temporary visas and at least two were in violation of their visa conditions then in march an immigration service contractor sent visa extensions for mohamed atta and marwan alshehhi two of the dead hijackers to the florida flight school where they had received instruction that was the last straw even for the agencys remaining backers on capitol hill we saw in the 911 incident some of the problems in the ins that many of us had seen before representative richard a gephardt of missouri the house democratic leader said before the vote today it became clear i think to everybody in the country and in the congress that we needed reform in a rare display of bipartisanship republicans and democrats on the judiciary committee one of the most polarized in congress reached compromise on a bill earlier this month the bill would create a bureau of immigration services and adjudications responsible for handling matters like visa petitions and citizenship and asylum applications and a bureau of immigration enforcement which would oversee the border patrol immigrant detention centers and immigration inspectors of the few lawmakers who voted against the measure today several said the changes did not go far enough for instance the administering of immigration benefits would continue to be split among the justice labor and state departments as under current law unfortunately the bill brought to us today simply rearranges the boxes on the existing organization chart of the ins said representative jim kolbe republican of arizona while immigration advocates and other specialists said the legislation was an important first step they voiced concern that the house bill would not adequately coordinate those service and enforcement functions that are inextricably linked immigration inspectors at airports for instance are the first line of defense against terrorists but they are also the first officials encountered by a foreigner seeking asylum in addition the administration and senate democrats complained that the new associate attorney general would have less authority than the current commissioner of immigration and naturalization there are significant problems with the house bill senator kennedy said in a statement today and i am concerned that it does not provide the necessary leadership and authority to make immigration reform a reality it is also unclear how the reorganization envisioned by the bill fits into a proposal under consideration by mr bush to create a new border security agency another step that would require congressional approval under that plan proposed by tom ridge the director of homeland security the border patrol which is now a part of the immigration service would be merged with the customs service now a part of the treasury department and the new combined agency would fall under the justice department mr ashcroft said today that the immigration service would continue its administrative overhaul until congress pushed through its own plan immigration advocates generally supportive of the legislative effort said they would be watching carefully as it evolved we need an agency restructured to meet the goals of a safer country but also one that welcomes immigrants said angela kelley a deputy director of the national

byline by susan sachs section section a column 1 national desk pg 11 length 1314 words for years most local police departments have resisted the idea of using their officers to track down illegal immigrants reasoning that crimefighting is better served by building relationships of trust in immigrant communities now in the wake of the sept 11 attacks a growing number of law enforcement agencies around the country say that they have begun to equate immigration enforcement with protecting national security and that they want to be involved in the starkest example of the turnaround florida will soon become the first jurisdiction to accept a longdormant federal plan to deputize local police officers as agents of the immigration and naturalization service florida officials say they are completing an agreement with the justice department the immigration services parent authorizing 35 state troopers sheriffs deputies and city police officers to make an arrest solely for overstaying a visa or entering the country illegally the immigration service which has long concentrated on border control and employs just 1947 agents for internal enforcement calls the new arrangement with florida revolutionary and is actively promoting such partnerships with other states the justice department declines to identify any additional states with which it might be in negotiations although south carolinas attorney general charlie condon is backing a bill in the state legislature to follow floridas lead the framework for such agreements has been in place since 1996 when they were authorized in an overhaul of immigration laws a handful of efforts were made then by immigrationcontrol groups and local legislators around the country to empower local police officers to arrest illegal immigrants all were blocked by opposition from immigrant groups and employers the indifference of local law enforcement agencies and in some places like new york city strict laws or policies protecting otherwise lawabiding illegal immigrants from being turned over to the immigration service but were in a different situation now said the north miami beach police chief bill berger president of the international association of chiefs of police now weve got a situation where people feel truly fearful that we may have people in the country who might want to hurt us or kill us all 19 hijackers on sept 11 were foreignborn men living in the united states on temporary visas and at least two were in violation of visa conditions as many as 12 had lived briefly in florida which helps explain that states eagerness to work with the immigration service federal officials say the intent of the partnership with florida is not to storm immigrant communities looking for everyone in the country illegally but to bolster the resources of the understaffed immigration agency in its search for high priority illegal immigrants short of such formal agreements local police agencies have already been drawn into immigration matters they once deemed too timeconsuming or peripheral to their essential duties since sept 11 for example many have participated in the governments antiterrorism task forces hunting for middle eastern and muslim immigrants who have ignored deportation orders a federal felony groups that have long supported a crackdown on illegal immigrants and the enlistment of state and municipal police forces in the effort have now renewed their campaign by framing it in terms of fighting terrorism islamic terrorists have penetrated every aspect of our immigration system dan stein executive director of the federation for american immigration reform a washington lobby said in a statement this week but at a time when the foreignborn population has reached a historic high and when an estimated eight million illegal immigrants most of them hispanic are spread across the country others warn of risks in using police officers in the pursuit i dont think the immigrant community would have confidence anymore in the police said dolly hassan an immigration lawyer in queens where a vast majority of residents are foreignborn or the children of foreigners the police here have always done a tremendous amount of outreach to convince immigrants that information about their status wouldnt be shared so that they will come forward to report crimes since the attacks the justice department has made abundant use of immigration laws to arrest hundreds of muslim men for visa expirations and to hold them for months as potential terrorism suspects state and local law enforcement officers on the other hand ordinarily do not have the power to arrest a foreigner for an immigration violation except for ignoring a deportation order and the difference in authority does not end there immigration agents have wider latitude than even other federal law enforcement officers to make arrests without a warrant and to single out ethnic or national groups after the terror attacks attorney general john ashcroft also gave the immigration agency power to detain indefinitely without bringing charges any foreigner deemed a security risk a police officer acting as a deputized immigration agent then would not have to meet the criminal justice systems usual standard of probable cause when arresting a foreigner that officer might be asked to arrest a foreigner who was acting suspiciously or was believed to be an associate of a terrorist group a senior justice department official said someone you have information about but you dont have enough to arrest him on under existing criminal law the justice department has already used immigration data to pursue those it considers potential terrorists and to gather intelligence and has prevailed upon local police agencies to assist last year for example the police in many states were asked to interview 5000 young immigrant men from countries linked to terrorism some departments including three in oregon refused saying that as they interpreted state privacy laws they were forbidden to question immigrants who were not suspected of any crime some jurisdictions prohibit the police and other public employees from reporting illegal immigrants to the federal government in new york city a 1985 mayoral executive order that has since become incorporated into city regulations provides that illegal immigrants can be turned over to the immigration service only when they are suspected of separate criminal activity it was designed so people wouldnt sit in their houses worrying about whether a new york city police officer is going to come knocking on their door because they overstayed their welcome said walter l burnes a department spokesman detective burnes said the police department did not now envision asking the justice department to deputize its officers as immigration agents similarly spokesmen for the governors of new york new jersey illinois and michigan all immigrantheavy states said agreements along the florida model were not under consideration still there are signs that more than ever before local law enforcement agencies are taking it on themselves to look out for illegal immigrants the immigration service said queries from the police to its law enforcement support center which runs a registry of foreigners and their legal status had increased sharply since september to 30000 a month from 20000 sheriff john cary bittick of forsyth county ga whose jurisdiction includes a 60mile stretch of interstate highway that is a favorite route for immigrant laborers said he would be interested in having his deputies empowered to act as immigration agents like anything else said sheriff bittick president of the national sheriffs association we in law enforcement had to

816 words dateline washington jan 18 even as the number of immigrants seeking permanent residency in the united states grows the backlog and waiting times for applicants have declined for the first time in seven years the immigration and naturalization service said today at present someone applying for a green card granting permanent residency must wait an average of 12 to 15 months down from 33 months in 1999 officials said the wait varies greatly by region with some cities like houston and new york faring worse than the national average the backlog of applicants in the fiscal year 2001 dipped to 980000 people just below the peak of more than one million people a year earlier the backlog had grown steadily from 121000 people in 1994 causing delays for students refugees spouses of permanent residents temporary workers sponsored by employers and other applicants immigration officials ascribe the declining backlog and waiting times to several factors the immigration service has hired 1200 more adjudicators in the last three years for a total of 6559 the budget for processing citizenship and other service claims increased to 650 million this year from 440 million in the fiscal year 1999 and officials have bought new computers were beginning to turn the corner an immigration official said were catching up the bush administration and its new commissioner of immigration and naturalization james ziglar have set a goal to process all claims for permanent residency within six months immigration officials said the goal was to meet that national average by this october and for all regional offices to meet it by the end of the fiscal year 2003 there are large pockets of improvement said michael maggio an immigration lawyer here who said he had noticed faster service for clients in washington and baltimore but other immigration lawyers and immigrant advocates were skeptical about the agencys rosier numbers and forecasts of improved service it sounds wonderful but i dont buy it said joanne c adlerstein head of the immigration law practice at proskauer rose in newark i have not seen any improved efficiency ms adlerstein said she told many of her clients that they would probably get speedier service if they returned to their home countries and applied for immigrant visas from there people wait in limbo forever for years so what theyre saying is promising said sara t campos a staff lawyer for the national immigration law center in oakland calif but itll take awhile for it to filter down the backlog in adjusting immigrants legal status stems from the mid1990s when the immigration service facing mounting delays in processing citizenship applications shifted resources to address that problem that starved other parts of the immigration bureaucracy which were unable to keep pace with a growing number of applicants seeking to change their legal status changes in the law also fueled big increases in applicants congress last year briefly reinstated a process that allowed many illegal immigrants to apply for legal residency without first having to return to their country of origin as many as 400000 immigrants met the original filing deadline april 30 2001 after paying a 1000 fee to avoid having to return to their home country the total number of new applicants for permanent residency in the fiscal year 2001 jumped sharply to 754000 from 456000 in the fiscal year 1999 immigration officials said the increased personnel and better computers allowed them to approve 695000 filings last year compared with 264000 in 1999 even before the attacks on sept 11 applicants underwent background checks by the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency since the attacks arab and muslim immigrants who have applied for citizenship and other services have faced increased scrutiny immigration lawyers said lawyers for arab and muslim clients said that the number of applications accepted by the immigration service had not declined since the attacks and that the processing times were consistent with those of other applicants but the lawyers said their clients faced more questions than nonarabs there has been a greater scrutiny of naturalization applications as well as other applications when it comes to arabs and muslims said ashraf nubani an immigration lawyer in springfield va mr nubani said 60 percent of his clients were arab and muslim immigrants of legal resident status this may be an unspoken type of thing he said the ins may have sept 11 in the back of their minds of particular interest to

665 of 997 documents the atlanta journalconstitution january 10 2002 thursday home edition board charts new course on criminal aliens byline julia malone source cox washington bureau section news pg 11a length 915 words washington an obscure immigration appeals board at the us justice department has drawn attention for allowing some aliens who committed crimes to avoid deportation recent decisions of the 19member board of immigration appeals raised negative reactions from critics but applause from supporters of lessstringent immigration policies more than five years ago congress stiffened laws that require foreigners to be deported if they are convicted of a serious crime the quasiindependent board reviews decisions by the immigration and naturalization service as well as federal immigration courts in a recent controversial case the board stopped the deportation of a haitian nanny convicted in the beating death of the 18monthold child in her care melanie jeanbeaucejour 44 was sentenced to a maximum of six years for seconddegree manslaughter in new york in 1995 and released two years later the ins moved to deport her and won backing from a federal immigration judge in march however the appeals board blocked her removal in a decision reported in the washington times and that remains under seal the newspaper reported that a threemember panel from the board blocked the deportation because it would cause her family and her americanborn children severe emotional hardship the board has determined that the crime that she was convicted of does not automatically require her deportation appeals board spokesman rick kenney said late last week the board says this crime does not meet the conditions established in law as a crime of violence kenney is an official with the executive office of immigration review which includes both the immigration courts and the appeals board in december attorney general john ashcroft agreed to consider an ins request to overrule the appeals board on jeanbeaucejour a justice department spokesman said friday that the matter was still under review the immigration appeals board most of whose members were appointed during the tenure of janet reno as attorney general under president bill clinton has changed its makeup in the last decade most of the members once came from law enforcement and prosecution backgrounds but reno added several board members from immigrant advocacy groups and universities the clintonera change was welcomed by advocacy groups for immigrants even as critics complain the board now leans too heavily toward aliens most of the boards estimated 30000 annual rulings are not circulated widely although a few are published as precedents for the immigration courts among the recently published decisions a korean national who had been convicted of theft as an 18yearold was spared deportation after a judge trimmed his decadeold oneyear suspended sentence from a year back to 360 days at less than a year the suspended sentence no longer was grounds for automatic deportation that solution was accepted by the immigration appeals board in september and posted on the justice departments internet site its a great proalien proimmigrant decision because theres been a lot of setbacks for criminal aliens john t riely said riely is the lawyer for min song who had been given a suspended sentence for stealing fire extinguishers in a halloween prank what the board is saying is go back to the trial court and fix it if possible riely said he said he has received dozens of calls from lawyers and clients who want to pursue the same strategy in a related case issued in march 2001 the appeals board halted the deportation of a belize citizen who had been convicted and sentenced to jail for burglary and unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor in 1998 the board said that robin juraine crammond no longer fell under the mandated removal provisions of the law because more than a year after his conviction the state of california reduced his sex crime from a felony to a misdemeanor and in yet another published case the appeals board decided in may that a mexican national who was convicted of drunken driving for the third time could be granted the protection of resident status as the husband of a us citizen the appeals board ruled that drunken driving was not a crime involving moral turpitude and thus does not exclude him from residential status in arizona such rulings have raised questions among critics who long have charged the us government with weak enforcement of immigration laws one of the weakest links in enforcement is the board of immigration appeals mike hethmon said hethmon is counsel for the federation for american immigration reform a group that favors restrictions on immigration most of the outrageous cases that you hear coming out of the immigration courts tend to be influenced by the immigration appeals board he said however nadine wettstein a lawyer with the american immigration law foundation countered that the appeals board continues to decide against aliens in most cases wettstein noted that the board recently rejected a plea from her group to provide an englishlanguage interpreter for an indian citizen who is seeking asylum groups such as federation for american immigration reform are just used to the board issuing decisions that are not protective of immigrant rights wettstein said so when there are some few that do they get a little bent out of shape on the web wwwusdojgoveoirefoiabiabiaindxhtm

success rate in legalizing his clients who come mostly from india tanzania and west africa other groups especially those from mexico have less success in arguing for asylum based on political or ethnic persecution he said nearly all the approximately 250000 matters that come before immigration courts each year involve immigrants who came illegally often with false credentials or none at all or who have broken criminal laws among their possible routes to legalization in immigration court showing evidence from their employer of the value of their work proving family ties to a us citizen or showing that they should be granted asylum because of fear of persecution if they are sent home although the majority fail to make their case to immigration judges or fail even to appear for hearings the odds have been improving slightly in decisions made in fiscal 1996 the judge ordered the immigrant removed in 82 percent of the cases and granted relief in only 10 percent by fiscal 2000 the removal rate dropped to 79 percent with relief ordered in 15 percent of the cases more getting relief an increasing number of immigrants who are unsuccessful in making their case to ins inspectors are finding relief in immigration court in fiscal 2000 immigration courts granted asylum to 9170 people a substantial jump from the 5131 who won asylum in 1996 federal officials including immigration

ordered the cases against the seven other missing immigrants to be closed unless the ins could restart the process by finding the people charged and informing them of the deportation proceedings the new standard could have a substantial impact on rulings in the nations 52 immigration courts which processed 45589 absentia cases in fiscal year 2000 about one of every five cases was a noshow the new standards could reduce the impact of an ins effort announced last week to find immigrants who have been ordered out of the country but who have disappeared before they could be deported the immigration service has said it will enter the names of more than 300000 of those missing deportees into the fbis crime database so that police officers will be alerted to them if they conduct routine computer checks during arrests even for minor traffic offenses fewer names will be added to the deportee list in the future as courts close the absentia cases administratively instead of issuing deportation orders it bodes ill for ever finding these people said mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies a research group that favors more restrictions on immigration

limits on deportations the ins has been notoriously bad about keeping accurate address records butterfield said even when immigrants notify the agency of address changes she also said the ins sometimes sends immigrants a notice of a hearing for an unspecified date and then waits years to file the document with the immigration court the appeals board rightfully says we need in some way to protect the aliens right here butterfield said immigration lawyers will be challenging deportation orders for many of the 300000 cases that the ins is turning over to the fbi she said many of the immigrants didnt realize they had been deported because the notice never reached them she said karen kraushaar a spokeswoman for the ins said the agency is studying the ruling but she said she had no response on its effects in the case that triggered the change in policy an el salvador woman known only by the initials gyr came illegally into the united states in 1982 and requested asylum the ins in part because of a political dispute over the influx of el salvador refugees took no action until 1997 when the agency sent a notice for an asylum interview to the womans last known address when she did not respond the ins followed up with a notice for a removal hearing which she also did not receive the ins then sought a deportation order in absentia which the immigration court rejected the immigration appeals board decision acknowledged that virtually every alien in the united states is under an affirmative obligation to report address changes to the government failure to comply may incur various penalties the ruling said it added that an absentia deportation order is not one of them on the web for more information check out the executive office of immigration review

670 of 997 documents the new york times november 28 2001 wednesday late edition final a nation challenged the immigrants us makes it easier to detain foreigners byline by david firestone section section b column 1 national desk pg 7 length 1125 words the justice department has quietly expanded its power to detain foreigners letting the government keep a foreigner behind bars even after a federal immigration judge has ordered him to be released for lack of evidence the change allows the immigration and naturalization service to set aside any release order issued by an immigration judge in cases where the agency says it believes that a foreigner is a danger to the community or a flight risk to have such a ruling set aside the service simply has to file a form that says it plans to appeal the decision to the board of immigration appeals if that board orders the detainee released the service can also set aside that order under the new regulation by taking the case to the attorney general immigration lawyers who represent many of the 1100 noncitizens held after the attacks on sept 11 are furious about the new rule saying it deprives the detainees of the fundamental right of bond hearings at such hearings analogous to bond proceedings in the criminal justice system immigration judges weigh the evidence to decide whether a detainee should be allowed to be freed on bond but now no matter the outcome of those hearings the government can continue to hold detainees by filing forms in one business day with this rule change the government can lock someone up on very little or even no evidence and throw away the key until they decide to let them go said david w leopold an immigration lawyer in cleveland who represents the first aliens affected by the new rule 11 israelis who continued to be detained after a judge had ordered them released in effect it just takes immigration judges out of the mix bypassing their role entirely two israelis remain in custody the american civil liberties union said it planned to challenge the rule in court as an unconstitutional violation of the right of due process for foreigners the american immigration lawyers association said the rule along with actions that permit eavesdropping on detainees conversation with their lawyers violated constitutional protections previously the immigration service could set aside judges rulings only in cases of clearcut criminal activity situations that are unusual because judges generally impose high or no bail in such cases the new rule signed by attorney general john ashcroft on oct 26 went into effect on oct 29 with no public notice it was published in the federal register on oct 31 eliminating the usual comment period before a federal rule takes effect mr ashcroft determined that swift action was necessary to prevent the release of aliens who may pose a threat to national security the immigration service part of the justice department said the rule was necessary because the current system might require the release of aliens who pose security threats before the agency could present its case to the appeals board because of the heavy ins caseload officials said it is occasionally impossible to present all the necessary evidence to an immigration judge its not that we dont have the direct evidence but in some cases we simply havent had time to draft enough material to prepare a warrant a spokeswoman for the agency karen kraushaar said immigration lawyers said in many cases such evidence of terrorist links did not exist or was based on flimsy connections like a similar last name to a hijacker or possession of a box cutter in other cases the government has refused to disclose its evidence to judges citing national security reasons immigration judges rarely release detainees when the government presents virtually any evidence of danger but in the current cases several judges have ordered releases because of a lack of evidence over the objections of the immigration service the 220 immigration judges are civil service employees of the justice department they were separated from the immigration and naturalization service in 1983 to strengthen their independence though the judges usually side with the immigration service on deportations studies show that they frequently impose lower bail than the service requests in detention cases some legal scholars say the new regulation stems from longstanding misgivings immigration service officials have about the judges the immigration judges were intended to be a check on the ins a set of decision makers who were not beholden to the agency said margaret taylor a professor of law at wake forest university but within the ins is a fundamental mistrust of the immigration judges supporters of the agency however say the new regulation is a natural outgrowth of the focus on terrorism richard samp chief counsel of the washington legal foundation said that immigration judges might be inclined to release detainees when the government based its actions on classified information but that the government had every right not to enter such information as evidence the attorney general has access to large amounts of classified evidence and has no interest in publicly disclosing it which would happen in an administrative proceeding said mr samp whose group has filed briefs to support the agency we dont think theres any constitutional problem with that when you disclose you inform you give terrorists a road map to american intelligencegathering techniques the nations chief immigration judge michael j creppy declined a request for an interview his spokesman richard kenney said judge creppy did not believe that the new rule undermined the authority or purpose of the immigration courts this doesnt change the decisionmaking role of the judges mr kenney said it does mean that the execution is a little softer and the ins gets more discretion over the years congress has granted wide authority to the justice department to run the immigration system the attorney general appoints the chief immigration judge and can change the detention rules by administrative order the supreme court has repeatedly found that foreigners do have some fundamental constitutional rights of due process as recently as june the court ruled that the government could not hold foreigners indefinitely because they are persons under constitutional protection civil libertarians said that the new rule violated the spirit of that decision clearly theres a concern for security at the moment and we recognize that said judy rabinovitz senior staff counsel for the immigrants rights project of the aclu but were concerned that theyre taking advantage of the public mood to go too far if you say youre

mike soraghan denver post washington bureau section a section pg a01 length 839 words washington in early september tom tancredo was standing in  front of a steamroller the republican congressman from littleton was a lone voice of  protest as president bush had mexican president vicente fox to a  state dinner the political question of amnesty for illegal  immigrants seemed not so much if but when but on a recent day in the emerald confines of his office  its clear the steamroller is now going in the other direction  during a meeting tancredos chief of staff jaqueline ponder  tells him immigration is a huge issue right now to underscore  the point another staffer tells him that after four months the  white house has returned his call top presidential adviser karl rove wants a meeting on immigration tancredo leans back in his leather chair and savors a short  laugh i draw a conclusion that weve been loud enough that someone  finally heard tancredo says i think its a positive tancredo is on a roll hes a thirdyear congressman with  little formal power but since hijacked planes crashed into the  world trade center the pentagon and pennsylvania the immigration  issues hes pushed for years from the sidelines are suddenly on  the lips of official washington amnesty has been shelved the immigration and naturalization  service which hes bashed repeatedly is up for a thorough  overhaul the idea of putting troops on the border no longer seems  strange to many and tancredo is in demand as the spokesman in congress for  those who think too many people are crossing the border hes been  sucked into the vortex of the 24hour news channels looking for  someone to give voice to those sentiments and his congressional  immigration reform caucus has swelled from 15 conservative  republicans to more than 50 lawmakers including some democrats tancredos been out in the wilderness hes been saying the  right things for the right reasons and hes been vindicated  said dan stein executive director of the antiimmigration  federation for american immigration reform theres so many  positive things that could happen by reducing immigration and   enhancing enforcement stopping terrorism is only one of them tancredos role has not been to pass legislation but to  create pressure that pushes the debate his way we raise issues and all of a sudden they end up in someone  elses proposal tancredo said that makes it hard to say what role hes played in the  immigration changes that have taken place but its even less  clear how effective tancredo can be in shifting the debate from  screening out terrorists to actually cutting down the flow of  immigrants across the borders tancredo is pushing a moratorium on all immigration his  caucus agenda includes a sixmonth suspension on visas into the  country eliminating a program that allows 50000 people into the  country from around the world and repealing a provision that  allows people to change their immigration status without returning  to their home country for many that departs from the flaws in the system that  allowed terrorists to slip into the country and returns to the  social and economic debate about immigration that existed before  the sept 11 attacks and on that he will find himself again fighting his own  president and fellow republicans even as he moved to tighten visa requirements bush said  thats not to say were not going to let people come into our  country of course we are rep george gekas rpa the gatekeeper in the house on  immigration as chairman of the immigration subcommittee gives  little encouragement to tancredo and his caucus saying curtly  theyll have their day in court immigration supporters even though theyve been put on the  defensive since the sept 11 attacks say they feel little threat  from tancredo and his caucus they say his ideas are too extreme  too antiimmigrant and just not likely to pass he is the loudest restrictionist voice in the house of  representatives said angela kelley policy director at the  national immigration forum but i hear everyone talking about the  need to isolate terrorists not to shut out hardworking people who  come here to join family members i dont think extreme measures  are likely to pass and there are signs that his caucus is starting to fray one  of the democrats he recruited to give the caucus bipartisan  credibility rep william pascrell dnj abruptly withdrew  recently he wont be any part of a caucus thats antilegal  immigration pascrell spokesman david filipelli said even tancredo himself sounds a little unsure about what he  can accomplish but he says he has a strategy when i got here somebody told me theres only one way to  get something done talk

673 of 997 documents san jose mercury news california november 6 2001 tuesday morning final edition new wariness toward foreigners recasts debate about immigration byline michael bazeley mercury news section front pg 1a length 1050 words with president bush and a growing parade of congressmen vowing to monitor international students and hunt down foreigners in the country illegally it is becoming clearer every day that the immigration debate has shifted dramatically since sept 11 just two months ago bush was hinting at amnesty for millions of illegal aliens and giving antiimmigration groups a headache now americans are casting a wary eye on foreigners and groups that want to restrict immigration are suddenly seeing their onceunpopular ideas increased border patrols tamperproof visas embraced at the highest levels of government this is a real opportunity said mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies which has been pushing for tighter immigration controls for years proimmigration groups insist the broader immigration issues whether to legalize undocumented immigrants or tighten immigration numbers have not been affected by the current events but signs abound of washingtons new attitude toward foreigners democratic sen dianne feinstein of california has proposed the most farreaching package of immigration reforms so far her bill would create a centralized database of visa holders and other nonus citizens pay for smartvisa cards encoded with iris images palm prints and digitized photos and halt student visas from countries on the governments list of terroristsponsoring states cosponsored by arizona republican jon kyl the bill would affect hundreds of millions of foreign travelers and international students our borders have become a sieve creating ample opportunities for terrorists to enter and establish their operations without detection feinstein told reporters last week bush speaking at the inaugural meeting of his homeland security council also targeted student visas administration officials say he favors a system in which students movements in the country would be monitored with the help of a huge electronic visa database other lawmakers are talking about abolishing the visa lottery program also known as the green card lottery which doles out 55000 permanent residence visas to countries with low immigration rates still others want to add agents along the vast and mostly unprotected canadian border just 334 immigration and naturalization service agents patrol the 3728mile northern border crossed annually by 100 million people many of the proposals echo recommendations made by antiimmigration groups immediately after the sept 11 attacks illustrating the new influence those organizations now wield in washington i think theres no question those groups have gained an immediate credibility said james gimpel a university of maryland professor who has written extensively about immigration their proposals make sense in a way they didnt two months before washingtons sudden embrace of immigration reform is perhaps best illustrated by the new popularity of rep tom tancredo a republican from colorado his immigration reform caucus has added about 15 lawmakers to its roster since sept 11 and tancredo was recently invited to a meeting with house speaker dennis hastert something he had begged for many times before the attacks to no avail some of tancredos proposals such as a sixmonth moratorium on all visas probably have little support but many of his ideas such as adding digital photos and fingerprints to visas are likely to be adopted krikorian of the center for immigration studies said he expects the new national mood will help several immigration reform candidates get elected in the next congressional elections for a long time krikorian said we had come to view the borders as an irritant that travelers and business people needed to overcome and congress by commission or omission acted to weaken them he added that seems to have changed but proimmigration organizations insist they are not ready to surrender on the contrary many insist the debate in washington has actually hewed to a moderate center some groups for example have been calling for new limits on the number of immigrants allowed in each year but that idea hasnt gained much support the antiimmigration groups have been tweaking their agendas to try to see how far they can go to see if they can strike while the iron is hot said doug rivlin of the national immigration forum but the politicians on this issue have made those people look increasingly isolated the moderate members have been saying dont overreact bushs consistent pleas for tolerance have helped set a moderate tone and a strong national feeling of unity since the attacks has stanched a widespread antiimmigrant backlash said josh bernstein senior policy analyst with the national immigration law center which promotes the rights of lowincome immigrants there is a recognition that were all in this together and that unity includes immigrants bernstein said before the attacks proimmigration groups were optimistic that bush would continue a shift toward more liberal immigration policies among the ideas being discussed was legalizing more than 3 million undocumented mexicans living in the united states krikorian said opposition to that idea has intensified and that there is no real possibility it can pass granting legal status to those living here illegally strikes me as ridiculous at this point krikorian said but proimmigration groups hope that proposal wont fall victim to the current effort to root out terrorists rivlin said the bush administration has kept up a dialogue with mexico and told mexican president vicente fox recently dont go away much will depend rivlin said on public sentiment next year gimpel believes the united states history as a nation of immigrants will prevent it from completely shutting down its borders he foresees a country that is still welcoming but with far more tightly regulated borders i think people still have this romantic notion of america as a place where people can come and be successful he said well now well update that and say its also a place where their backgrounds have to be checked first loaddate december 2 2001 language english

674 of 997 documents the lawyers weekly november 2 2001 lawyers seek regulation of immigration consultants byline gary oakes section vol 21 no 25 length 960 words victoria the man at the centre of the supreme court of canadas decision that paid immigration consultants do not have to be lawyers says they must be subjected to the same rules as those governing the legal profession ive always held the position publicly that immigration consultants should be properly regulated and licensedjaswant mangat told the lawyers weekly what happened in the united states on sept 11 makes it all that more important that the federal government should look into this so there is accountability just as there is with lawyers his opponent in law society of british columbia v mangat seems to agree with him immigrants and refugees are an extremely vulnerable portion of canadian society and they need to be represented by people who are licensed regulated and ethicalsaid howard berge second vicepresident of the law society we dont think the federal government ever intended to create an environment so that immigration consultants are not regulated at allhe added vancouver lawyer catherine sas who specializes in immigration matters said now that mangat has been decided hopefully the minister of citizenship and immigration elinor caplan will come forward and regulate consultants quickly douglas cannon of vancouvers elgin cannon associates who handles immigration and refugee law pointed out that you can be anybody and call yourself an immigration consultant there are numerous examples of disreputable immigration consultants who leave normally vulnerable people in a terrible predicament through bad advice and unethical conduct the federal government needs to protect immigrants and refugees by regulating standards of competence in this area ultimately what matters is that an advisor is giving good advice with professional standards and ethical considerations thats a minimum requirement to preserve the integrity of the immigration system eric rice president of the canadian bar association explained that we essentially supported the bc law societys case our complaint was not against immigration consultants as such we just felt that if theyre going to be in a responsible position with vulnerable people like that they should be regulated they should be supervised the same way lawyers are they should have the qualifications to act they should be insured the same way lawyers are they should be prevented from practising if theyre unethical or if they are incompetent not to say that all of them are that way at all rice said ottawa should regulate immigration consultants mangat now 58 and licensed to practise law in ontario and alberta suggested the federal government could come to some arrangement with the law societies so the immigration consultants could work with lawyers that way the lawyers would be responsible for the actions of their employees he said he was relieved at the top courts decision after an eightyear battle at the same time its a terrible thing to go through its very painful mangat now handles mostly immigration matters some matrimonial and criminal cases and a little real estateout of his mississauga law office he believes immigration consultants should have minimum standards so far as education and qualifications are concerned they should have trust funds and there should be severe penalties for any infractions but he feels the scc decision vindicates me and upholds the position ive had all along mangat was operating an immigration consulting business in vancouver in early 1994 when the law society applied to the bc supreme court for an injunction to prevent him and his firm from engaging in the ongoing practice of law in contravention of british columbias legal profession act it was eventually granted but was overturned by the bc court of appeal the law society appealed to the nations top court which dismissed the appeal on oct 18 the case dealt specifically with hearings before the immigration and refugee board writing for a unanimous scc justice charles gonthier found the provisions of the immigration act at issue to be valid and paramount over the provisions of the legal profession act as a result an injunction against mangat and his firm cannot be granted in respect of the activities complained of in any event the judge noted the issue is moot as mangat is now a practising lawyer and his company has since been dissolved he has no intention of returning to his former work of immigration consultant mangat said that among the intervenors the federal government supported my position the ontario attorney general took no position and the manitoba attorney general supported the law society justice gonthier noted that the term other counselis mentioned in the immigration act it is plain from the structure of the act that this expression is used in contradistinction to the terms barrister and solicitor lawyers are either barristers or solicitors so other counselmust mean nonlawyers the judge also said if there is a conflict between federal and provincial statutes in such cases the federal legislation will prevail according to the paramountcy doctrine in this case there is a conflict between both statutes the immigration act authorizes nonlawyers to appear for a fee whereas the legal profession act prohibits them from doing so dual compliance to both statutes is impossible without frustrating parliaments purpose the immigration act must therefore prevail justice gonthier also held that if parliament had intended to limit the meaning of other counsel to unpaid nonlawyers the section would have been drafted differently loaddate october 29 2001 language

section a page 16 column 5 national desk length 919 words the federal appeals court ruling yesterday in the elian gonzalez case reaffirmed legal principles that give federal agencies and particularly immigration officials wide authority the decision by a panel of the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit was a clear but somewhat lukewarm endorsement of the immigration and naturalization services position that only elians father not the 6yearold boy himself or his miami relatives could decide whether the boy would seek asylum although the courts should not be unquestioning we should respect the other branches policymaking powers the decision said the judicial power is a limited power to experts on family law the ruling was an endorsement of legal rules that generally declare that unless they are abusive parents speak for their children in deciding where and with whom the children live but some immigration lawyers said they were troubled that the courts decision gave the immigration service such wide latitude our concern is this is setting a dangerous precedent for other children who might need to seek asylum in this country said wendy young a lawyer and the director for government relations of the womens commission for refugee women and children the group works to increase refugees asylum and immigration rights internationally the court ms young said is placing in the hands of the ins the total discretion of deciding which of those claims it will hear and which of those claims it wont hear based on the childs age the judges suggested that if it had been up to them they might have made a different decision and considered whether elian needed asylum from the marxist cuban government but they said they were not permitted to secondguess a decision by immigration officials that fit within the range of reasonable choices even if that decision worries us some the three judges who ruled yesterday j l edmondson joel f dubina and charles r wilson were the same judges who ruled in april that elian had to remain in this country while his case was decided although the decision did little to change existing law some immigration lawyers said the judges handsoff position in such a highprofile case was likely to be taken by immigration officials as a signal that the courts would seldom intervene the ruling is worrying as a precedent in the sense that there are many cases in which minors mostly unaccompanied need to claim protection from persecution said arthur c helton an immigration law expert and a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations the womens commission for refugee women and children said 4600 unaccompanied children were detained for possible deportation by immigration officials last year an applicant is eligible for asylum under the law if he or she has a wellfounded fear of persecution based on political beliefs or membership in racial religious national or social groups in its opinion yesterday the court itself noted that the decision could hurt some children we recognize that in some instances the ins policy of deferring to parents especially those residing outside of this country might hinder some 6yearolds with nonfrivolous asylum claims the opinion said but the judges concluded we cannot disturb the ins policy in this case just because it might be imperfect elians claim for asylum began with an application filed by his greatuncle and later an application filed in the boys own name his father subsequently told the immigration officials that he did not want an application for asylum to be considered the boys miami relatives argued that it was by definition abusive for his father to insist on returning elian to cuba courts generally defer to the expertise of administrative agencies but in the area of immigration law courts have held that the authority of judges is even more limited because immigration policy is part of foreign relations where the executive branch is given wide authority some experts on immigration law said yesterday that they did not share the concerns of some immigration lawyers that the decision yesterday could harm other children david a martin a former general counsel of the immigration service said it was standard practice for the courts to recognize that immigration officials not judges are experts in making decisions about such issues mr martin who is a law professor at the university of virginia said the opinion yesterday was of limited reach because the immigration service conceded that some children could seek asylum even if their parents objected like when they were threatened with imminent harm in this case he said it became a question of line drawing when do you consider the wishes of the parent and when do you consider the childs case independently other immigration law experts said that given the facts of elians case it would have been extraordinary for a court to require immigration officials to consider an application filed against his fathers wishes there are cases in which courts have gone too far in refusing to review the decision of immigration officials said stephen h legomsky a professor of immigration law at the washington university school of law in st louis but mr legomsky said any court would come out this way in terms of the father having the right to decide

length 899 words dateline tallahassee while congress was squabbling last year about whether to bar more immigrants from entering the united states the number of legal immigrants jumped 27 percent to nearly 1million people these were people that the country welcomed as permanent residents to take  jobs or join their families here 915900 immigrants to be exact this represents a predictable spike in the level of immigration experts  say and the numbers should decline in the next few years among the us population of 270million last years immigrants counted as  03 percent yet the annual figures released tuesday by the immigration and  naturalization service renewed the debate in washington about whether and  how much immigration is good for the country there are three schools of thought  stop all immigration for several years until those already here can assimilate  let anybody come who wants to live in america the vast majority of them  will work and pay taxes  allow immigration but control how many people may enter and why they are coming aim to admit those who will be productive or who have family here  this is by far the majority view congress decided last year not to limit legal immigration any further but  it was busy on other fronts the laws it passed now make it easier to deport illegal aliens and make it harder for immigrants to claim asylum the new welfare system removes most benefits from legal immigrants  including the elderly and disabled sen ted kennedy and others plan a news  conference today to protest that law and president clinton has proposed to  change it benefits already are denied to the 4million illegal immigrants living in  this country unless their children are us citizens who were born here nothing passed by congress last year changed the quotas for people admitted  to the country legally however legal immigration is a highly regulated tightly controlled system  said jeanne butterfield of the american immigration lawyers association there are several reasons the immigration level was so high last year according to ins and other experts america is still experiencing an immigration bulge based on the 1986  amnesty program when 27million illegal immigrants were allowed to stay they have become citizens and are now sponsoring their spouses and children  as permanent residents the us does not limit the number of those family reunifications and about 300000 such visas were issued last year nearly 50 percent more than usual another 85000 visas left over from 1995 were added to the family category  in addition immigrants hired to work in this country largely in highly  skilled hightech jobs increased by 38 percent to 117499 it means the golden gate has been inched open slightly wider said  stephen moore of the cato institute which supports unlimited immigration  we should be proud to be americans the lamp is lifted slightly higher than  it was in the past the influx may be smaller than it seems many of the family members admitted to join us citizens already were  living here more or less legally the government decided not to deport the  families of immigrants granted amnesty in 1986 and has been letting them live  here and work the oneyear jump also was big because the 1995 figures were artificially  low ins was operating with new procedures in 1995 and fell behind so  thousands of people who should have been admitted in 1995 were added to 1996 the federation for american immigration reform which wants a moratorium on immigration complains that the numbers can only get higher or the waiting lists longer as more immigrants are allowed to sponsor family members responsible leaders have a greater responsibility to understand the  forces driving todays immigration to assess its true impacts on poverty  wage flattening public costs congestion crime and environmental  degradation said executive director dan stein in a statement even in raw numbers immigration is not at record levels as a percentage  of the population it is nowhere near the ellis island years in 1910  immigrants arrived at a pace of 12 for every 1000 residents now its 3 or 4  per 1000 a popular analogy among proimmigration people in washington is this  imagine yourself in a ballroom with 1000 people champagne flowing waiters  bringing around trays of hors doeuvres three more people enter the room  thats the impact of immigration hardly being overrun the population is becoming more foreign and the percentage of foreignborn americans has roughly doubled since 1970 but its still lower than at the

washington times section a page one pg 1 length 1005 words president obama said early thursday that he wants to make a major push to have congress pass immigration legislation this year but by late in the day the white house was confirming he will nominate someone with little immigration experience to head the department of homeland security administration and congressional officials said mr obama will turn to jeh johnson who was the top lawyer at the pentagon to run the agency that oversees the secret service the transportation security administration the federal emergency management agency and all three immigration services the president is selecting johnson because he is one the most highly qualified and respected national security leaders having served as the senior lawyer for the largest government agency in the world a white house aide said a nomination could come friday for the job which many observers say is the toughest in washington getting battered from all sides on issues of privacy and security and on how strenuously the department is enforcing immigration laws with the end of the government shutdown mr obama has elevated immigration to the top of his legislative agenda saying thursday that he will pressure house republicans to pass a bill following the lead of the senate which passed one in june this can and should get done by the end of this year he said adding that he expected it to be an area of cooperation with the gop some key republicans though said judging by the way the president refused to negotiate with them during the spending and debt fights hes squandered any chance to work with them now i think it would be crazy for the house republican leadership to enter into negotiations with him on immigration and im a proponent of immigration reform rep raul r labrador idaho republican said wednesday hes trying to destroy the republican party and i think that anything that we do right now with the president on immigration will be with that same goal in mind which is to destroy the republican party and not to get good policy where the senate passed a broad bill combining more spending on border security with a revamp of the legal immigration system and a legalization program for those in the country illegally house republican leaders have said they will tackle the issue in pieces speaking alongside mr labrador at the heritage foundation on wednesday rep matt salmon arizona republican said he had been promised by house speaker john a boehner that the house will not go to conference committee to work out differences with the senate on a big bill only on the small pieces a spokesman for mr boehner said the speaker was reiterating his longstanding support for a stepbystep process to fix our broken immigration system key to the house gops efforts will be a bill to legalize younger illegal immigrants known as dreamers house majority leader eric cantor of virginia is trying to write that bill along with rep bob goodlatte virginia republican and chairman of the judiciary committee mr johnsons nomination will help renew the immigration debate though his experience with the issue seems limited there doesnt seem to be any indication that he has any experience at all in immigration said rosemary jenks chief lobbyist for numbersusa which advocates for stricter immigration limits indeed reaction from either side of the immigration debate was muted as everyone tried to figure out what to make of mr johnson one tantalizing tidbit appeared in a short crains new york business profile in the 1990s noting that during his time as a young justice department lawyer he prosecuted corrupt politicians cops and immigration agents that might not sit well with immigration agents already bristling at what many argue is an administration that has chosen to turn an eye on illegal immigration while prosecuting border patrol agents for excessive violence sen jeff sessions an alabama republican who fought the senates immigration bill questioned whether mr johnson is the right man to reform the immigration services it would appear that the president plans to nominate a loyalist and fundraiser to this post this is deeply concerning he said this huge department must have a proven manager with strong relevant law enforcement experience recognized independence and integrity who can restore this department to its full capability but mr johnson earned words of encouragement from several key lawmakers including house homeland security committee chairman michael t mccaul texas republican and senate homeland security and governmental affairs chairman thomas r carper delaware democrat mr johnson brings a wealth of experience from the department of defense and i am eager to meet with him and discuss his vision mr carper said even if mr johnson is confirmed it will still leave major gaps at the department and in the three immigration services in particular us customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement the two immigration lawenforcement branches are without chiefs meanwhile the head of us citizenship and immigration services which administers immigration benefits has been tapped to be the homeland security departments deputy secretary but his nomination has been tied to a political scandal involving virginia democratic gubernatorial candidate terry mcauliffe with the growing threat of al qaedaaffiliated groups in africa mr johnsons nomination could get some pushback from senate republicans for his views that the terrorist network is rapidly deteriorating i do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point mr johnson said in a speech at oxford university late last year a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al qaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured such that al qaeda as we know it the organization that our congress authorized the military to pursue in 2001 has been effectively destroyed

706 of 997 documents the washington post november 18 1996 monday final edition immigration issues await new congress surging legal influx will be among topics of renewed debate william branigin washington post staff writer section a section pg a01 length 1219 words the farreaching immigration law that took effect last month has left many issues festering and legislators on both sides of the political divide agree that renewed debates are likely when congress reconvenes next year the law which was hailed as landmark legislation when it was signed by president clinton in september dealt with the relatively soft target of illegal immigration although there was broad agreement on the need to curb the influx of illegal aliens controversies over how to go about it nearly derailed the bill left over for the new congress is the much thornier question of what to do about legal immigration which rose sharply in 1996 and is projected to keep climbing next year the debate over legal immigration revolves around numbers at its core is the question of how many newcomers should be let into the country but while there seemed to be bipartisan support for reducing legal immigration in line with the recommendations of an independent commission last year efforts to legislate such cuts ran into stiff opposition not just from ethnic and immigrants rights lobbies but also from business according to the immigration and naturalization service legal immigration increased about 25 percent during fiscal 1996 from the previous year meaning that about 900000 people entered the country when other categories of newcomers are factored in such as asylum seekers and parolees granted special admission the total approaches 1 million the surge in legal immigration is attributed in large part to a decadeold amnesty law that legalized 26 million illegal aliens many of whom have become citizens and sought permanent resident status for their family members unlike other immigrant categories the visa allotment for immediate relatives of us citizens has no numerical limits the recent influxes have raised alarms in congress over the longterm impact of immigration particularly on the countrys population growth lawmakers concerned about the high levels of immigration also complain about the more immediate social costs of the system and a loss of control over who is allowed to immigrate the system they say is driven less by americas needs than by chain migration in which successive waves of immigrants bring in their relatives immigration imposes a burden on public schools and health services these restrictionists argue while it tends to depress wages in certain sectors and frustrates efforts to move americans from welfare to work what is needed now they assert is an immigration timeout so that those already here can be assimilated on the other side of the debate are members of congress from both parties who laud the historical contributions of immigrants to american life and who worry that cuts would prevent families from reunifying and deny businesses access to the worlds best and brightest immigrants have helped revitalize innercity neighborhoods and contributed to americas hightech edge these advocates say while in principle some may favor slight reductions it has proved impossible up to now to reach consensus on where to make cuts every proposal to reduce or eliminate a category of legal immigrants whether familybased or employmentrelated has provoked an outcry from those concerned meanwhile the influx seems to have taken on a life of its own with an impact far beyond the numbers usually associated with legal immigration the ins estimates for example that americas illegal immigrant population about 46 million is increasing by about 300000 people a year adding them to the total of about 1 million immigrants and asylum seekers then subtracting the estimated 200000 people a year who emigrate leaves a net annual addition of about 11 million people from all forms of immigration it is true that of this number an unknown percentage were already living in the united states when granted legal immigrant status on the other hand the total does not include more than 650000 people a year who are admitted for periods ranging from three to 10 years under several nonimmigrant visa categories state department figures show many of these nonimmigrants end up staying permanently according to the census bureau about onethird of population growth in the united states stems from immigration when usborn children of recent immigrants are included immigration accounts for more than half the population growth the bureau says the surge in legal immigration in recent years levels are double what they were two decades ago has contributed to a sharp revision of the census bureaus projections for population growth in the next century in 1989 the bureau forecast that the us population now about 265 million would level off at about 300 million by the year 2050 but in 1992 the bureau had to withdraw that projection largely because of trends in immigration and the fertility of nonwhite women the census bureau now puts the us population in 2050 at nearly 400 million by a less conservative estimate based on somewhat higher immigration it could even surpass half a billion the bureau says about 93 percent of the population growth in the year 2050 will result from immigration that has occurred since 1991 the bureau estimates citing these and other census statistics in a house speech earlier this year rep anthony c beilenson dcalif warned that far from leveling off the us population will continue to grow unabated into the late 21st century more immediately the new congress is expected to have its hands full with what some legislators say is the unfinished business of immigration reform sen edward m kennedy dmass wants to restrict the ability of employers to use temporary foreign workers to replace americans critics of jobrelated immigration say employers often use it to cut salary and benefit costs and that the influx of temporary workers tends eventually to drive jobs overseas and erode the us tax base kennedy a senior member of the senate committee that deals with immigration says he favors a modest reduction in legal immigration but indicates he is most interested in obtaining additional labor department inspectors and cracking down on employers who hire illegal workers the key question next year is whether we protect american workers or coddle the unscrupulous employers kennedy said other democrats want to roll back provisions of the new welfare and immigration laws that restrict benefits to legal immigrants and make it more difficult for people seeking political asylum to enter the country republicans meanwhile may try again to give states the option of denying free public education to illegal immigrant children and end automatic birthright citizenship for children born in the united states to illegal immigrant parents both highly controversial issues and sources of division within the gop the naturalization of record numbers of immigrants which has been under investigation by a

709 of 997 documents the washington post july 21 1996 sunday final edition should the united states close its doors peter skerry section book world pg x04 length 1218 words the immigration mystique americas false conscience by chilton williamson jr basic books 202 pp 23 the case against immigrationd the moral economic social and environmental reasons for reducing us immigration back to traditional levels by roy beck norton 287 pp 24 more than most issues immigration is characterized by a wide gap between elite and nonelite opinion while poll after poll has for years demonstrated overwhelming majority support for curtailing immigration our political and economic leaders have just as consistently held the opposite view and the elites have prevailed at least in the sense that since the overhaul of our immigration laws in the mid1960s legal immigration has steadily increased from about 297000 in 1965 to over 720000 in 1995 with a net annual addition of 300000 to 400000 illegal immigrants todays influx is equivalent in absolute numbers if not as a percentage of total population to the historically high levels immediately preceding world war i does this mean that our immigration policy simply reflects the efforts of manipulative and deceitful elites flouting majority opinion many americans seem to think this way so do the authors of two new books that challenge this elite proimmigration consensus in two very different ways one of these books is an utter failure the other an earnest but flawed effort yet both bring a message from the heartland that deserves to be heard chilton williamson jr a former literary editor for national review is currently the wyomingbased senior editor for chronicles a monthly out of rockford ill that has for years been articulating a cranky but provocative homegrown conservatism in the immigration mystique americas false conscience williamson starts off with a resounding critique of the prevailing tendency to reduce immigration to a question of economics as he forcefully puts it nearly everyone recognizes immigration as a moral dilemma too present to be ignored too significant to be fudged yet because it is an issue of moral as well as of practical complexity too many people having allowed themselves to become paralyzed morally and therefore intellectually fudge it anyway unfortunately williamson engages in some fudging of his own to be sure he scores some points against the proimmigration bias of many journalists who seem incapable of writing about the issue in other than heartwrenching humaninterest terms he also astutely identifies the relevant contradiction at the heart of our political culture precisely because we idealize america as a haven for those fleeing other nations we constantly fear its being corrupted by the rest of the world finally williamson usefully traces out the connections between proimmigration elites and their postwar view of americas world leadership role though from his perspective that role is an illconsidered temptation to empire that has undermined our republican traditions but aside from these insights williamson wanders aimlessly for 200 pages getting his facts wrong and making outrageous assertions at one point he faults americans during the 1920s for responding automatically and indiscriminately to novelties among them hot dogs spaghetti pizza and oriental food theres a good critique of an establishment proimmigration position to be made but this book doesnt come close to making it roy becks the case against immigration comes closer but falls short where williamson is the disaffected literary intellectual beck is the policywonkish journalist like williamson beck selfconsciously hails from the heartland and is very much a populist who sees the rich benefiting from immigration at the expense of ordinary working americans his 1994 atlantic article about the negative impacts of immigration on the small town of wausau wis was widely cited as an editor of the social contract a quarterly journal linked with the federation for american immigration reform fair beck has direct ties with the principal restrictionist lobby yet despite such advocacy roots beck is a reasonably reliable guide through a mounting body of evidence on the problems generated by immigration for example he shrewdly identifies a connection between immigration and the emergence of gated communities he also marshals the latest research indicating that up to a third of americas troubling economic inequality is traceable to immigration moreover beck adroitly supplements such statistical findings with case studies of how immigrants have transformed industries once dominated by nativeborn americans such as meat packing and poultry processing always balanced and never strident beck argues persuasively that immigration is a relevant but not necessarily primary factor in many of our economic and social problems perhaps most cogent is his discussion of the negative impacts immigration has had historically and contemporaneously on black americans yet beck goes astray when he attributes the breakdown of urban infrastructure including the need to replace washingtons woodrow wilson bridge to immigration induced population growth holding up boulder colos slowgrowth zoning as a model for the nation beck doesnt seem to recognize that such uppermiddleclass strategies collide with his populism excluding less affluent nativeborn americans never mind struggling immigrants such strained arguments succeed only in reminding us that the environmental and populationcontrol movements not organized labor or advocates for the poor have been important spawning grounds for antiimmigration activists similarly beck goes too far when he argues for a drastic reduction in the number of immigrants admitted down to 250000 annually and asserts that legal immigration could be stopped with a simple majority vote of congress and a stroke of the presidents pen in fact we have already had a test of this proposition in 1965 congress terminated the bracero program under which thousands of contract laborers had been brought here from mexico yet despite that legislative action mexican laborers continued to pour across the border only illegally the lesson is that immigration is an entrenched economic and social process that cannot be so easily legislated out of existence beck stumbles again when he observes that high immigration almost always has reflected the values and served the interests of a small elite at the expense of the national interest yet the values he refers to pervade this society americans esteem individual liberty which in this context means that we have consistently rejected policies that would provide the secure means of identification necessary for employers as well as public officials to determine an individuals immigration status without such measures we will never get a handle on our immigration problems but our

legal aliens william branigin washington post staff writer section a section pg a08 length 1013 words a battle in congress over immigration reform has left participants groping through a virtual fog of war to find the meaning of what they have done but this much seems clear an effort to fundamentally change americas immigration system lies mortally wounded in the crossfire of electionyear politics and the victors include one of the oddest alliances that washington has seen in recent years three days of debate on the house floor resulted in passage thursday of a bill that cracks down on illegal aliens but leaves out provisions originally intended to reduce legal immigration as well from the christian coalition and conservative republicans to the leadership conference for civil rights and liberal democrats the cast of characters opposing cuts in legal immigration was as broad as the array of issues encompassed in the overall reform effort there were concerns about organized crime welfare big government family values civil liberties population growth economic competitiveness the protection of american workers and freedom from religious and political persecution nevertheless opponents in the fight agree that the debate has fundamentally changed since congress seized on the immigration issue a year ago thanks largely to the emergence of a potent if ephemeral coalition whose driving force seems to be americas hightech industries in a sense the house immigration bill that passed overwhelmingly thursday signified a repudiation of the bipartisan commission on immigration reform which last year recommended significant cuts in legal immigration the recommendations of the commission under the leadership of barbara jordan provided the basis for the reform bills that took shape in the house and senate and that sought to deal comprehensively with both legal and illegal immigration both have now been changed substantially the senate version was split this month in the judiciary committee which passed the sections cracking down on illegal aliens and will now debate legal immigration separately the house voted thursday to strip most provisions on legal immigration and passed a bill aimed at cutting down the influx of illegal immigrants and making it harder for them to get jobs and government benefits the clinton administration supported the jordan commission and says it still wants to see legal immigration reform but it swung its support at the last minute behind an amendment to strip the house bill of its reductions in the levels of family and employmentbased legal immigration a move that the bills sponsors denounced as an electionyear stab in the back the irrefutable conclusion is that they did it simply because of the politics said rep john bryant dtex a cosponsor of the house bill they believe that by appearing to act boldly on illegal immigration they satisfy that voter desire and by punting on legal immigration they will not make any ethnic or business groups mad at them now bryant said any significant legal immigration reform is dead and that means continued dramatic increases in americas foreignborn population since annual legal immigration is about three times higher than illegal immigration one of bryants chief concerns is the effect of immigration on population growth the census bureau estimates that the us population currently about 263 million will reach at least 400 million by 2050 and may rise to 500 million if current trends continue the census bureau attributes onethird of us population growth to immigration both legal and illegal but some demographers say the percentage is higher rep lamar smith rtex the house bills chief sponsor holds out hope that reform of legal immigration can be taken up another day perhaps another year although polls show that more than 80 percent of americans want lower immigration he said its awfully easy for special interests to target particular members of congress on the other hand asserts immigration advocate frank sharry those special interests represent a wide cross section of society thursdays vote was a bipartisan repudiation of deep cuts in legal immigration he said it means that if there is going to be legal immigration reform this year it is going to be on the terms of those who embrace legal immigration as a good thing his main criticism of the bill is that it was ambushed by an amendment promoted in a rare floor speech by house speaker newt gingrich rga that gives states the option to deny free public education to illegal immigrant children it is a provision that white house press secretary michael mccurry has labeled nutty and that may trigger a veto if a bill containing it reaches president clintons desk and that some cynics believe may have been the point its quite clear that once again gingrich could not resist the red meat of political opportunity and decided to politicize the bill for the fall elections said bryant the idea would be to allow republicans to portray themselves as tougher than clinton on illegal immigration especially in such key states as california i fear for the future of this debate and the future of politics said daniel stein head of the federation for american immigration reform which advocates deep cuts in legal immigration the house bill he charged is a shell of reform in large part because republicans were unwilling to provide the basic tools to enforce immigration law he cited the defeat of a mandatory verification system by which employers could check the employment eligibility of jobseekers and the rejection of a secure social security card on the senate side he noted legislators spurned tougher sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and all but buried

717 of 997 documents the washington post march 22 1996 friday final edition house passes major immigration bill without reducing legal limits william branigin john e yang washington post staff writers section a section pg a10 length 844 words the house yesterday approved a major immigration bill after stripping it of provisions aimed at reducing the influx of legal immigrants the final vote of 333 to 87 came after the clinton administration threw its support behind a move to limit the legislation essentially to a crackdown on illegal immigration the bill beefs up the border patrol streamlines deportation procedures toughens penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud and makes it more difficult for illegal aliens to receive education and welfare benefits earlier a vote on a key amendment which passed 238 to 183 deleted sections that would have reduced levels of legal immigration from about 775000 a year at present to about 700000 annually for the first five years and fewer than 600000 a year after that the bill originally conceived as the most ambitious effort to overhaul us immigration laws in 30 years addressed an issue that has sparked hot political rhetoric on the campaign trail in this election season and that promises to figure in both parties attempts to woo electoral voterich california deleting the provisions on legal immigration removed the most contentious parts of the bill and brought it more closely into line with a senate version now before its judiciary committee by shifting their focus to a crackdown on illegal aliens the representatives seized an issue on which there is broad agreement but did little to lower the overall influx of immigrants most of whom come to the united states legally voting on other amendments the house rejected efforts by powerful agricultural interests to insert a new guestworker program into the bill one defeated amendment would have allowed admission of up to 250000 agricultural guest workers a year and another would have let in up to 100000 a year the clinton administrations support for the amendment to strip the bill surprised its chief sponsors texans lamar s smith r and john bryant d clinton had previously expressed support for the recommendations of the bipartisan commission on immigration reform which had called for significant cuts in legal immigration and upon which portions of the house bill were based we were able to keep our promise and produce a bipartisan bill that is truly in the national interest smith said he said that losing the legal reform provisions was clearly a disappointment but that the issue is unlikely to die i dont think the administration appreciates the strong feelings of americans on immigration reform he said the vote was immediately hailed by members of an eclectic proimmigration coalition that united business labor ethnic religious liberal conservative and libertarian groups it was bitterly denounced by advocates of lower immigration levels who charged that the bill had been gutted by special interests supporters of the amendment sponsored by an unlikely alliance of two conservative republican freshmen and a veteran liberal democrat portrayed the bills effort to reduce legal immigration as unfair rep dick chrysler rmich one of the sponsors said the bill was closing the door on families of us citizens he added i cannot justify voting for the drastic cuts in legal immigration because of problems in illegal immigration it is fundamentally wrong to take the justifiable anger about our failure to deal with the issue of illegal immigration and piggyback on top of that anger a drastic cut in permanent legal immigration a cause and a force that has been good for this country said rep howard l berman dcalif another sponsor we are a nation of immigrants said rep sam brownback rkan the third cosponsor congress should preserve that proud tradition not threaten it opponents argued that the two issues of legal and illegal immigration could not be separated a fundamental problem in our current immigration system is that more than 80 percent of all legal immigrants are now admitted without reference to their skills and education and 37 percent lack even a high school education smith said this surplus of unskilled immigrants hurts those americans who can least afford it those at the lowest end of the economic ladder youve got to deal with legal immigration thats where the numbers are said bryant illegal immigration is estimated to add 300000 to 400000 people to the us population each year while the number of legal immigrants and refugees has exceeded 1 million in some recent years bryant on wednesday expressed great disappointment and contempt for the white houses surprise decision to support stripping the legal immigration provisions from the bill calling it a politically cowardly reversal of a yearold position it is a simple case of caving in to political pressure he said administration officials said they still support modest reform of legal immigration and hope to include measures to protect us workers in any new bill on that issue loaddate march 22 1996 language

telling his clients about the immigration reforms pending in congress im not the type of person to terrorize my clients with every little thing that congress proposes esparza said from his office in austin texas terrorizing they may be little theyre not the immigration reform bills headed for a vote this week in the house and next month in the senate would make the most wideranging changes in federal immigration law in decades they could add thousands of border patrol agents to the beat deny admission to political refugees who cannot prove their persecution claims within hours of arriving and knock one of esparzas clients off an immigration waiting list hes been on for 12 years the bills could also include the first cuts in the number of foreigners entering the country legally since the 1920s and restrict immigrants access to some social services the breadth of the bills with their mix of fixes for legal and illegal immigration could doom them in both houses of congress the senate judiciary committee voted thursday to split the senate version into two parts one each dealing with legal and illegal immigration amendments in both of those areas added and subtracted large pieces of wouldbe law the lead sponsor of the house bill rep lamar smith rtexas is calm about his bills prospects in the face of the coming storm of colleagues amendments itll pass he said mostly intact as it stands smiths bill encompasses enough changes to immigration law to make a lot of people unhappy proimmigration groups are appalled at the proposed 30 percent reduction in the number of family members who could join legal immigrants in the united states human rights groups object to the proposed 50 percent cut in refugee admissions business groups particularly those representing the hightech industry are peeved at the idea of a slight reduction in the number of immigrants who could be admitted for specific jobs smith is happy just to get his bill on the table for eight years he toiled in the house minority party when the republicans won control a little more than a year ago smith won a promotion to chairman of the house immigration subcommittee a position that let him draft and direct a reform program he thought was long overdue he said his constituents feel the same way the one issue i get the most applause on the most questions about is immigration he said very few issues elicit such strong responses why do smiths constituents feel so strongly i think they see every day in their lives the manifest effects of a broken immigration system he said whether its bulging schools or crowded emergency rooms maybe its crime people see it they feel it theyre impacted smiths bill would cut federal reimbursement to hospitals for emergency medical care of illegal immigrants thus requiring the hospitals to verify a patients immigration status but it doesnt address public schools open to immigrant children through grade 12 regardless of legal status and the crime that concerns his constituents is only glancingly addressed in provisions dealing with terrorists and requiring quick deportations of illegalalien criminals after serving prison sentences smith is aware of the bills shortcomings you dont always get a whole loaf he said with a smile and a shrug the demographics of immigration dramatically raise the political stakes of this debate in a presidential election year fueling much of this debate are two questions do immigrants displace americans in the job market and do immigrants receive more in public assistance than us citizens some studies suggest that although immigrants may not take away jobs in fact in many cases they create new ones they reduce the prospects for lowerskilled workers in weak local economies the welfare question is just as muddied each side uses definitions of public assistance and census information that supports its point the urban institute a nonpartisan research organization says that 95 percent of immigrants do not receive welfare but george borjas a professor of public policy at harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government says that 21 percent of immigrant households receive some type of public assistance compared with 14 percent of native households more than 70 percent of the nations legal and illegal immigrants live in six large voterrich states a california texas florida new york new jersey and illinois a where many officials are worried that immigrants unduly burden local services in california for example immigrants make up 21 percent of all households but receive 40 percent of public assistance such as medicaid food stamps and housing subsidies but some republican strategists fear the immigration bills could backfire by angering vast numbers of potential voters who are sponsoring nearly 2 million family members on waiting lists in visa categories that could be eliminated the political drama is set against the nations largest influx of immigrants since the turn of the century nearly 10 million immigrants have taken up residence in the united states legally in the past 10 years including 3 million illegal aliens who were given amnesty under the 1986 immigration reform and control act as lawmakers debate these arguments there has been intense pressure and maneuvering from special interest groups including an unlikely alliance of high technology companies grassroots immigrant groups and civil liberties organizations opposed to the congressional proposals smith amended one section of his bill to make it more palatable to business he had originally proposed a mandatory pilot program requiring employers in five states to verify with the immigration and naturalization service that job applicants are citizens or legal immigrants his amendment would make the verification program voluntary available nationwide sen alan simpson rwyo scrapped a section of his bill that would have severely restricted us companies hiring of temporary immigrant workers by setting higher salaries and imposing annual fees of 10000 or more per foreign worker he said business groups distortions of its intent were distracting other senators from considering the whole bill simpson had thought that removing the foreignworker restrictions would end the business groups push to divide the senate bill into separate measures dealing with legal and illegal immigration he was proved wrong thursday with the immigration subcommittees vote to do just that the strength of the argument for splitting the bill is evident in the reaction of the two republican senators from texas that state has the thirdlargest population of illegal immigrants among the 50 states with about 10 percent of the estimated total of 35 million to 4 million illegal immigrants nationwide as a consequence texas republican sens kay bailey hutchison and phil gramm want to see congress do something about illegal immigration before it even thinks about legal immigration we should focus on illegal immigration first hutchison said that is what is costing our state and our country so much hutchisons proposal to require fingerprinting of all illegal immigrants caught by the border patrol has been added to the senate bill and shes pushing for a 10year ban on any immigrant who once entered the united states illegally gramm wants to encourage legal

washington a senate panel voted yesterday to split up a major immigration bill an action that may doom efforts to cut legal immigration while propelling legislation to prevent illegal immigration immigration proponents hailed the bipartisan 126 vote of the judiciary committee as a turning point in a hot immigration debate touched off by californias proposition 187 in 1994 and fanned this year with republican attacks proponents of tough immigration controls sought a bill that covered legal as well as illegal immigration they figured that widely popular steps to fight illegal entrants would boost lesspalatable measures against legal immigration sen alan k simpson r wyo the immigration subcommittee chairman opposed splitting the bill his proposal would cut legal immigration now at an annual level of about 775000 by 20 percent it would allow us citizens to have their spouses and minor children join them in the united states but it would eliminate immigration options for siblings and most adult children and would severely curtail immigration by parents the measure covering illegal immigration would sharply increase funding for border patrol agents it also would establish a pilot computerized program to check the eligibility of people applying for jobs or public benefits and it would make it easier to deny entry to foreigners who seek us asylum but do not hold proper documents advocates on both sides agreed that the vote makes it difficult but hardly impossible for some legal immigration reforms to win approval this year a parallel bill is scheduled for debate next week in the house where a previously defeated drive to split the bill will be revived product liability house republicans have dropped their demand for a sweeping rewrite of civil litigation laws clearing the way for a compromise that would limit damages only in faultyproduct cases senate moderates prevailed wednesday in limiting a bill aimed at dampening the incentive for americans to sue under the compromise drafted by senate and house negotiators ceilings on damages would be imposed only in defectiveproduct cases the much broader gop contract with america package passed by the house last year would have limited punitive damage awards in all civil lawsuits including medical malpractice cases the compromise closely tracks a narrower senate measure that passed by 6137 in may judges could override the statutory limits on punitive damages designed to punish wrongdoing but defendants in those cases also would get automatic rights to a new trial juries hearing faultyproducts cases could grant a maximum punitive damage award of twice a claimants compensatory damages economic losses and pain and suffering payments or 250000 whichever is larger it wasnt immediately clear whether president clinton would sign the compromise which the senate could vote on next week clinton had threatened to veto the broader version that was pushed by senate majority leader bob dole whitewater probe senate democrats and republicans squared off yesterday over a gop threat to move the whitewater investigation to a new forum republicans failed for a third straight day to end the impasse holding up the inquiry sen alfonse m damato r ny said wednesday that if the senate whitewater committees authority which expired last month was not extended the investigation would be moved to the banking committee damato heads both panels but senate minority leader tom daschle d sd said the transfer is prohibited by the law that established the whitewater committee last spring senate parliamentarian bob dove disagreed dove said that since the banking committee previously held hearings on whitewater which fell within its jurisdiction it could legally do so again as they had on tuesday and wednesday the republicans fell short of the 60 votes they needed to end debate getting 51 fortysix of the chambers 47 democrats voted no with one absent welfare reform a highprofile bipartisan effort by the nations governors to break the deadlock between congress and president clinton on welfare and medicaid reform all but collapsed yesterday the turn of events apparently sets the stage for the gop majority in congress to push through a bill to reform welfare and medicaid without much democratic support the measure would then almost certainly draw a presidential veto and become a campaign issue the breakdown emerged in a bit of political theater that began with a morning news conference led by house speaker newt gingrich r ga at which a bevy of republican governors announced that their democratic counterparts had agreed to a detailed plan to revamp medicaid and welfare they said such a bill would be ready for house and senate action within two weeks but the announcement was disavowed by the three democratic governors involved in the marathon negotiations the three had not been told of the allgop news conference democratic govs bob miller of nevada roy romer of colorado and lawton chiles of florida said in a joint statement that the announcement was unfortunate and extremely premature considerable work remains on the proposal the statement said and it noted that there had been no discussion of much less agreement on linking welfare reform to medicaid reform lineitem veto congressional negotiators said yesterday that they had reached agreement on a compromise aimed at ending a yearlong impasse over a republican bill to give the president greater power to eliminate specific spending programs approved by congress sens john mccain r ariz and daniel r coats r ind leading proponents of the lineitem veto said they expected a housesenate conference to adopt the plan next week the measure part of the gop contract with america and supported by president clinton and past presidents allows the president to eliminate individual items in larger spending bills currently the president can only veto a spending bill in its entirety and cannot target specific programs for elimination the bill sailed through the house in february 1995 and then emerged from the senate a month later in very different form following objections that the house version was an unconstitutional giveaway of congressional authority the compromise reached yesterday basically accepts the house version the president singles out items for veto and returns them to congress which has 30 days to decide which items it wants to restore a twothirds vote is needed to overturn the presidential veto loaddate october 28 2002 language english copyright 1996 philadelphia

reunification programs suffered a significant setback in the senate on thursday the senate judiciary committee voted overwhelmingly to separate the sweeping bordercontrol bill into two measures one with politically popular measures aimed at punishing those who crash americas borders and one with more controversial limits on lawful entry into the us the action will allow senators to vote for the politically safe illegal immigration measures while opposing the reductions in legal immigration making it more likely that the yearlong drive to enact reform will be confined to illegal immigration the progress of the combined bill has been watched closely in the ethnically diverse silicon valley particularly in the filipino community the secondlargest in the nation if the measures in the legal immigrant bill become law 93 percent of the hundreds of thousands of filipinos waiting to immigrate many of them relatives of filipinos already here would become ineligible immigration proponents hailed thursdays vote as a turning point in a whitehot immigration debate that was touched off by californias proposition 187 in 1994 and fanned this year along the republican campaign trail where tough talk on immigration has been anything but subtle this is a dramatic setback for them said frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum a proimmigration group a year ago it looked like measures to cut legal immigration by about onethird were politically inevitable this vote shows there is tremendous and growing opposition to cutting legal immigration the senate panels vote to split the bill was 126 and reflected the issues unusual political alliances judiciary committee chairman orrin g hatch rutah supported it along with sen edward m kennedy dmass and many democrats sen alan k simpson rwy the immigration subcommittee chairman opposed it as did sen dianne feinstein dcalif feinstein who has voted for tough measures to stem immigration that she says threatens to overwhelm california said the legal immigration proposals have been politically sensitive every immigration attorney has organized all their clients and theyre all lobbying she said so its tough but the bottom line of this is what is just and fair in a country that accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world and most of them put together feinstein said without the cover of popular measures to combat illegal immigration efforts to curb legal immigration and perhaps any immigration bill at all will be a difficult sell this year it just makes it much more speculative as to whether any kind of bill can come out in the long term feinstein said simpson vows to fight but simpson indicated he will continue the fight for measures covering both illegal and legal immigration he said the legal immigration measure will be given full debate on the senate floor where he is likely to move to meld the measures back into a single bill and advocates on both sides of the issue agreed that while thursdays vote makes it more difficult for some legal immigration changes to win approval this year the task is not impossible the issue will not go away simpson told reporters after the vote it will not collapse into the basement the president wants to deal with it bob dole wants to deal with it and everybody in america wants to deal with it a parallel bill is moving forward in the house which is scheduled to debate it next week where a previously defeated effort to split the bill will be revived dan stein executive director of the federation for american immigration reform which favors tougher immigration laws said the senate committee caved in to special interests who seek to protect a system he said was out of control he called the vote cowardly obedience to them betrayed our trust the move to split the bill should be seen for what it is a transparent effort to kill muchneeded and widely supported cuts in the current flood of legal immigration stein said by shirking their responsibility to the american public to reform immigration these shallow representatives have betrayed our trust dismissed the wishes of their constituents and worsened the growing problem of overimmigration but cecilia munoz a deputy vice president of the national council of la raza a hispanic civil rights group said separate examinations of the two immigration bills will expose the flaws in proposals to tighten legal immigration it makes no sense to deny american citizens the right to live with their spouses their kids and their siblings munoz said simpsons proposal would cut legal immigration now at an annual level of about 775000 by 20 percent it would allow us citizens to have their spouses and minor children join them in the us but it would eliminate immigration options for siblings and most adult children and would severely curtail immigration by parents those aspects of the measure have caused particular concern in this area for example of the 70000 unmarried adult sons and daughters of us citizens on the waiting list to enter the country 50000 are filipino of 260000 married sons and daughters on the list 150000 are filipino illegals debated first hatch said his committee will debate the legal immigration bill one week after it completes work on the illegal immigration measure with debate on the senate floor scheduled for late april all the stuff you heard here will come rising like the phoenix out of the ashes on the floor simpson said last year a commission headed by the late barbara jordan a former texas congresswoman called for cuts in illegal immigration and president clinton swiftly embraced that recommendation since then his administration has sent mixed signals about the pace and details of immigration reform the illegal immigration bill would dramatically increase funding for borderpatrol agents it would establish an experimental computerized program to check the eligibility status of people applying for jobs or public benefits and it would make it easier to deny entry to foreigners who seek us asylum but do not hold proper documents loaddate october 23 2002 language english

presidential primary hell have his pick of gettough remedies republican candidates have been talking about immigration with a forcefulness that resonates even here hundreds of miles from americas porous borderlands but border politics arent likely to reach full boil until later this month when the candidates reach california where the heated debate promises to echo in novembers general election and in congress as lawmakers consider the most restrictive immigration policies in 30 years though frontrunning bob dole is expected in todays contests to make his nomination all but a formality analysts say immigration will be amplified as a campaign issue by the renegade candidacy of pat buchanan buchanans fence the cabletv pundit wants to build a fence at the usmexico border to halt illegal immigration and shut down most legal immigration for five years he has tied the issue to concerns about free trade declining wages crime and a decline in social values buchanan is going

university doles need to assuage buchanans supporters experts say may have dramatic impact on what he does as both the gop nominee and as majority leader in the senate where he will have to give his blessing to the immigration bill republicans hope to pass the pending legislation would establish a pilot verification system in states with many immigrants such as california that would allow employers to check the legal residency status of potential workers opponents say that is a first step toward a national identification card the legislation also would curb the ability of us residents

appearing slightly more moderate than those who want to dig ditches at the border and erect fences that is going to be counterproductive said robert rubin of the lawyers committee for civil rights of

tame by comparison here in texas where trade with mexico was a 24 billion business in 1994 immigration resonates only in pockets along the border where immigrants are overwhelming schools and in the fields of the flagging oil business where economic anxiety has taken over richard estrada a member of the us commission on immigration reform which has called for reductions in the number of legal immigrants and crackdowns on illegal immigration said texas longstanding ties to mexico help distinguish it from the wrenching debate in california still we have reached a saturation point in places like el paso where they have had to raise property taxes to deal with immigration and people are resentful about it said estrada a dallas newspaperman throbbing migraine if that resentment is an isolated ache in texas it is a throbbing migraine in california where gov pete wilson used illegal immigration to propel himself to a second term in 1994 voters that year also overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative he championed proposition 187 which would cut off public education social services and nonemergency health benefits to illegal immigrants wilson doles california chairman continues to press the immigration issue suing the federal government to pay the costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants who break the law in california beating up on latinos is good politics said frank sharry executive director of national immigration forum a proimmigration group i dont think immigration is going to be a big national issue this year but its going to be a big issue in regions that cannot be ignored and that means california that means president clinton is expected to continue to trumpet his moves to dramatically increase patrols at the border while doubling the immigration and naturalization services budget it means dole who has called for a modest temporary reduction in legal immigration and the elimination of services to illegal immigrants is expected to trumpet his endorsement of proposition 187 and it means buchanan who has warned illegals are coming by the millions will be in fullthroated battle cry as his insurgent campaign moves west support in california the architects of prop 187 most of which has been invalidated in court say support for buchanans message is powerful in california pat buchanan is not simply a little flea on the backside of an elephant said bill ong hing an immigration law expert at stanford and founder and director of the immigrant legal resource center in san francisco and east palo alto he has a lot more credibility on this issue in california than elsewhere if pat buchanan wasnt going to be in california maybe dole wouldnt have to talk about immigration but now he has to some republicans worry buchanans california campaign will have the effect of frustrating legitimate efforts to control legal and illegal immigration if pat buchanan gets to these issues in california before bob dole does he defines the terms of the debate and its no longer a debate between illegal immigration and legal immigration said dan schnur a republican strategist and former wilson aide it becomes a debate about the cultural

new branch of the armed forces malcolm s steve forbes welcomes legal immigrants as good for america and business robert j dole hails the us heritage as a nation of immigrants but adds that there are limits dueling sound bites from candidates for the republican presidential nomination have put immigration at the forefront of this years presidential campaign the bursts of rhetoric on the subject leave many unanswered questions but they have helped to crystallize the serious divisions on immigration that exist within the republican party these divisions are about to come to a head in congress where both the senate and house are set to debate legislation aimed at cutting back on legal immigration as well as cracking down on illegal entries the first battleground is the senate judiciary committee where influential republicans have joined forces with a motley coalition of business labor religious ethnic and proimmigration groups to attack a major immigration reform bill sponsored by sen alan k simpson rwyo a retiring party elder who seeks to make the legislation his swan song the opponents want to split the bill shelving the sections dealing with legal immigration and focusing only on illegal immigration the committee is to take up the measure today in march the full house is scheduled to consider an omnibus immigration reform bill sponsored by rep lamar smith rtex while smith is confident that he can beat back attempts to split his bill in similar fashion key republicans including house majority leader richard k armey tex have expressed reservations about restricting legal immigration and other elements of the package notably steps toward establishment of a national employment verification system to check the identities of jobseekers immigration is a highstakes issue for the republican party and divisions over it may have serious political consequences this election year said frank sharry director of the national immigration forum which supports legal immigration although there is broad support for curtailing illegal immigration measures against legal immigrants he said risk offending many new voters including hispanics and asian americans in california texas florida illinois new york and other states rich in electoral votes these voters are politically up for grabs sharry said if the republicans are going to alienate the fastestgrowing groups of new voters its hard to imagine them sustaining their majority through the next election the prospect clearly worries influential republicans such as former education secretary william j bennett and former housing secretary jack kemp in a news conference yesterday they issued a study extolling the benefits of legal immigration in an effort to correct what they described as distortions in the presidential campaign and in congress leading the antiimmigration charge on the campaign trail has been buchanan who promises to build a security fence along the usmexican border and defend it with troops if necessary he also advocates a fiveyear moratorium on legal immigration to give america time to absorb the flood of immigrants in recent years at times his critics say buchanans rhetoric has seemed tinged with xenophobia listen jose youre not coming in this time he shouted at one recent rally during his 1992 campaign for president he complained of having to walk past these guys sitting on the corner playing bongo drums in his own home town washington dc behind the applause lines however details of buchanans plans seem to be in short supply at times he has spoken of erecting a double chainlinked security fence along 250 miles of border and at other times the distance has been 60 or 70 miles precisely where along the 2000mile border this fence would go up and how much it would cost remain open questions according to the immigration and naturalization service there is already a total of 316 miles of fencing along the border including 44 miles of reinforced fences made of surplus iron runway mats in the most heavily traversed areas then there is the problem of using troops to repel illegal aliens which immigration experts say would violate longstanding legal constraints on using the military for domestic law enforcement purposes neither buchanan nor alexander has clarified this point and alexander has at times reacted testily when asked how much his proposal to create a new branch of the armed forces to deal with illegal immigration and drug trafficking would cost its not a serious proposal said dan stein head of the antiimmigration group federation for american immigration reform forbes meanwhile reflects a libertarian probusiness view of immigration arguing that legal immigrants help america to maintain its hightech edge in the global economy he derides the idea of creating a new branch of the armed forces as the typical problemsolving approach of a lifetime politician for his part forbes says he wants to reform the ins and streamline deportation procedures like his opponents however he provides no details of what he has in mind dole has called immigration a big issue in 96 but has avoided taking firm stands so far on

of florida pg 1a length 1135 words survey after survey plainly shows it american voters are preoccupied with immigration sometimes intensely so but in a presidential campaign in which partisan lines have been sharply  drawn over welfare and the budget the subject of immigration has yet to  provoke muchof a stir with the notable exception of pat buchanan for  instance the major republican challengers have been content to voice  approving soundbites about legal immigration while uniformly condemning  illegal entry a year after inspiring the proposition 187 movement in california to deny public services to undocumented aliens though illegal immigration is less  and less the issue at least in presidential politics everyone is against it  even many of the most ardent defenders of immigration leaving little room for argument it may simply be too early the campaign after all has yet to move full  force into the states where immigration really matters like california and  florida there may be a deeper reason though when it comes to immigration there  is no simple liberalconservative divide its a democratic president bill  clinton who can lay claim to actually cracking down on illegals and who has  endorsed a proposal to reduce the levels of legal immigration by as much as a  third only buchanan has gone further he calls for a fiveyear moratorium on most legal immigration while other republican candidates including sens bob dole and phil gramm have pointedly refused to follow his lead to a man they defend legal immigrants as an asset a wellspring of economic vigor for the country meanwhile it is publishing heir steve forbes who has directly attacked the clintonbacked proposal to scale back legal immigration as misguided with pro and antiimmigration sentiment crossing party lines some  political observers say there is little partisan advantage in attacking legal  newcomers for republican candidates and potentially much to lose this issue is not really a winner for most republicans said frank  sharry executive director of the national immigration forum a  proimmigration lobbying group you have many traditional conservatives who  are very pro immigration if youre a candidate who wants to win the  republican nomination you have to be very careful you could lose cubans in  miami asians in california 20 different ethnic groups in new york and some  very conservative mexicanamericans in texas a voices of florida poll last fall found that an overwhelming majority of registered florida voters even hispanic and foreignborn residents consider immigration to be a problem the poll revealed that a majority of voters favor tough measures to crack down on illegal immigration by denying access to  public services such as health care and education voices of florida is a coalition of six newspapers 11 television stations  and public radio including the times the miami herald wtspch 10 and  wusffm 897 the news organizations joined forces to explore which issues are  most important to voters in florida in south florida where cubanamericans remain pivotal to the gop dole  gramm and lamar alexander have found themselves treading very cautiously  around the immigration issue avoiding talk about making english the nations  official language sealing the borders and declaring the american culture  superior to all others the gap between buchanan and the others reflects deep divisions over immigration in the republican party like dole gramm forbes and alexander the partys traditional probusiness and libertarian wings see the growth that immigration produces as good for the economy they also regard some proposals to control immigration including national  id cards and a tax on businesses that import workers as intrusive big government gramm and dole have taken firm stands on one issue they have backed bills  that would end or restrict immigrants use of certain government benefits  including welfare and social security but their other forays into immigrationrelated issues have been careful  even tentative in a highly publicized speech to the american legion last  year dole called for english to be made the countrys official language and  blasted bilingual education then seemed to quickly abandon that course alexanders main proposal has been to strip control of the countrys  borders from the immigration and naturalization service and turn it over to  the military or a private contractor the former tennessee governor said the  agency is incapable of controlling illegal border crossings at the same time  that it oversees legal immigration those moderate stands could clash with the hardline position of many in the republican rankandfile in both houses of congress republicans have introduced bills that would  scale back legal immigration from the present level of about 900000 a year  some drastically they would do so by varying methods most legal immigrants are relatives of naturalized citizens or permanent us residents some proposals would bar parents siblings and adult children of immigrants from joining them or place a strict cap on their numbers for instance buchanan has backed a bill that would freeze all immigration for five  years with the exception of spouses and minor children of us citizens the idea he says is to keep the millions of recent arrivals from  overwhelming the country culturally and economically giving them time to  learn english get on their feet economically and join the american  mainstream weve got to become one country again buchanan has said at least two bills are expected to make it out of committee this spring as they come up for debate and as the presidential campaigns move into florida california and texas immigration could again catch fire and the candidates could be forced to show their hands alexander forbes and gramm have criticized the bills directly or  indirectly but none has given specifics about how he would deal with legal  immigration in columns in his business magazine forbes has suggested that  present levels suit him fine gramm has left the door open to some restrictions we are here setting up arbitrary limits that prevent people who came here legally who have been successful who have achieved the american dream from bringing their kinfolk to america he said recently i do not think that  is right i do not think it makes any sense yet he added on another occasion i think we ought to put a premium on  people who can bring new skills new energy but im not ready to tear down  the statue of liberty loaddate

byline martin espinoza the press democrat santa rosa calif section state and regional news length 775 words oct 05gov jerry brown signed a slate of immigrationrelated bills saturday including the trust act which limits local law enforcement agencies use of federal holds on undocumented immigrants booked into local jails the bill ab 4 by assemblyman tom ammiano dsan francisco prohibits local police agencies from holding individuals on federal immigration detainers unless they are charged with or convicted of a serious felony or certain misdemeanors or if they are registered sex offenders it creates a statewide standard for how local agencies comply with the federal secure communities program soon immigrant californians and their family members will have the confidence that minor or unjustified arrests for things like selling food without a permit or having dogs that bark too loudly will not lead to extended and costly detentions in our local jails for deportation purposes said reshma shamasunder executive director of the california immigrant policy center brown vetoed a similar bill a year ago but this years bill was amended to increase the list of crimes that would keep immigrants in jail until federal immigration officials could take custody immigration advocates have long argued that immigration holds used in conjunction with the federal secure communities program often ensnare us citizens legal immigrants and undocumented immigrants jailed for minor offenses or charges that later are dropped its incredible when the rest of the country is falling behind on immigration reform california is taking the lead said jesus guzman a local immigration advocate who first heard the news on twitter sonoma county sheriff steve freitas has been a staunch opponent of the bill freitas said that if signed into law the bill would force him to choose between violating the new state law or federal rules which require local law enforcement officials to honor immigration detainers last year freitas told local supporters of the bill that he would challenge the new law in court but in early september freitas said publicly that while he still opposes the bill he would not spend county resources fighting it in court representatives from us immigration and customs enforcement were unavailable to comment saturday because of the federal government shutdown according to a voicemail greeting at the agency the bill was part of package of immigrationrelated bills that brown signed saturday in what appeared to be a sympathetic move supporting immigration advocates call for congress to adopt a comprehensive bill that would deal fairly with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the united states last week brown signed a bill that would require the department of motor vehicles to issue special drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants reversing a 20year old law that has landed many undocumented immigrants in jail for driving infractions while washington waffles on immigration californias forging ahead governor brown said im not waiting aside from the trust act the governor signed the following immigrationrelated bills saturday ab 35 which orders that immigration consultants attorneys notaries public and organizations accredited by the united states board of immigration appeals are the only people who can charge a fee for providing services associated with filing an application under the us department of homeland securitys deferred action program ab 524 which defines as extortion any threat of reporting the immigration status or suspected immigration status of an individual or the individuals family in an effort to induce fear ab 1024 which allows undocumented immigrants who have graduated from law school and passed the state

antiimmigration group finds that us cities with a high percentage of immigrants have a poorer quality of life than cities with a low percentage the study out today by the federation for american immigration reform is provoking inflamed arguments about immigration and the issue is likely to become even hotter early next year when congress takes up legislation that would sharply curtail immigration for the first time in decades advocates for immigrants say they hope to derail the bills or significantly weaken them those in favor of restricting immigration say they believe the current high level of immigration is bad for the nation their report a tale of ten cities compares 197090 census bureau data on five pairs of cities of similar size in each pair one city has a high percentage

institute a liberal think tank says bouvier compared busy port cities to inland cities and recessionwracked california cities to heartland cities those differences could affect quality of life even more than immigration he says by not taking into account anything but population he stacks the deck in a way that doesnt make analytic sense says fix dowell myers an urban planner at the university of southern california and an expert on qualityoflife research says bouviers choice of cities amounts to comparing apples to watermelons dan stein director of the federation for american immigration

branigin washington post staff writer section a section pg a08 length 890 words sen alan k simpson rwyo introduced a bill yesterday to overhaul the nations legal immigration system by sharply reducing annual admissions of familysponsored immigrants and imposing new restrictions on those who come to the united states for employment citing a need for a breathing space in the annual growth of legal immigration simpson said his bill would curtail the chain migration of immigrants extended families and protect us workers and new college graduates from unfair competition by foreigners who often accept lower wages the proposed legislation would lower nonrefugee admissions by about 25 percent to 540000 a year including 90000 employmentrelated immigrants and 450000 familysponsored immigrants in a major change certain to encounter stiff opposition from us businesses the bill would also effectively bar companies from hiring foreign students immediately upon graduation from american universities the bill is the last major piece of a series of gop legislative initiatives aimed at reducing both legal and illegal immigration while there is a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to fight illegal immigration measures to pare down family and employmentbased legal admissions have aroused intense controversy in both parties and are expected to become a hot political issue in the 1996 election year a broad immigration bill that passed the house judiciary committee last month has sharply split republicans creating some strange political bedfellows on key issues and foreshadowing a potentially divisive debate when the bill reaches the house floor probably next year the house bill introduced by rep lamar smith rtex and passed 23 to 10 by the judiciary committee on oct 24 already is coming under attack from an unlikely alliance of conservative republicans liberal democrats immigration advocates and elements of the business community they want to split the bill allowing provisions on illegal immigration to go forward while shelving the sections on legal immigration in introducing his longawaited bill on the senate floor yesterday simpson who chairs the senate subcommittee on immigration said americans are growing increasingly restless and dissatisfied with annual levels of immigration that are more than five times higher than they were in 1953

assimilating well the extraordinary level of immigration the country has been experiencing in recent years simpson indicated he wants to combine the new bill with a pending one on illegal immigration before presenting the package to the full senate judiciary committee this year he said his bill would limit familybased immigration to the spouses and unmarried minor children of us citizens with some exceptions for parents and would cap visas allotted to spouses and unmarried minor children of lawful permanent aliens at 85000 a year in addition 150000 of the 450000 annual familysponsored immigrant visas would go toward reducing a backlog of more than 11 million spouses and minor children of permanent residents whose petitions have been approved the bill does not deal with refugees of whom 90000 can be admitted next year some of the bills most controversial provisions call for capping employmentbased permanent immigration at 90000 a year down from 140000 at present and requiring employers to pay a fee equal to 30 percent of the immigrant workers annual salary into a fund to finance the training of american workers additional provisions are aimed at discouraging the use of temporary foreign workers to replace americans foreign students who graduate from us universities would have to work outside the united states for two to five years depending on their education level and desired immigration status before they could come back as employmentbased temporary or permanent immigrants in the house 10 california republicans signed a letter urging the bill be split to avoid

certain to change as it winds its way through congress and lands on president clintons desk probably sometime next year this much is clear america is poised to yank in its welcome mat for illegal and

736 of 997 documents the washington post october 15 1995 sunday final edition the case for meanspiritedness emotions aside restricting immigration is in the national interest peter brimelow section outlook pg c04 length 1234 words the immigration issue is on the move at last future historians will wonder what took it so long we are transforming ourselves immigration and naturalization service commissioner doris meissner has said approvingly but no one bothered to consult we this fall however bills authored by both sen alan simpson rwyo and rep lamar smith rtex mark an historic watershed both propose the first reduction in the legal influx since the 1965 immigration act restarted mass immigration quite accidentally after the fourdecade midcentury lull official washington is used to being told that it is out of touch with the rest of the country but on the immigration issue professional politicians are showing a touching bipartisan willingness to get it even president clinton initially endorsed the findings of the recent us commission on immigration reform headed by former liberal congresswoman barbara jordan which concluded in effect that the system was broke and that legal immigration should be reduced the problem is what might be called the political intelligentsia reporters and media commentators assorted policy wonks and ideologues in foundations and universities by continuing to bang the drum for the glories of immigration in principle rather than facing the anomalies of immigration in practice this powerful group can intimidate the professional politicians and ensure that the national debate in key respects remains paralyzed by emotion combined with the usual ethnic and specialinterest lobbying this means theres still a significant chance that real immigration reform will not in the end be passed by this congress the marks of this paralysis can already be seen in the current proposals both the bills and the jordan commission have considerable difficulty in figuring out a practical way to reduce the legal immigration numbers in 1994 there were about 800000 legal immigrants not counting 150000 asylum applicants most of whom will never leave major portions of the current influx reunification of close family members and refugees have been assumed to be sacrosanct for years any discussion of reducing legal immigration was smothered with the blanket accusation of racism because the 1965 act had effectively choked off europe and skewed admissions to a handful of countries in the third world now that this restriction is finally being debated any effort to make it substantive is met with another accusation meanspiritedness who after all could possibly be against reuniting families one result is that current proposals are forced to freeze or cut the already small skilled immigration category which constitutes about 15 percent of legal immigration but this is the only type of immigration that can be shown to be of economic benefit to the american nativeborn in a recent article in the journal of economic perspectives prof george j borjas of the university of california san diego estimated the benefit to nativeborn americans from the presence of nearly 20 million immigrants is nugatory maybe onetenth of one percent of gdp because the influx has been so unskilled and threatening skilled immigration is bound to galvanize blind business opposition to any reform herewith some meanspirited thoughts why should the policy of close family reunification be regarded as unquestionable these families were not broken up by some natural disaster one spouse simply came here voluntarily the family could be reunited by that spouse returning home moreover some of these families were never united in the first place an immigrant who after immigration selects a spouse from back in the old country benefits from the reunification preference too indeed this must also be happening in the highest preference category for immigration spouses and minor children of american citizens about 200000 in 1994 sounds romantic yank at oxford marries indian maharajah but in fact some proportion of that inflow is due not to nativeborn americans but to immigrants who have simply graduated to citizenship by fulfilling the fiveyear waiting period and other minimal requirements and then imported a family how many as usual no one knows but assuming naturalized citizens sponsor close family members at about the same rate as legal permanent residents it could easily be half obviously naturalized are not on the same moral footing as nativeborn citizens when it comes to importing spouses the law should distinguish between them for that matter what about the moral footing of much of that backlog for spouses and children of permanent residents an estimated 80 percent of them are sponsored by the illegal immigrants who were amnestied under the 1986 immigration reform and control act under the jordan proposal these amnestied illegals are to be rewarded for a second time for breaking american law and why should the united states take in refugees its the american tradition is the standard reply but its not the 1798 alien and sedition acts were passed partly because of fear of refugees from the french revolution historically few immigrants have come to america as a result of political disruption at home contrary to myth there was no explicit recognition of refugees in us law until select groups were admitted after world war ii the united states did not acquire a comprehensive refugee policy until the 1980 refugee act the idea that the united states should be sort of an international kleenex mopping up the blood spilled in foreign conflicts is completely new in reality the refugee program is a subsidized expedited immigration program for politically favored groups for example about 40 percent of the 110000 refugees in 1994 came from the former soviet union mostly jews whom the united states is obliged to accept automatically as refugees along with ukrainian catholics and pentecostals under the socalled lautenberg amendment almost none of these were from the 2 million people displaced by postcommunist conflicts in the former soviet union and identified as refugees by the united nations these refugees are immediately eligible for welfare and tend to stay on it welfare participation among exsoviets is more than 16 percent compared to about 7 percent for nativeborn americans according to borjas ironically immigration enthusiasts often cite this in excusing the high immigrant welfare participation rate 9 percent overall somehow they never suggest abolishing the refugee category altogether such unsentimental questioning of immigration policy does not sound nice but after a 30year immigration binge the united states is running out of nice options hence the ultimate meanspirited thought whose country is it anyway immigration is a classic example of the type of policy where a and b get together to decide what c should do for d in this case c is our children and d is a group of foreigners if the transformation of america continues our children will bear the brunt

debtceiling debate shouldnt prevent house republicans from tackling comprehensive immigration reform a practical commonground solution could improve americas fiscal health and its what the majority of voters are calling for byline javier h valdés oped contributor section commentary length 1045 words opponents of immigration reform are once again speculating about the death of comprehensive immigration reform this year and at first glance the house of representatives calendar is too full with other issues chiefly now the budget battle and government shutdown as well as the looming debt ceiling fight while congress certainly has other important issues to consider this year the notion that the house cannot advance immigration legislation because of lack of votes or lack of time is flawed in fact comprehensive immigration reform has been gaining momentum among republicans who are listening to their constituents demands and tackling immigration reform with practical common ground solutions has the potential to improve americas long and shortterm fiscal health as well on october 5th supporters of comprehensive immigration reform will rally in more than 100 cities and the capitol to demand speedy action house republicans would be wise to listen to what overwhelming majorities of us citizens as well as small businesses faith communities and the technology and agricultural sectors are clamoring for comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 house democrats released their own version of a comprehensive immigration reform bill yesterday to remind their gop colleagues of this issues urgency but they need republican support to make real progress meanwhile house republicans are reportedly working on a series of smallerscale proposals after their party leadership refused to vote on the comprehensive immigration bill that the senate passed with strong bipartisan support earlier this year the senate legislation included the provision for an earned path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants contingent on a heavy immigration enforcement buildup the spring immigration debate in the senate that led to this bipartisan bill was largely the result of legislators wakeup call from the 2012 elections when latino and immigrant voters overwhelmingly supported democrats and helped deliver president obamas reelection the momentum remains on the side of latinos immigrants and other supporters of reform and the overwhelming majority of americans favor comprehensive immigration reform rather than piecemeal changes or those that focus on enforcementonly approaches or work visas for particular industries over the summer advocates of reform organized approximately 1200 events including vigils and protests in more than 40 states attended nearly 150 town halls conducted more than 350 congressional visits collected 600000 signatures for a petition for house speaker john boehner and contacted members of congress nearly 100000 times according to the alliance for citizenships database now on oct 5 supporters will again rally nationwide to demand comprehensive immigration reform these grassroots efforts have paid off despite many republicans concern about alienating their base by supporting comprehensive immigration reform at least 26 house republicans have publicly supported a path to citizenship including new yorks rep peter king mr king saw that 80 percent of his long island constituents support reform including 70 percent of republicans a figure that echoes national survey results he heard the myriad phone calls to his office listened to voters at the dozens of public events they organized and opted to take a clear public stance republicans like king who have earned our praise have recognized what became abundantly clear in november 2012 and what remains so today comprehensive immigration reform is one of those rare marriages of good policy and good politics it should constitute common ground for republicans and democrats as many senators have already shown comprehensive immigration reform is good policy because it offers a commonsense solution to our broken immigration system by offering an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants while updating our visa system and border security system while many proimmigrant groups like ours feel the senate bill went too far in further militarizing our borders we accepted that politics is the art of the possible and compromise was necessary we hope and expect that those with views different from ours will recognize the same we further know what myriad studies have shown comprehensive immigration reform would not only keep millions of families together but also reinvigorate our economy and help strengthen national priorities like social security such reform is ultimately good politics for republicans because without it the antiimmigrant albatross will remain firmly fixed around their necks failure by the gopcontrolled house to pass a comprehensive bill would reaffirm what most latino and immigrant voters were thinking when they voted for democrats last november the gop does not take their needs seriously and the latino and immigrant electorate will only continue to grow but opponents of reform continue to stall presenting the likely fall house calendar in september for his republican colleagues house majority leader eric cantor prioritized other issues before immigration reform saying only that the house may begin considering some immigration reform legislation given the other items on the calendar rep bob goodlatte r of virginia who chairs the house judiciary committee has said his committee will take up various pieces of immigrationrelated legislation in october but without including a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants and without providing a clear timeline for action this is simply not good enough the notion that lawkmakers cannot debate issues like the federal budget while advancing comprehensive immigration reform legislation is an insult to our congress and an insult to voters and the notion that immigration reform should take a back seat to a manufactured debtceiling crisis is even more preposterous its time for the house of representatives to follow the will of the american people and pass comprehensive immigration reform this fall javier

post staff writer section a section pg a04 length 859 words as the congressional debate over immigration heats up powerful elements of the american business community are entering the fray to oppose major proposed cuts in legal immigration that many companies fear would inhibit their ability to compete in the global economy dozens of executives from leading hightech firms yesterday descended on capitol hill to argue for separating the issues of legal and illegal immigration in proposed legislation that is moving through the house and taking shape in the senate the lobbying effort reflects concerns among us companies that their ability to hire highly skilled foreign talent as legal immigrants will become ensnared in a political backlash against illegal immigration legal immigration strengthens and energizes america the national association of manufacturers which counts 13500 corporate members nationwide said in a statement americas hightech employees and international personnel should not be considered in the same bill as undocumented entrants and criminal law violators the main target of the lobbying effort is a house bill sponsored by rep lamar s smith rtex chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration it would cut legal immigration by 30 percent reduce refugee admissions by more than 50 percent and crack down on illegal immigrants through a variety of means including border fences and more border patrol agents the bill also calls for creation of a computer registry to verify that prospective employees are legally eligible to work in the united states in the senate sen alan k simpson rwyo is introducing a bill that would slash legal immigration even more sharply as part of legislation that like the house version links legal and illegal immigration in the same bill in addition the bipartisan us commission on immigration reform headed by former congresswoman barbara jordan dtex yesterday released a report that offers detailed recommendations for cuts in legal immigration while supporting the basic framework of immigration policy although the proposed cuts in admissions of highly skilled foreigners would affect a relatively small portion of annual immigration they have caught the attention of such firms as microsoft motorola and texas instruments which were among nearly 60 hightech firms whose executives voiced their objections on capitol hill yesterday up to now the most outspoken opposition to cuts in legal immigration has come from hispanic organizations religious groups and other traditional immigration advocates which have much less clout than the business community with the republicancontrolled congress of the legal immigration limit of nearly 800000 for fiscal 1995 skillsbased admissions are set at 140000 the smith bill would directly and indirectly remove more than 32000 of these admissions while the simpson bill would cut them to 75000 the commission on immigration reform recommends a level of 100000 our ability to get the best talent in the world is critical to us said kenneth m alvares a vice president of sun microsystems a fastgrowing silicon valley computer chip company restricting that ability is going to kill us he said we will not be able to compete the firm which employs 16000 people has been unable to fill more than 1000 highly technical positions and feels it must recruit foreigners if cuts in skilled admissions are enacted alvares said his company might be forced to do its design work abroad we have thousands of companies that care about this said phyllis eisen a senior policy director at the national association of manufacturers if they cant get the people they want they will move overseas such immigration cutbacks thus could result in a loss of jobs in the united states said charles billingsley a spokesman for the information technology association of america i dont think thats what the legislators have in mind proponents of the simpson bill argue that reducing the influx of immigrants is what the american public wants in order to address the need for engineers and scientists say congressional sources close to the simpson bill the legislation would require employers of highly skilled immigrants to pay a fee equal to 30 percent of the employees firstyear salary into a fund to help finance training for americans a potentially farreaching provision of the house and senate bills is the provision for a centralized computer verification system which employers would use to check that a prospective new hire was legally in the country and eligible to work company executives expressed concern that inaccurate or incomplete responses from the new system could result in large numbers of false denials of employment to qualified applicants and lead to costly lawsuits with 65 million new hires a year in the united states an error rate of only 5 percent would cause the computer to wrongly reject more than 3 million people and tests of federal data

his family came to this country from trinidad he says he grew up thinking he was as american as the next guy he pledged allegiance to the flag at public school served in the us army and later in life paid taxes except for not being able to vote it never bothered him that he was a legal immigrant with a green card instead of a citizen with a us passport but resentment toward immigrants even legal residents is building in america like thunder clouds on a summer night ramgobin who is now 32 felt compelled to make a change on monday he stood in a woodpaneled maryland courtroom raised his right hand and took an oath of fidelity to the united states of america becoming a citizen with 50 other immigrants its a stigma today being an immigrant he said a debate over what to do about the more than a million foreigners who move to this country every year is spreading and is challenging cherished notions about what america is all about the nations generous tradition of accepting the worlds tired hungry and poor has always been a proud symbol of the country but today from the town halls of california to the marble corridors of congress lawmakers and citizens are questioning just what this countrys commitments to immigrants should be how many immigrants and refugees do we need what are they owed what can they be denied the country sees itself in a situation where its not sure it can invite all these people in said rodolfo o de la garza an immigration specialist at the university of texas in austin most immigrants are selfsupporting and contribute to the wellbeing of their communities in many inner cities they have revitalized entire neighborhoods opening stores and providing longlost services to communities many industries too rely on foreignborn workers to fill skilled technical jobs like engineering nevertheless growing numbers of americans fear that immigrants are threatening the national culture and their personal economic wellbeing those fears are being transferred into political action and a change this year in immigration policy is almost inevitable according to many immigration experts and politicians the political will in the republicancontrolled congress is so set and the public mood on immigration so sour that those hoping to maintain relatively liberal immigration policies will be facing a tough struggle we dont have a problem anymore we have a crisis and thats why we have to do something right now said rep lamar smith r texas chairman of the subcommittee on international law immigration and refugees for the house judiciary committee already president clinton has shown a willingness to respond to such concerns making it clear through his actions that he believes there are limits to the countrys openness he has bolstered efforts to catch illegal immigrants increasing the money and personnel for border patrols he has adopted a tougher stand than his republican predecessors on limiting the entry of refugees and asylumseekers last summer he detained tens of thousands of haitians and cubans at the us naval base in guantanamo cuba instead of allowing them onto us soil to await decisions on whether they could stay he changed the policy under which cubans automatically received asylum here critics say that clinton mindful that immigration is a likely 1996 presidential campaign issue is playing politics the clinton administration has taken an unduly restrictive approach said arthur helton a refugee advocate for the open society institute its too closely attuned to the meanspirited immigration debate in this country that debate is likely to turn 1995 into a year of decisions and choices on immigration comprehensive bills to change immigration policy are being assembled in the house and senate the focus of policy change is expanding while illegal immigrants have long been the subject of public ire legal immigrants now are being cast as part of the problem already the house as part of the republican contract with america has adopted a welfare bill that would deny benefits to legal immigrants immigration advocates fear that things will only get worse early this month a bipartisan commission handed clinton a recommendation that the numbers of legal immigrants and refugees that the country accepts be trimmed sharply a key provision would make it more difficult for extended families to be reunited in this country the allotment of visas for reuniting the families of citizens and legal residents would be cut by onefifth the openings for refugees would be halved and the 10000 special slots for unskilled workers would be eliminated frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum said he was stunned by the commissions report thats an unfair backlash against legal immigration stemming from a frustration over illegal immigration sharry said but the us commission on immigration reform appointed by congress in 1990 and headed by former democratic rep barbara jordan of texas was hardly out on a limb with its recommendations these bills are pending or will soon be introduced in congress borders and benefits sen alan k simpson r wyo chairman of the subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs for the judiciary committee has introduced legislation that would strengthen the us border patrol deny public benefits to illegal residents and repeal a 1960 law that grants automatic asylum to cubans it also would test a national identification system that would make it harder for illegal residents to find work or receive public services simpson also plans to sponsor another bill to reduce the number of legal immigrants families rep smith of texas is at work on a comprehensive bill on legal and illegal immigration that will be introduced wednesday the bill is expected to endorse the commissions recommendation to end chain migration or the movement of extended families into this country specifically it would end the special preference given to reuniting the sisters brothers and adult children of legal immigrants instead that priority would be reserved for the parents or minor children of legal immigrants children rep brian bilbray r calif has sponsored a bill to end automatic citizenship to the children born on us soil to illegal immigrants bilbray a freshman from san diego said that in 1992 in california alone 96000 children were born to illegal residents the word is out all over the world that you can just come here illegally and you dont have to worry bilbray said thats the kind of message weve got to stop we need to bring credibility back to immigration law the political mood in congress today is a far cry from what it was in 1990 when the legislature passed one of the most expansive immigrations laws in recent times the immigration act of 1990 allowed for more visas for skilled and unskilled workers as well as for family members of legal immigrants it also created a special pool of visas to be handed out by lottery but that was then and this is now americans have become increasingly anxious about their jobs and futures american people going into the 1990s are feeling pinched in a lot of ways said lawrence h fuchs an immigration historian at brandeis university you have this growing sense of unease and a certain amount of scapegoating takes place fuchs who was vice chairman of the immigration commission said the government needed to revise the way it selected permanent residents immigration is not a free good fuchs said there are costs as well as benefits and thats why the immigration admission system has to be regulated with very clear goals and priorities if there was any doubt about the public mood toward immigration consider the strong show of support in november for californias proposition 187 the measure would deny educational medical and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants for the last 40 years illegal and legal immigration has been running wild and has

sun washington post staff writer section a section pg a04 length 971 words the haitian soldiers who went to the womans house that day wore stockings over their heads to disguise their faces they mocked her political work in support of jeanbertrand aristide the president overthrown a few months earlier in a military coup they threatened to kill her then while her mother was forced to watch three soldiers raped and beat her the woman who was 27 and married is unable to bear children as a result of the attacks she fled to the united states in july 1992 five months after the attacks and sought political asylum her request was denied a us immigration judge ruled that she had failed to prove she was persecuted because of her political beliefs but last month the board of immigration appeals overturned the decision the board an administrative decisionmaking body found that her rape was a form of political persecution in a ruling that all asylum officers and immigration judges are now required to apply in deciding similar cases last week in a related step the immigration and naturalization service issued new guidelines formally recognizing that rape domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women can constitute grounds for asylum only canada had previously adopted such specific measures on asylum cases related to gender the guidelines and the board decision reflect a growing recognition in the united states and abroad that violence against women solely because they are women can constitute serious human rights violations and should therefore be considered when granting asylum in the past the fact that an asylum claim was based on a rape or some other genderrelated factor would result in its dismissal as merely personal by us immigration authorities even if it amounted to persecution on account of political opinion according to deborah anker a founding member of the women refugees project at harvard law school and the cambridge and somerville legal services the group was instrumental in helping the ins develop the guidelines until quite recently there were few federal court decisions that addressed the claims of women to asylum protection even tangentially she said but in the last few years there has been growing attention to human rights abuses based on gender prompted in part by international atrocities such as the mass rape of women in bosnia as part of ethnic cleansing the systematic use of rape in haiti by police and soldiers during and after the 1991 coup against aristide and the domestic violence in rwanda immigration officials and advocates said these claims werent made in the past but theyre beginning to be made now said t alexander aleinikoff general counsel of the immigration service in an important decision last december an immigration judge in arlington granted political asylum for the first time to a 51yearold jordanian woman whose government had failed to protect her from over three decades of physical and mental abuse by her husband the immigration service initially turned down her request for asylum arguing that it was simply a case of domestic abuse that should be settled in another forum the husband was from a wealthy wellconnected jordanian family among his good friends was the head of the secret police who gave him a gun that the husband later used to shoot at his wife after getting drunk the husband often beat his wife even when she was pregnant and once used a tennis racket to hit her when he found her studying for a high school equivalency exam in his decision judge paul a najelski wrote that the woman had been persecuted because she sought her own identity and espoused western values in a country where wives generally are expected to subordinate themselves to their husbands also she was among a group of women who were unwilling to live their lives in a harem at the mercy of their husbands their society and their government he wrote this ruling marked the first recognition that spousal abuse can become a form of persecution under some conditions the jordanian woman had suffered at her husbands hands because of her beliefs and she could not get real protection from the jordanian authorities because of those same beliefs the ins guidelines took effect immediately they do not lower the standard for asylum that must be met for women women will have to meet the same basic tests as men and all asylum cases will continue to be decided on a casebycase basis applicants seeking asylum in the united states must still demonstrate a wellfounded fear of persecution based on race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group some groups that favor less immigration such as the federation for american immigration reform fair have argued that permitting genderrelated asylum claims will produce a rush of claims by many thousands of women who will see an easy opportunity to obtain legal status in the united states we cannot bring people here simply because they are suffering under general cultural forms of oppression said dan stein president of fair although most of the worlds refugees are women and children supporters of the new guidelines argue that women are often the least able to leave refugee camps or their native countries to seek asylum abroad and are unlikely to produce the flood of asylum claims that opponents fear in the two years since canada adopted specific guidelines 195 genderrelated claims for asylum were accepted according to canadian officials that accounts for about 2

words dateline washington a florida congressman will propose today that children of illegal immigrants  no longer be considered american citizens simply because they are born here but rep mark foleys constitutional amendment is only a small part of the immigration showdown likely to take place in congress this summer lawmakers and interest groups are divided into two basic camps those who believe  illegal immigration is out of control and those who believe legal immigration  is too foley a west palm beach republican says at least one parent should be a  legal resident of the united states for the child to be a citizen under  current law any baby born here is a citizen eligible for welfare and health  benefits and is impossible to deport no matter what the parents status at least 50 other immigration bills have been introduced in congress some  to deny benefits or education to illegal immigrants and some to stop all immigration at least for a while president clinton wants to beef up border patrols a national identification system is also being debated we have got a collision between compassion and reality said rep  porter goss rsanibel we simply dont have the ability to keep doing what  were doing no matter what our hearts may say the united states is admitting 11million immigrants a year about 900000  of them legally the rest sneak across the land borders or fly here as  tourists and students then fail to return home youre so right about the compassion nobody wants to be a bad guy  rep sonny bono rcalif told goss at a subcommittee hearing wednesday bono supported proposition 187 in california to deny welfare and education  to illegal immigrants the intent was never to be a bad guy the intent was  to say this is out of order bono said florida now has two movements similar to proposition 187 and its leaders expect overwhelming support americans have been ambivalent about immigration for 200 years thats why immigrants have historically arrived in waves sometimes war or a bad economy kept them from migrating but sometimes america slammed the door the door was reopened most recently in 1965 and immigration has increased steadily since poll after poll shows americans have had enough and politicians last year took notice california gov pete wilson revived his political career with the issue florida gov lawton chiles used it early and often clearly immigration has emerged as a hotbutton issue a potential wedge  issue in american politics said frank sharry executive director of the  national immigration forum which supports immigration its increasingly being used by interest groups and politicians as an  easy explanation for a number of problems that our society faces so when you  talk about high taxes you blame immigration you talk about crime you blame immigration you talk about welfare you blame immigration many americans fail to distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants  sharry said even if they know the difference most voters believe that  immigrants of any kind drain the economy and rely heavily on welfare sharry denies it but both sides in this debate have statistics to back up their views the house passed a welfare bill in march that would deny most benefits to  legal immigrants they would have to become american citizens before they  would be eligible for welfare a senate bill being debated in committee today  would leave that decision up to the states it has been our policy for 100 years that newcomers should be selfsupporting said sen alan simpson rwyo simpson who chairs an immigration subcommittee and his counterpart in the house rep lamar smith rtexas are among those who believe legal  immigration is crippling the country they have promised to introduce bills  this summer that would slash the number of legal immigrants by hundreds of  thousands per year and revise the rules under which immigrants are admitted why are we taking immigrants at all whats the role asks dan stein executive director of fair the federation for american immigration reform perhaps the leading antiimmigration group in washington stein says a moratorium would address every objection to immigration  whether the worries are based on overpopulation the environment the costs of education and health care for immigrants or time for assimilation not everyone would be happy cuban exiles in florida for instance are  already disgruntled with clintons new policy to repatriate cubans the policy  no longer presumes they are all fleeing political persecution but stein said the cuban community in miami simply cannot continue to  be unreasonable they have a private grievance with fidel castro that  shouldnt drive us immigration or foreign policy opposing immigration is a sure winner for any presidential candidate in  1996 stein says an issue strong enough to drive a thirdparty movement if  the democrats and republicans dont address it he was delighted recently to  hear presidential candidate patrick buchanan call for a moratorium but sharry said politicians step into treacherous currents when they take  the immigration issue beyond sound bites as the lights get turned on in the debate the policymaking is going to  get much more complicated he said the magic bullets cut legal  immigration the national id card are going to be a lot more difficult to  enact both politically and practically the debate is further complicated because immigration does not stick to  party lines some republicans are working hard to stop most immigration while  others see open borders as part of the freemarket system republican leaders including rep newt gingrich and sen bob dole extol  the contributions of immigrants several members of congress are immigrants  even floridas foley talks about his polish grandmother who cleaned motel  toilets in her effort to seize the american dream im hardpressed to think of a single problem that would be solved by  shutting off the supply of willing and eager new americans house majority  leader dick armey rtexas said recently immigration reform he said should make immigration more orderly not  more restrictive loaddate may 25 1995 language english

brimelow random house 306 pages 3350 byline by daniel stoffman section arts pg h16 length 1017 words    in canada immigration is usually portrayed as a leftright issue with the left in favor and the right against in fact the political right is deeply split on this sensitive subject thats why rightwinger peter brimelow finds himself attacking his ideological soulmates as he dissects american immigration policy in his book alien nation open unselective immigration the prevailing policy in both canada and the us is a logical outgrowth of neoconservative ideology neoconservatives believe that market forces not governments should determine how many immigrants come to a country the true believer wants to remove as much power as possible from government including the power to control the nations borders he rejects the counterargument that uncontrolled immigration is damaging to the national or collective interest for him there is no such thing as the collective interest only individual interests the second reason the right typically favors wideopen immigration is practical rather than ideological increasing the supply of labor decreases its price brian mulroneys progressive conservative government representing bay street dumped the traditional canadian immigration program which was one of moderate fluctuating levels with an emphasis on skills in favor of a new program of permanent high immigration levels the populist right on the other hand includes in its constituency people who actually work for hourly wages and therefore disapprove of polices aimed at depressing them this explains why the reform party representing main street supports a return to normal immigration levels brimelow who used to live in canada where he wrote for macleans and the financial post and now writes for the business elites who read the wall street journal and forbes comes down on the side of the populists by urging a sharp cut in us immigration he takes issue with the journals ultraconservative editor robert bartley who wants totally open borders brimelow minces no words about who benefits from the sort of policies the journal advocates drawing on the work of the economist george borjas he demonstrates that current us immigration policy has only one significant economic impact to drive down the wages of us workers by 120 billion a year where does this vast sum go into the pockets of the capitalists of course the american elites support for immigration may not be idealistic at all concludes brimelow but selfinterested as a way to prey on their fellow americans alien nation is full of informative data like this much of it as relevant to canadians as to americans because on a per capita basis we have twice as much immigration as the americans do and our immigration program like theirs is now based chiefly on family relationships rather than skills unfortunately the book is marred by brimelows peculiar ideas on the subject of race until the immigration and nationality act amendments of 1965 the us favored whites over nonwhites in its immigration policy canada got rid of a similar policy about the same time but by choosing to accept immigrants mainly on the basis of family relationships both countries now in effect restrict immigration to residents of a handful of nonwhite countries because they are the only ones who have recentlyarrived relatives who wish to sponsor them this is unfair to prospective immigrants who dont have sponsors and gives the receiving country no control over who gets in but brimelow thinks the sponsorship system is bad mainly because it is tilting the racial balance of the us which was 90 per cent white 30 years ago and should in his opinion have stayed that way a british immigrant himself he seems to think the us is essentially a white british nation this is a profound misunderstanding of a country that has always been multicultural and whose major contribution to world civilization is jazz music a black invention brimelow nowhere suggests that nonwhites are inferior but he believes that different races cant get along and that countries with racially diverse populations will inevitably succumb to multiethnic mayhem his argument is unconvincing canada britain and australia are examples of countries where people of different races coexist peacefully moreover racial and cultural uniformity is no guarantee of social harmony somalia for example is one of the most homogeneous nations in the world and yet it destroyed itself in a civil war by his misguided emphasis on race brimelow gives those he calls immigration enthusiasts a chance to dismiss the rest of the book when they might learn something by reading it high immigration levels are neither necessary nor beneficial to the economy mass immigration hurts those at the bottom of the social ladder the skill levels of immigrants are in freefall massive nonwhite immigration coupled with affirmative action quotas make an explosive combination these are just a few of the points brimelow makes and they are just as applicable to canada as to the us his best argument is the what if question what if those who favor the current policy are wrong the result will be severe and longstanding economic social and environmental problems but what if those who favor less immigration are wrong the result would be a temporary labor shortage that could easily be fixed by opening the immigration tap a bit wider in other words the consequences of too little immigration are minimal while those of too much are grave there is no good reason to risk those consequences as brimelow points out high immigration levels are not an unstoppable natural phenomenon but rather the result of deliberate government policy and since that policy is both unnecessary and deeply unpopular brimelow is probably right in predicting that it will soon be changed daniel stoffman made a study of immigration policy as the 19911992

california byline ken mclaughlin mercury news staff writer section front pg 15a length 996 words at first glance todays house immigration subcommittee hearing is just another madefortelevision event that will titillate cspan viewers but few others on deeper examination though it represents the beginning of a landmark debate about whether a key element of the american dream the countrys tradition of welcoming immigrants to its shores has gone haywire the hearing will be led by texas republican lamar smith who has promised to introduce a bill next month to overhaul the countrys immigration system both legal and illegal from top to bottom the debate will have extraordinary significance for california where about onethird of legal immigrants settle i understand we all are immigrants or descendants of immigrants but the united states is like a boat or plane said yeh lingling an orinda resident who works for the washingtonbased carrying capacity network at some point you have to draw the line and say were all full she and other restrictionists argue that immigration from the third world is resulting in overcrowded schools and a cauldron of competition for low skill jobs in minority communities immigration advocates counter that the newcomers are revitalizing neighborhoods and generating jobs through their entrepreneurial spirit one of the first witnesses at todays hearing will be peter brimelow author of a sizzling new book called alien nation its tenet the united states is committing cultural and economic suicide by accepting too many third world immigrants the debate about legal immigration is expected to pick up further momentum when the bipartisan us commission on immigration reform headed by former texas rep barbara jordan issues recommendations on the subject next month some politicians predict that the national debate that will emerge during the next few months is bound to be as divisive as californias debate over proposition 187 aimed at denying public services to illegal immigrants the premise of alien nation and antiimmigration groups is basically that these new immigrants dont look like us and dont sound like us so we ought to fear and reject them said robert rubin of the lawyers committee for civil rights in san francisco and even proposition 187s leading proponents now concede that the debate within their ranks was never as simple as their own campaign rhetoric some people just werent interested in whether the immigration was legal or illegal said rick oltman who was chairman of the yes on 187 save our state committee anytime anybody in our group started talking about legal immigration wed cut them off and say it wasnt pertinent for his part oltman would like to see the united states slash legal immigration levels by at least a third and im a moderate in that group oltman said laughing he agrees with brimelow an immigrant from england on one major point right now our immigration policy is changing the racial makeup of the country oltman said and thats never been done before in history the countrys changing complexion is largely the result of the immigration and nationality act amendments of 1965 which replaced what was seen as a racist system with one based on family reunification and job skills most immigration restrictionists though say their reasons are environmental not racial we only care about the numbers said monique miller executive director of the carrying capacity network her 6yearold organization and the older federation for immigration reform fair have called for a fiveyear immigration moratorium to give the country a chance to catch its breath while it develops a new immigration policy rep bob stump rariz and sen richard shelby rala have introduced moratorium bills stumps has 64 cosponsors restrictionists point to new studies showing that legal immigrants use welfare more than nativeborn americans and they say nearly twothirds entering every year are lowskilled reflecting the laborintensive economy of the past rather than the global economy of the future i talk to so many people and they are concerned about the future not about the browning of america said restrictionist yeh an ethnic chinese who was born in vietnam and raised in cambodia before immigrating from france to the united states 15 years ago they just feel the countrys falling apart but proimmigration groups which include a righttoleft array of business interests labor unions and civil rights organizations argue that the restrictionists are using hysteria rather than reason this xenophobic refrain is the same one used against immigrants 100 years ago said kathleen sullivan a san francisco immigration attorney proimmigrant organizations argue that immigrants tend to be selfreliant want to assimilate and live in strong stable families i meet people on the street and their first reaction is immigration thats terrible you have to do something about it said warren leiden executive director of the american immigration lawyers association and a member of jordans commission but leiden said that once he explains to the critics that modern legal immigration is mostly based on uniting families and its not some gift were giving to strangers many americans turn around on the issue virtually nobody even those calling for a moratorium is talking about denying us citizens the right to bring in spouses and unmarried minor children but some restrictionists are questioning whether citizens parents should be automatically entitled to enter as in current policy

750 of 997 documents the atlanta journal and constitution april 30 1995 sunday all editions immigration time for a change enough america is drowning in a sea of immigrants says the author of a new book he warns we are becoming an alien nation byline peter brimelow section perspective pg 1g length 2100 words there is a sense in which current immigration policy is adolf hitlers posthumous revenge on america the us political elite emerged from the war passionately concerned to cleanse itself from all taints of racism or xenophobia eventually it enacted the epochal immigration act technically the immigration and nationality act amendments of 1965 and this quite accidentally triggered a renewed mass immigration so huge and so systematically different from anything that had gone before as to transform and ultimately perhaps even to destroy the one unquestioned victor of world war ii the american nation as it had evolved by the middle of the 20th century today us government policy is literally dissolving the people and electing a new one you can be for this or you can be against it but the fact is undeniable still time magazine wrote in its fall 1993 special issue on multiculturalism for the first time in its history the us has an immigration policy that for better or worse is truly democratic as an immigrant albeit one who came here rather earlier than yesterday and is now an american citizen i find myself asking with fascination what can this possibly mean american immigration policy has always been democratic of course in the sense that it has been made through democratic procedures right now as a matter of fact its unusually undemocratic in the sense that americans have told pollsters long and loudly that they dont want any more immigration but the politicians ignore them the mass immigration so thoughtlessly triggered in 1965 risks making america an alien nation not merely in the sense that the numbers of aliens in the nation are rising to levels last seen in the 19th century not merely in the sense that america will become a freak among the worlds nations because of the unprecedented demographic mutation it is inflicting on itself not merely in the sense that americans themselves will become alien to each other requiring an increasingly strained government to arbitrate between them but ultimately in the sense that americans will no longer share in common what abraham lincoln called in his first inaugural address the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearth stone all over this broad land and that when the time comes to strike those chords no sweet sound will result my son is born alexander james frank brimelow is an american although i was still a british subject and his mother a canadian when he shot into the new york hospital delivery room yelling indignantly one summer dawn in 1991 this is because of the 14th amendment to the us constitution it states in part all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside the 14th amendment was passed after the civil war in an attempt to stop southern states denying their newly freed slaves the full rights of citizens but the wording is general so it has been interpreted to mean that any child born in the united states is automatically a citizen even if its mother is a foreigner even if shes just passing through i am delighted that alexander is an american however i do feel slightly well guilty that his fellow americans had so little choice in the matter but at least maggy and i had applied for and been granted legal permission to live in the united states there are currently an estimated 35 to 4 million foreigners who have just arrived and settled here in defiance of american law when these illegal immigrants have children in the united states why those children are automatically american citizens too and right now twothirds of the births in los angeles county hospitals are to illegalimmigrant mothers all of which is just another example of one of my central themes the united states has lost control of its borders in every sense a series of institutional accidents of which birthright citizenship is just one has essentially robbed americans of the power to determine who and how many can enter their national family make claims on it and exert power over it the heart of the problem immigration in 1991 the year of alexanders birth the immigration and naturalization service reported a total of over 18 million legal immigrants that was easily a record it exceeded by almost a third the previous peak of almost 13 million reached 84 years earlier at the height of the first great wave of immigration which peaked just after the turn of the century the united states has been engulfed by what seems likely to be the greatest wave of immigration it has ever faced the ins estimates that 12 million to 13 million legal and illegal immigrants will enter the united states during the 1990s the washington dcbased federation for american immigration reform fair among the most prominent of the groups critical of immigration policy thinks the total will range between 10 million and 15 million an independent expert daniel james author of illegal immigration an unfolding crisis has argued that it could be as high as 18 million its not just illegal immigration that is out of control so is legal immigration us iaw in effect treats immigration as a sort of imitation civil right extended to an indefinite group of foreigners who have been selected arbitrarily and with no regard to american interests the american immigration debate has been a oneway street criticism of immigration and news that might support it just tends not to get through for example the united states is in the midst of a serious crime epidemic yet almost no americans are aware that aliens make up one quarter of the prisoners in federal penitentiaries almost three times their proportion in the population at large indeed many problems that currently preoccupy americans have an unspoken immigration dimension two further instances the healthcare crisis americans have been told repeatedly that some 30 million to 40 million people in the country have no health insurance at any one point in time typically nobody seems to know how many are immigrants but immigrants certainly make up a disproportionate share particularly of the real problem the much smaller hard core perhaps 6 million that remains uninsured after two years we know that about 6 million of the 22 million us hispanics are uninsured at any one point since almost a third of us hispanics are foreignborn its obvious that immigrants and their children must be some and perhaps most of them the hard core of uninsured experts confirm is substantially hispanic that probably includes many of the estimated nearly 2 million uninsured illegal immigrants permanently settled here a heavily hispanic group the education crisis americans are used to hearing that their schools dont seem to be providing the quality of education that foreigners get fewer of them know that the us education system is also very expensive by international standards virtually none of them know anything about the impact of immigration on that education system yet the impact of immigration is clearly serious for example in 1990 almost one child in every 20 enrolled in american public schools either could not speak english or spoke it so poorly as to need language assistance programs this number is increasing with striking speed only six years earlier it had been one child in 31 current law is generally interpreted as requiring schools to educate such children in their native language to do so according to one california estimate requires spending some 65 percent more per child than on an englishspeaking child and not merely money but more importantly teacher time and energy are inevitably being diverted from americas children my thesis is that the immigration resulting from current public policy 1 is dramatically larger less skilled and more divergent from the american majority than anything that was anticipated or desired 2 is probably not beneficial economically and is certainly not necessary 3 is attended by a wide and increasing range of negative consequences from the physical environment to the political 4 is bringing about an ethnic and racial transformation in america without precedent in the history of the world an astonishing social experiment launched with no particular reason to expect success some of my american readers will be stirring uneasily at this point they have been trained to recoil from any explicit discussion of race and anyone who says anything critical of immigration is going to be accused of racism because the term racist is now so debased i usually shrug off such smears by pointing to its new definition anyone who is winning an argument with a liberal or too often a libertarian and on the immigration issue even some confused conservatives this may sound facetious but the double standards are irritating anyone who has got into an immigration debate with for example hispanic activists must be instantly aware that some of them really are consumed by the most intense racial animosity directed against whites how come whats sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander i have indeed duly examined my own motives and i am happy to report that they are pure i sincerely believe i am not prejudiced in the sense of committing and stubbornly persisting in error about people regardless of evidence which appears to me to be the only rational definition of racism i am also however not blind race and ethnicity are destiny in american politics and because of the rise of affirmative action quotas for american individuals too my son alexander is a white male with blue eyes and blond hair he has never discriminated against anyone in his little life except possibly young women visitors whom he suspects of being babysitters but public policy now discriminates against him the sheer size of the so called protected classes that are now politically favored such as hispanics will be a matter of vital importance as long as he lives and their size is basically determined by immigration for americans even to think about their immigration policy given the political climate that has prevailed since the 1960s involves a sort of psychological liberation movement in eugene mccarthys terms america would have to stop being a colony of the world the implications are shocking even frightening that americans without feeling guilty can and should seize control of their countrys destiny if they did what would a decolonized american immigration policy look like the first step is absolutely clear the 1965 immigration act and its amplifications in 1986 and 1990 have been a disaster and must be repealed it may be time for the united states to consider moving to a conception of itself more like that of switzerland tolerating a fairly large foreign presence that comes and goes but rarely if ever naturalizes it may be time to consider reviving a version of the bracero program the agricultural guestworkers program that operated from the 1940s to the 1960s allowing foreign workers to move in and out of the country in a controlled way without permanently altering its demography and politics this new conception may be a shock to american sensibilities many americans like my students at the university of cincinnati law school are under the charming impression that foreigners dont really exist but they also tend to think that if foreigners really do exist they ought to become americans as quickly as possible however the fact is that we foreigners are in some sense all americans now just as jefferson said everyone had two countries his own and france in the 18th century that is why we are here just as the entire world flocked to imperial rome the trick the americans face now is to be an empire in fact

writer section first section page a16 length 916 words republican leaders in congress are divided over when and where to launch their promised legislative offensive on immigration this year sen alan k simpson rwyo incoming chairman of the senate immigration subcommittee has a bill ready to introduce right away that would substantially cut the number of legal immigrants entering the country meanwhile rep lamar s smith rtex incoming chairman of the house immigration panel says he wants to focus on illegal immigration and take his time developing a comprehensive bill even if final action doesnt come until early 1996 deciding whether to focus on legal or illegal immigration and whether to move quickly whichever direction they go are only two of the unresolved matters facing the republican leadership on this issue highimmigration states especially california are certain again to seek reimbursement for government expenses related to illegal immigration adding to the competing demands at a time of budget tightening many republicans favor some kind of computerized system to verify eligibility for employment and benefits but there are broad differences over how expensive or intrusive such a system should be disagreements already are developing over the welfare reform bill proposed by house republicans which virtually would eliminate the access of legal immigrants to federal benefit programs and any proposal to cut legal immigration such as simpsons is certain to provoke a heated internal debate underlying these fissures are some complex political considerations the republicans made immigration into a firstclass hotbutton issue in 1994 but it is not obvious what they should do now to guarantee that they will have it available again in 1996 said a senior democratic congressional strategist who asked not to be named do you start a fistfight over it and risk polarizing opinions even within your own party or do you seek consensus the democrat said do you try to ride it now while its still on peoples minds or do you wait to stoke it up again at the beginning of the 1996 primaries they dont have easy answers but then again neither do we the immigration and naturalization service and several cabinet departments delivered detailed options for potential administrative and legislative action on immigration to the white house over the past few weeks according to senior administration officials president clinton and his senior advisers are expected to make strategic decisions before the end of the month about where immigration fits in the administrations agenda for 1995 while immigration developed into a highly partisan issue last fall in the context of the californias campaigns for governor us senator and proposition 187 republican leaders expect to continue a congressional tradition of addressing immigration through bipartisan consensus some of the leadership asked me to draw up a republican immigration bill simpson said but i told them that i wasnt comfortable with that that it couldnt be done smith who said he expects to work closely with simpson said there is a temptation to make this a partisan issue and force something through congress quickly but ultimately i do not think that would produce an effective solution to the problem my goal is to take the time to do it right which means taking the time to build bipartisan support and public support for a comprehensive approach to the crisis of illegal immigration both simpson and smith are on the record as saying that such an approach must include some kind of identity system perhaps using the social security card to block illegal immigrants access to jobs and public benefits but virtually all such suggestions have aroused storms of opposition in the past on the basis of cost and practicality as well as claims that they would engender invasions of privacy and discrimination against people perceived to look like foreigners recognizing the potential for controversy smith said i do not want to be in the position of saying that i favor any one answer this is going to be the subject of a lot of hearings but a leisurely legislative schedule may not satisfy all republicans rep dana rohrabacher rcalif who represents some of the orange county communities that were in the forefront of the proposition 187 campaign said we are already behind the curve when it comes to a tamperproof social security card and so i am anxious to move forward as quickly as possible regardless of what kind of immigration legislation moves through the committee process rohrabacher vowed to take action on the floor to ensure that every appropriation and authorization bill has language prohibiting federal funds from ending up in the hands of illegal immigrants last year he bedeviled the democratic leadership with guerrilla warfare tactics with his own party now in control he said he expects to get votes on the merits of his case in their frequent crusades against illegal immigration many republicans like smith and rohrabacher have insisted they have nothing against legal immigrants now that some in their party are proposing action on legal immigrants however they find themselves in a difficult position smith for example said he had no final position on a proposal to deny welfare benefits to legal immigrants and rohrabacher called simpsons plan to

204 of 997 documents austin americanstatesman texas september 12 2013 thursday final edition immigration fraud crackdown overdue byline austin americanstatesman section main pg a8 length 855 words the desperate desire to obtain legal status combines with tangled us immigration laws to create a climate that invites deceit and fraud for perpetrators the risk of defrauding immigrants is small because the victims are reluctant to complain the amounts immigration consultants can make off their prey are limited only by their nefarious ambitions the last thing someone whose immigration status may be dubious wants to do is attract official attention the money unscrupulous immigration consultants can make far outweighs the limited risk but that could change the texas attorney general is becoming increasingly aggressive in chasing perpetrators of fraud federal legislation that would impose criminal penalties for immigration scams has been introduced at the moment however there is no national standard for pursuing fraud in texas the attorney generals office targets suspected scammers and recently got a settlement against an organization whose clients complained did them more harm than good cristo vive christ lives a secular organization that offered immigration consulting collected fees ranging from 232000 to 619000 annually but is now out of the immigration business as the americanstatesmans jeremy schwartz reported this week the organization and its owner jorge sanchez must comply with a court order that bars him from collecting money for immigration work and from using the name cristo vive sanchez and cristo vive were targeted by the texas attorney generals office in 2012 after a 2011 americanstatesman report that immigration cases handled by sanchez and his organization were bungled so badly that his clients faced arrest and deportation sanchez agreed to a court order to pay 250000 in restitution and faces a 300000 fine if he violates terms of the settlement with state authorities the settlement reached between sanchez and the state is the result of a civil case not criminal action this case is far from isolated immigration consultants flourish often implying that they are legally qualified to handle immigration cases when they are not clients often are charged for immigration forms that are free and thats just the beginning of a long ripoff that could lead to even bigger legal problems for them the texas attorney generals office has gotten increasingly aggressive in cracking down on immigration scams closing down 75 unauthorized immigration consultants across the state while commendable shutting down fraudulent and unscrupulous operators is going to take a while the customer base is large and either unaware or downright afraid of seeking recourse bear in mind those customers are seeking the help to obtain legal status in the united states they are vulnerable because the notarios literally notary who advertise their services are often cheaper than lawyers who specialize in immigration law a notario in some latin american countries is a stateappointed attorney in the us of course a notary public is someone who acts as a legal witness at document signings a notario on this side of the border can make false promises about speeding up the process and guaranteeing an outcome and continue to collect money from the hapless clients who invest hope in them this is a foreseeable problem noted us rep bill foster dill foster introduced legislation that would make it a federal crime to fraudulently offer immigration legal services the bill calls for a fine and up to 10 to 15 years in federal prison for offenders not only do these notarios exploit immigrants for money but their false services can and many times have resulted in wellmeaning immigrants being deported because they didnt receive accurate information on the immigration process foster said its federal legislation that merits support even if the current attempt at immigration reform fizzles perhaps especially if it fizzles immigrants seeking to legally navigate a complicated process deserve the protection these are people who are trying to play by the rules after all but could have their opportunity for legal status compromised by fraudulent advice rendered by unscrupulous con artists the california legislature is also seeking to crack down on fraudulent immigration consultants criminalizing this type of fraud deserves the attention of the texas legislature as well but the next regular session is a year and three months away back in central texas sanchezs lawyer said his client agreed to the settlement because he was tired of fighting the state ed watt of dripping springs blamed sanchezs legal problems on those who opposed the competition at lower rates its an explanation that invites skepticism especially from sanchezs aggrieved clientele a former cristo vive client told the americanstatesman in 2011 that sanchez advised him to seek a religious worker visa instead of applying for political asylum because of threats he had received in his native colombia it was advice that nearly got him deported its as

1994 marked a turning point in the history of immigration to the united states it may mark the beginning of the end of an era dating from the 1960s in which an influx of latino and asian newcomers changed the face of america regardless of what happens on election day in california where illegal immigration has polarized an entire campaign season the political dynamics of the issue have changed irrevocably cracking down on illegal immigrants has been embraced by politicians across the ideological spectrum who now debate only the appropriate means inexorably the status of refugees and legal immigrants have become part of the fray if 1994 is remembered as the year when america began to close its doors then aug 18 will be the date to remember that evening just in time for the 11 pm news on the east coast attorney general janet reno announced that henceforth cuban rafters would be sent to an internment camp on the us naval base at guantanamo bay cubans were once the most privileged immigrants like berlin wall jumpers and russian ballet dancers they were cold war icons for more than 30 years they served as evidence of americas moral superiority then in the summer of 1994 president clinton put cubans behind barbed wire and no one much complained clintons decision may have been prompted by the potential danger to the reelection campaign of florida gov lawton chiles but the groundwork for the decision was laid in response to another governor californias pete wilson a republican and a foe wilson put illegal immigration on the national political agenda by making it the key issue in his reelection effort in an innovative formulation he denounced porous borders as an unfunded federal mandate and demanded that washington make up the losses to his state treasury fearful of the political fallout in a state that is the keystone to his own reelection prospects the president embraced wilsons diagnosis and ordered up his own cure having resisted gop legislation to boost the border patrol in 1993 clinton launched his own initiative as part of the crime bill passed last summer although the administration disputed the amount of money illegal immigration costs states it embraced the logic of reimbursement and began writing checks to sacramento and other state capitals by the time the summer was over however clinton had not only extended the illegal immigration crisis to the cubans but had also broadened the fiscal arguments against immigrants to cover those who are here legally a major financing provision of the welfare reform plan clinton unveiled june 15 involved further limiting legal immigrants alreadyrestricted access to the welfare system the politics of restriction got another boost from an unexpected quarter when the commission on immigration reform headed by former us representative barbara jordan of texas declared that the illegal influx needed urgent attention and proposed the kind of aggressive crackdown that had mostly been advocated by conservative republicans in the past and had never gotten very far in congress immigration advocates complain that jordan perhaps unwittingly provided white liberals african americans and assorted democrats all the political cover they needed to take up a restrictionist agenda jordan and the commission put forward what they thought were carefully crafted proposals and insisted that they were not advocating a national id card but in the current political atmosphere theyve lent credibility to the idea that expensive and potentially intrusive measures are necessary to fight illegal immigration said cecilia munoz chief immigration analyst for the national council of la raza in the heat of the current campaign politicians as ideologically diverse as wilson and sen edward m kennedy dmass have said they favored an identity card plan to prevent illegal immigrants from getting jobs jordan meanwhile has boldly staked her reputation as a civil rights leader on a promise that there would be no harmful effects in terms of civil liberties and discrimination none of this would have been possible except for the fact that immigration legal and illegal is accentuating all kinds of fears in much of the public in the past and in many other countries immigration has often aroused economic insecurities and provoked anxieties about the unknown but in the united states today immigration seems to be hitting several different hot buttons at once most current immigrants are not of european origins and so their growing numbers play into ageold anxieties about race as well as newer debates over issues like multiculturalism because many are poor they heighten taxpayer resentments over social spending because immigration policy is a federal matter the ongoing illegal influx gets tagged as one more sign of washingtons incompetence ragged people heading north in makeshift sea vessels become symbols of a world that is out of control and unresponsive to american imperatives finally all of these factors resonate with the profound but often poorly articulated concerns over the nations identity direction and future that underlie so much political discourse we are in the first stage of the postmodern period of immigration and from now on immigration policy is going to be addressed in a fundamentally different way than in the past says wade henderson chief of the naacps washington office and a longtime power broker on immigration issues the political pressure to do something is building and restrictionist proposals that once seemed far out are now being taken seriously nowhere has that been more evident than in congress during the past session dozens of measures were introduced to further reduce illegal immigrants already very limited access to public benefits to greatly expand the border patrol or to slash the number of visas for legal immigrants the administration together with key democratic leaders managed to squash all the big proposals and by late summer was beginning to develop a legislative initiative for next year rather than just trying to stifle all the action we are going to put out our own proposals in 1995 said a senior administration official for one thing we would not be able to keep a lid on this issue again and for another we want to be in an affirmative posture rather that on the defensive going into the 96 elections reno has already said that the administration will promote measures to combat document fraud and to enhance enforcement of laws prohibiting employment of illegal immigrants it may also seek broader authority to deal with immigration emergencies like the ones that erupted in the caribbean last summer where the legislative proposals will begin is easy to figure where they will end is impossible to predict two major questions of degree remain to be answered how far is the public willing to go in fighting illegal immigration and will the restrictionist impulse carry over into legal immigration producing substantial cuts in the number of people admitted whats been happening with refugees is very much tied to a change in public attitude toward immigration in general said diana aviv director of the washington office of the council of jewish federations all immigrants now tend to be viewed as a financial burden regardless of their contribution and that is because of whats happened in california the socalled save our state initiative on the california ballot outlaws virtually all services to illegal immigrants proposition 187 grew out of wilsons insistence that immigration must be viewed as a fiscal issue and the governor has been its most prominent supporter but cutting costs is only one objective proposition 187 would require public officials to report anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant alan nelson a reaganera immigration official and a coauthor of the initiative said it sends a message to the illegal alien that we will not tolerate their living here against the law and that they should go home opponents which include the states largest teacher school board and medical associations complain that the intent is to make schools and hospitals instruments of immigration policy the goal is to create a climate of fear so the undocumented will leave but inevitably anyone who looks foreign or sounds foreign would come under the shadow of suspicion said scott macdonald spokesman for taxpayers against 187 a coalition of opponents to the measure the jordan commission concluded that for public safety reasons immunizations and a few other services should be provided to illegal immigrants it noted also that efforts to restrict illegal immigrants access to public services should conform to constitutional requirements referring to the 1982 supreme court decision mandating that all children receive a public education regardless of immigration status a decision that proponents of proposition 187 seek to challenge by getting the initiative enacted they had a powerful voice on the ninemember commission in the person of harold ezell a former immigration service official who coauthored the proposition with nelson while serving on jordans panel the commissions most lasting contribution however may lie in a policy formulation that inextricably links legal and illegal immigration into one political package in presenting the commissions report to congress jordan said if we are to preserve our immigration tradition and our ability to say yes to so many of those who seek entry we must also have the strength to say no where we must this rhetoric is loaded with common sense and it has been employed by others including clinton in the past but jordan is the first to justify a massive new program to combat illegal immigration on the basis that it is necessary to preserve the integrity of legal immigration while ms jordan and the commission probably thought that they were reinforcing the distinction between legal and illegal immigration they may have unwittingly contributed to the further blurring of that distinction said demetrios papademetriou senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace jordans report is already being used to justify measures more stringent than those she has envisioned proponents of cutbacks in legal immigration like sen alan simpson r wyo have coined a corollary to her argument if a drastic reduction in illegal immigration is necessary to preserve the integrity of the legal flow as jordan argued then the legal flow should be cut down until there is proof that illegal immigration has been brought under control jordan might not countenance such proposals but that is not going to stop anyone in the superheated atmosphere that surrounds this issue preserving the credibility of the immigration system is the slogan cutting costs is the rationale new limits are the objective illegal immigration will be the initial target but fewer legal

highlight a hot topic this summer its share of the spotlight is uncertain as capitol hills recess ends like a big project that doesnt just go away during vacation the issue of immigration awaits congress when it returns from its summer recess its future is unclear this summer immigration reform appears to have garnered additional support from the republican side of the us house perhaps enough to pass legislation if immigration measures ever get to a full vote activists calling for reform spent august pushing for that move more phone calls more rallies more prayer events and they mostly came from one side as little was heard from opponents some proreform activists hailed it as a success we have seen a lot of momentum throughout the august recess in orange county and across the country said wendy tarr director of the orange county chapter of clergy and laity united for economic justice a faithbased organization part of me is encouraged that when they go back to work legislators will caucus and will have very positive stories about business leaders speaking to them agricultural leaders faith leaders and other people who have worked to communicate with them tarr said rep john campbell rirvine said its been a hot topic this summer in orange county we got more calls on immigration than any other issue he said the congressman received approximately 350 calls and 17 letters in support of immigration reform and about 80 calls and 23 letters expressing concerns about the senatepassed bill andor blanket amnesty said christopher bognanno campbells spokesman in orange county campbell was one of two congressmen targeted by pro immigration reform forces rep ed royce rfullerton was the second royces spokeswoman did not provide any numbers saying their office does not keep such statistics one of the groups coordinating volunteers on calls to campbell and royce was the orange county labor federation volunteers made close to 60000 calls and patched through more than 500 callers to each congressman said julio perez director of the local aflcio organization has this been enough to sway ed royce and john campbell to come out in public support of immigration reform no it hasnt perez said but whats different is that were having longer conversations with people in the past they would last 30 seconds to a minute these conversations last longer they are real conversations not just yes and no answers in an interview friday campbell said he is sympathetic and interested in a pathway to residency but he does not support the senatepassed bill that would allow some 11 million people here illegally the right to become citizens royce said in an email that he wants to work on securing the border first faster documentation for immigrants and a workable employer verification system five immigrationrelated bills have cleared house committees and await consideration by the full chamber none address the controversial proposal adopted by the senate that would create a 13year path to citizenship for people who either came here illegally or arrived with temporary visas and overstayed them according to americas voice a washington dcbased proimmigrant organization 24 house republicans have publicly endorsed citizenship as part of an immigration overhaul when and how the issue will surface for a vote is up to house speaker john boehner rohio who has pledged that he will not break the hastert rule a practice that calls for a bill to be brought to the house floor for a vote only when a majority of the majority supports a measure there is precedent for breaking the rule and house conservatives have warned boehner not to do it with immigration his membership is so angry that he has broken it in the past that they have increased the pressure to not break it again over immigration said doris meissner a senior fellow and director for the us immigration policy program at the migration policy institute a nonpartisan think tank there are other challenges congress has fewer than 50 legislative days before the end of the year and legislators must tackle other serious subjects i do expect syria to be the first priority because its the most urgent campbell said other imminent subjects include government funding and whether to raise the debt limit i would be surprised if we get to immigration before november or december and while immigration is a hotbutton issue in california in other parts of the country health care jobs and the economy are taking prominence before immigration campbell said at town hall meetings across the us last month there was little of the anger voiced over other immigration reform campaigns in previous years on friday sen marco rubio rfla was heckled while giving a speech at a conservative conference

793 of 997 documents st petersburg times florida december 24 1990 monday city edition immigration law sends new signal byline reena shah section national pg 1a length 1939 words keep your tired your poor your huddled masses but give me your phds and millionaires americas new immigration law seems to tell the rest of the world    the new law signed last month by president bush sanctions a 35 percent increase in the number of immigrants starting next year that will allow 700000 people a year to enter america from 1995 the number of immigrants will level off to 675000 a year    the law along with recent changes in canadas immigration law will make possible the immigration of nearly 1million people every year to north america from other parts of the world    the bulk of americas immigrants as always will be relatives of us citizens and residents and that number remains near 500000 a year but theres a new effort to upgrade the quality of newcomers by dramatically increasing the number of visas granted to highly skilled workers and investors the current level of 54000 visas for skilled workers like doctors engineers professors and entrepreneurs will be raised to 140000 a year    the significant change is that there are more visas for immigrants who want to come because they have skills an educational background or the financial capability to offer something to america said duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service ins in washington    until now 90 percent of immigration has been based on family unification austin said    the new law hasnt eroded the idea of bringing together families its just increased the share of others by increasing the overall quota    although a broad limit exists on immigration its a pierceable cap there is no limitation on immediate relatives of american citizens     the new law marks the fourth historic change in americas immigration policy since the nations founding despite americas longstanding image as a cosmopolitan mecca of opportunity its immigration policies have traditionally tried to keep out all but europeans    laws such as the chinese exclusion act were passed to keep out nonwhite immigrants and other people thought equally undesirable prostitutes criminals and the mentally ill    equal opportunity for immigration was granted only in 1965 when the last major change was made that law opened doors to all nations and ethnic groups and instituted family ties as the basis for immigration    the new law upholds family unification as the linchpin of americas immigration policy and for the first time institutes a substantial reward for skilled migrants a system that is already in place in australia and canada to attract qualified citizens       among the visas granted to skilled workers 10000 will be given to investors who are willing to spend at least 1million to set up businesses that create jobs for at least 10 americans    onethird of such visas are to go to people who are willing to locate businesses in rural areas or areas of high unemployment    curiously the aflcio a national federation of workers unions supported the overall increase in immigration but opposed the giving of visas to such job creators its the concept of buying a visa that were against said jane ogrady a legislative assistant    the new law also scraps some older rules one of them a mccarthyera provision the mccarranwalter act has denied even visitor visas to more than 350000 people whom the administration believed were subversive or leftist the list has included novelists graham greene and gabriel garcia marquez and actor yves montand    the earlier law also specifically barred entry to homosexuals polygamists and people with aids but the new law doesnt categorically do so but terrorists spies drug traffickers communists criminals and former nazis are still prohibited from coming into the united states and can be deported       although there is no longer a blanket ban on people with different political beliefs the secretary of state can still deny admission to people whose ideas he decides are dangerous to americas foreign policy    the immigration law also has a new provision that resurrects a preferential quota for immigrants from europe because 85 percent of recent immigrants come from asia latin america and the caribbean to join spouses children or siblings already in the united states the new law has been amended to make immigration easier for people from 38 other countries mostly in europe who may wish to come to america but have no immediate kin in this country to sponsor them    a yearly total of 40000 people from nations such as ireland italy britain germany japan poland albania algeria and venezuela will benefit from this special quota    the largest beneficiaries of this reform are irish for the purpose of immigration under this category ireland and northern ireland will be regarded as separate countries and up to 16000 irish immigrants will be allowed each year under this quota    some citizens of hong kong will also benefit from the new law their annual immigration quota will be raised from 5000 to 10000 a year and hong kong a british crown colony that is to become a part of china in 1997 will be treated as a separate country for purposes of immigration to america    another 12000 visas a year will be granted until 1994 to highlevel executives of large american corporations operating in hong kong to prevent them from emigrating to other nations with liberal immigration policies    the immigration quota doesnt include the 131000 refugees who will also come to america this year mostly from indochina and the soviet union refugees have to prove they have a wellfounded fear of persecution in their countries before they can come to america and live permanently said pam lewis a state department spokeswoman    the changes in immigration law reflect how far americas gatekeeping policies have come since the nation was settled by europe until 1965 it was aimed at excluding entire groups of people based on ethnicity said david ray of the federation for american immigration reform fair in washington his group believes america can absorb no more newcomers and favors halting immigration from all parts of the world    early immigrants to america came from northern and western europe and there were practically no restrictions on their numbers a 1790 law provided that any free white man of good moral character could become a citizen after hed lived in america for more than two years said carl haub a demographer at the population reference bureau a washington research group    but when immigration policies were later crafted they were restrictive the first significant immigration policy was enacted by congress at the end of the 19th century to virtually ban asian particularly chinese immigration after rioters accused chinese laborers of stealing jobs    when the chinese exclusion act was passed in 1882 there were 39000 chinese haub said mostly laborers building americas railroads that was the peak of chinese arrivals at that time but it wasnt that much if you compared it to the 250000 germans who came in the same year subsequent laws kept out immigrants from other asian nations the ban on chinese immigration wasnt lifted until 1943 when china fought on americas side in world war ii    in 1924 another law was enacted to restrict the number of immigrants from southern and eastern europe after studies pointed out such immigrants were racially inferior criminally inclined and didnt assimilate into america haub said that law decreed 82 percent of immigrants could come from northern and western europe and only 16 percent from southern and eastern europe only 2 percent of immigrants could come from the eastern hemisphere but literacy tests not applied to europeans and other prohibitions effectively kept out asians    a landmark change was adopted in 1965 since then national origin has been immaterial anybody who came to america and became a citizen or permanent resident could invite his or her family to also become americans parents spouses children brothers and sisters    today the largest traffic of immigrants comes not from europe but from mexico 20 percent the philippines vietnam korea india china the dominican republic jamaica iran and el salvador    still immigration in the 1980s has broken some records too austin said the legalization of 3million illegal immigrants in 1986 swelled the decades total to 10million in contrast not more than 6million people have immigrated to america in any decade except between 1900 and 1910 when nearly 9million immigrants arrived    and despite the 1986 amnesty there are 4million illegal aliens living in the united states some americans believe that the country can absorb no more newcomers and should drastically reduce or completely halt immigration    this is no longer a nation that is being formed and filled said john vinson an official of the american immigration control foundation in monterey va a group that favors curtailing immigration when you build a house you may need a crew of carpenters and plumbers but once its built you dont need those kinds of services every day of the week    americas population increases by 1 percent every year adding 23million people said haub of the population research group immigration accounts for a quarter of this increase    fair the group that advocates halting immigration maintains that familyoriented quotas have brought in immigrants who are more likely to be unemployed and depend on welfare    the fault isnt in the immigrants but in the way we selected them said ray the groups spokesman we designed a nepotistic system and were paying for it if the immigrants of the 1980s had all been skilled americas national income would be 12billion more every year ray said citing a study    but others say immigration is a part of americas heritage and isnt burdensome past immigrants to america came to seek refuge from causes that were little different they fled poverty persecution and the wars of europe and they were joined by families who were often illiterate and unskilled poverty is no longer accepted as a valid reason for coming to america but new immigrants come to join relatives or have been displaced by fighting in vietnam and central america    the people who come to america have to prove that they or their sponsor can support them and they wont become a charge of the state said haub of the population reference bureau refugees are the only newcomers who depend on social services    the aflcio has always had a proimmigration position said spokeswoman jane ogrady some recent literature has pointed out that americans have spent more on welfare and been displaced by jobs lost to newcomers but illegal immigration is the culprit she said    our view is that all the workers in america are products of immigration ogrady said we all came from somewhere loaddate november 11 1992 language english graphic color graph don morris graph illustrating the major immigration movements

805 of 997 documents the washington post july 23 1988 saturday final edition 1980s expected to set mark as top immigration decade arrivals to us may exceed 9 million byline zita arocha washington post staff writer section first section page a1 length 1796 words immigration to the united states during the 1980s is expected to match or exceed the historic high mark set by the flood of nearly 9 million immigrants who reached american shores in the first decade of the century according to a new study of government statistics the report by the center for immigration studies a research group concluded that the number of legal immigrants between 1981 and 1990 will equal or surpass the 87 million total between 1901 and 1910 if illegal immigrants are included the current total would be several million higher the group found in contrast with the earlier peak which was characterized mainly by unskilled immigrants from europe the new arrivals are primarily of asian and hispanic descent the report said the current wave has rekindled debate over the nations ability to absorb large numbers of immigrants government officials and private immigration specialists said they agreed with the studys findings the immigration in the 80s is very significant because these are historic highs said doris meissner an immigration expert at the carnegie foundation and former acting commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service and we are only now beginning to grapple with how the size and composition of this immigration is going to affect our national life it looks like the numbers will reach 85 million and perhaps even go over the 9 million mark this decade said duke austin an ins spokesman and this will be the first time in the history of the country according to the centers study the current immigration wave will mark the second time the number of arrivals in one decade has surpassed 8 million since 1820 when the government began keeping records the figure for the present decade has been bolstered in part by 24 million immigrants who have sought amnesty under the revised immigration law in the past seven years 4 million legal immigrants were admitted to the united states according to ins statistics officials said 18 million are expected by 1990 if current trends continue the total is expected to reach the 87 million mark with the addition of those granted amnesty along with hundreds of thousands of refugees and other immigrants who have received political asylum and are expected to be granted permanent resident status legal immigrants are people admitted because they have close relatives who are us citizens or residents because they are refugees or have been granted political asylum and have become permanent residents or because they are foreign workers with skills that are in short supply in the united states the influx of immigrants who like their predecessors have come to the united states to escape economic and political instability is expected to have longlasting repercussions on all aspects of american life from business to politics to social institutions experts said the immigrants are leading us toward a less standardized society and making us make adjustments in our cultural and language practices said david simcox executive director of the center for immigration studies in areas where they are settling in disproportionate numbers there is disruption to the economy housing schools and health facilities meissner said and theres been no local planning for this because local governments have not been prepared however thomas espenshade a senior fellow at the urban institute a research group cited research showing that the benefits of immigration probably offset the disadvantages by satisfying the demand for labor and adding variety to the culture theres no doubt that todays immigration is good for the country said rick swartz president of the national immigration refugee and citizenship forum a coalition of church ethnic and legal organizations the diversity of cultures and backgrounds and ethnic heritage is a great source of energy and strength to the american identity the complexity of the issue is revealed by differing attitudes among americans whose parents or grandparents were immigrants joe gentiles grandparents and mother fled fascist italy in the mid1920s gentile 45 a public information officer for the dc police department said he understands how recent immigrants fleeing from political repression and economic problems look to this country and say thats got to be the greatest country in the world and i want to live there steve rosen a 45yearold defense department employee who belongs to a conservative immigration organization is proud he said that his grandparents came from poland and czechoslovakia but he favors stricter controls on immigration the immigration from the turn of the century was largely a continuation of immigration from previous years in that the european stock of america was being maintained he said now we are having a large influx of third world people which could be potentionally disruptive of our whole judeochristian heritage immigration experts said there has always been some antiimmigrant sentiment in the united states at the turn of the century the number of italian greek polish and eastern european immigrants began to overtake the total immigrating from other parts of europe at the time we said the eastern and southern europeans were inferior people said demetrios papademetriou an immigration expert at the us labor department there is an old immigrant saying that goes america beckons but americans repell said alan kraut a history professor at american university the country has always needed and continues to need immigrants to energize us culturally and intellectually and fuel the economy but at the same time americans always feel threatened and are fearful of newcomers concern over the recent wave of immigrants especially hispanics has given rise to an effort to make english the official us language so far 16 states have adopted english as the official language and the issue will be on the ballot in november in three other states population control groups have expressed fears we see immigration as an important part of our overall population picture said donald mann the president of negative population growth inc which has called for limiting immigration levels to 100000 people a year roger conner president of the federation for american immigration reform which lobbies for tighter controls on immigration argued that if high immigration rates continue every major longrange ecological problem will be vastly greater to solve the group also contends that immigrants depress wages and displace us workers but karl zinsmeister a social demographer at the american enterprise institute a conservative group said that although immigrants sometimes depress wages in the long run they are an asset the american formula only works when we are creating new opportunities and expanding horizons he said in such states as california florida texas and new york where immigrants are settling in large concentrations profound shifts are taking place demographers said according to ins statistics almost 70 percent of the immigrants in 1987 settled in those four states along with new jersey and illinois and the six states have been magnets for immigrants for more than 10 years the washington area drew the fifth largest concentration of legal immigrants last year after new york los angeles miamihialeah and chicago officials said leon bouvier a demographer and former vice president of the population reference bureau an information clearinghouse said that although the us population has tripled since the turn of the century immigration now has a greater impact because the fertility rate is much lower within the next 20 to 25 years whites will become a minority in california texas and new york as the result of immigration by asians and hispanics he said to me thats a dramatic shift and rather than hide it lets talk about it and get these people to fit into the economy according to a recent study by bouvier the six states where the majority of immigrants have settled had 16 more congressional seats in 1980 than they would have had if the immigrants had not settled there between 1950 and 1980 california gained six seats through immigration and florida gained two the shift of seats to immigrationheavy states is likely to accelerate in the next three decades as immigration remains high and the countrys natural increase continues to slow bouvier said at the turn of the century when the united states needed unskilled and semiskilled workers and there were few restrictions on immigration 85 percent of the immigrants were from eastern or western europe officials said in contrast almost 85 percent of the recent immigrants are from asia or latin america with europeans accounting for only about 11 percent of the total the shift has occurred because of an increasing number of refugee admissions and changes in immigration law officials said the revisions lifted restrictions against immigration from asia and gave preference to foreigners with close relatives in the united states rather than those with skills in short supply here last year for example of 601516 immigrants to the united states 430384 were admitted because they were family members of us citizens or residents about 96000 were refugees or people who had been granted political asylum and who had become permanent residents only about 50000 were admitted because of employment skills in an attempt to address that imbalance the senate this year passed a bill that would allow more immigrants into the country for occupational reasons and raise the yearly limit on the overall number of immigrants a similar measure has been introduced in the house experts said immigration levels are likely to remain high during the 1990s as immigrants who are already here try to bring their family members and as economic conditions in latin america and some asian countries are considered likely to deteriorate i think in the the 90s the us will continue to be a very inviting place for immigrants simcox said he cited two factors that will act as a magnet to attract immigrants the established immigrant network and expected labor shortages in some sectors of the economy david north an immigration scholar who works for transcentury inc a study group here agreed this continues to be an attractive place to live and people come here because they feel they can get a better life that was true at the turn of the century and it probably will be true at the turn of the next

d1 length 1511 words immigration law once shunned as a backwater of the legal profession is being transformed into a respected field mainly because of the growing impact of immigrants on us businesses and changing federal immigration policies signs of this newfound respectability can be seen in the courtship of immigration specialists by prominent law firms in washington and elsewhere the number of major law schools now offering immigration law courses and the dramatic increase in lawyers chosing to become immigration practitioners from foreign policy questions to civil rights concerns immigration law is drawing a new breed of idealistic young lawyers who are challenging the government on such issues as the treatment of haitian boat people and the right of salvadorans to petition for political asylum in the past the common perception was that immigration lawyers worked out of storefronts and were sleazeballs said attorney michael maggio who practices immigration law with his wife candace kattar and two other lawyers in dupont circle but that is changing now because immigration touches so many people and other lawyers are turning to immigration lawyers for advice he said david crosland a dc lawyer who heads the general practice committee on immigration law of the american bar association agrees that the negative stereotype of immigration lawyers is becoming a thing of the past ten years ago the reputation of immigration lawyers was less savory said crosland former acting commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service now i see that changing and more lawyers are getting into the area part of the reason for the nowfavorable image lies in the increasing connection of business and immigration as us employers seek to bring in skilled foreign workers and as multinational companies try to set up businesses here many immigration lawyers have expanded their practice beyond helping undocumented maids and cooks obtain socalled green cards to assisting large corporations bring in foreign managers engineers and computer technicians immigration law has become an important consideration in effectively doing business in the us both for companies here and for those abroad that want to do business here said stanley mailman a new york lawyer who has practiced immigration law for 33 years the 1986 immigration law which established a oneyear amnesty program for illegal aliens is contributing to the changing attitude toward immigration lawyers under the law employers are assessed fines for hiring illegal workers or failing to keep proper work records on all employees many employers are turning to immigration lawyers for help the practice is becoming increasingly employeroriented and increasingly complicated said maggio who counts among his clients several hotels and small businesses in the dc area and hightech companies in south carolina and ohio the impact of employer sanctions refugee policies and the bringing in of skilled foreign workers were at the top of the agenda of the american immigration lawyers association recently during the 42yearold professional organizations annual meeting in san diego about 900 people the largest turnout in the history of the association attended the gathering which drew top ins state department and department of labor officials the ins presence at the conference was viewed as an indication that the agency has modified its oncenegative attitude toward immigration lawyers charlie gordon 82 worked for ins for 35 years as an examiner and later as general counsel until he retired in 1974 and went into private practice as an immigration lawyer in the past ins officials thought the lawyers were interlopers that when the lawyers came in with a case they were to be suspected he said although ins and lawyers still are adversaries gordon said their relationship today is much more cordial now ins officials meet regularly with immigration lawyers association members to share information and sometimes to seek approval for its proposals on immigration reform gordon said the association started in 1946 by a small group of new york lawyers who previously had worked for ins this year claims about 2900 members it has developed over the past four or five years from a provincial northeastern organization to a national organization with a broad range of practitioners said ira kurzban a miami lawyer and outgoing president of the association in addition to staying abreast of developments in immigration law the group lobbies for changes in immigration and has a program of offering free legal service to immigrants and refugees association executive director warren leiden said that about 300 law schools now offer courses in immigration law compared with just a few 10 years ago increasingly permanent faculty members at the major law schools are teaching immigration law past practice was to let adjunct professors teach the course law school officials said peter schauk a professor at yale university law school said enrollment in his immigration law course has grown from about 17 students to 51 in the past two years theres a growing sense that immigration law can be lucrative especially because increasingly major law firms are offering immigration law specialty to their clients schauk said at the university of virginia law school professor david martin has taught an immigration course since 1982 and next year he plans to teach a seminar on refugee law he said some of his students have gone on to practice immigration law at corporate firms or public interest firms that do pro bono work the real sign that immigration is catching on as an important subject is that a lot of law schools that are not in major immigration areas like virginia are offering an immigration law course said martin who is chairman of the immigration law section of the american association of law schools larger traditional law firms are establishing immigration departments a departure from the past practice of farming out immigration cases to immigration experts or turning them over to less experienced associates in the firm because the focus of immigration law in the past has been on individual foreignborn clients who were seeking a legal means of remaining in this country many immigration lawyers are sole practitioners or work with a few other lawyers their offices for the most part are small and homey with pictures of smiling immigrants or folk art on the walls but some of the largest law firms are moving to include immigration law departments as they seek a competitive advantage over rival firms lawyers said other firms have felt compelled to hire immigration experts as their corporate clients have begun to demand advice on complex immigration matters i dont know of a seasoned immigration lawyer who is in his own practice who hasnt had a conversation with a major law firm in the last 12 months about coming in leiden said theres a lot of courtship going on five years ago lynda zengerle did not like to concede that she practiced immigration law i had heard too many horror stories about people paying a lot of money and getting ripped off and felt it was a practice i couldnt be proud of she said but that has changed for zengerle who two weeks ago became a partner at the downtown law firm of arent fox kintner plotkin kahn where she has been head of the immigration department for three years its a sign of the firms commitment to immigration law zengerle said of her promotion for more than 10 years attorney paul schmidt was an ins employee serving for a while as deputy general counsel and then for about a year as acting general counsel a year ago however he left the goverment and joined the downtown law firm jones day reavis pogue the second largest law firm in the country before schmidt joined the firm one lawyer was doing immigration work part time now it has a fullfledged immigration section with five attorneys the firm started to see the interplay between international law tax law labor law and immigration law schmidt said i think the time is coming when every major law firm is going to have to have this capacity he added h ronald klasko the new president of the immigration lawyers association recently moved from a mediumsize philadelphia firm of 85 lawyers to the international law firm of dechert price rhoads with 200 lawyers in its philadelphia office with him went two associates two paralegals and an administrative secretary ive been in the field for 10 years and the way the profession has changed has been mindboggling he said but klasko still worries that the negative image many people have of immigration lawyers has not necessarily caught up with the reality and he hopes that the association can launch a public relations program in the next year to help change the stereotype language english graphic photo the immigration law team at the firm of arent fox kintner plotkin kahn includes seated from left vivane

206 of 997 documents us official news august 30 2013 friday arizona hr 2002 length 1265 words dateline phoenix office of the legislative the state of arizona has issued the following bill a resolution supporting reasonable and humane principles for comprehensive immigration reform text of bill begins on next page whereas the federal government has the exclusive authority to develop implement and enforce immigration policy under the united states constitution the regulation of immigration is solely the responsibility of the federal government and the courts have consistently applied this principle to mandate federal preemption of state and local efforts to regulate immigration moreover the enactment of immigration laws by state and local governments such as arizonas senate bill 1070 produces an incoherent and inconsistent patchwork of policies that undermine the effective enforcement of federal immigration policy and whereas comprehensive immigration reform must strengthen our national security and the public safety of our communities and neighborhoods the united states has the right of every sovereign nation to secure its borders through laws that regulate the entry of persons from other countries we must provide resources for immigration enforcement and implement enforcement measures that will accomplish these goals in an effective and humane manner the implementation of resources must be used in accordance with respect to human and civil rights in addition policymakers must not impose ineffective or unrealistic requirements for the achievement of immigration enforcement goals as a precondition to implementing the other components of comprehensive immigration reform and whereas comprehensive immigration reform must provide immigrant workers and their families with an opportunity to pursue united states citizenship currently there are millions of immigrants who have been here for several years and who pay taxes raise families and contribute to their communities including many who do not yet have authorized immigration status it is essential that our immigration policy recognizes the contributions of these community members by providing an opportunity to obtain legal permanent residency and eventually a path to united states citizenship through a program with fair and reasonable requirements and whereas comprehensive immigration reform policies must help reunite families and reduce immigration backlogs currently large immigration backlogs prevent many united states citizens from swiftly reuniting with their family members it is important that our immigration policies recognize the efforts of individuals who have petitioned for loved ones through legal channels and that we institute measures to ensure family reunification and a substantive reduction of the family backlogs and whereas any temporary worker program must provide workers with full labor and civil rights protections and the opportunity to pursue legal permanent residency in the united states comprehensive immigration reform must seek to improve the conditions for migrant and seasonal workers many of whom work in agricultural jobs if these conditions are addressed through a temporary worker program it must provide labor and wage protections and an opportunity for workers to pursue legal permanent residency in particular we must provide temporary workers with full labor and civil rights including the right to organize the right to change jobs and the right to remain with their families and must vigorously enforce these rights and whereas comprehensive immigration reform must provide a meaningful opportunity for immigrant students to pursue a college education and the passing of the dream act must be central to any legislation currently thousands of undocumented immigrant students that were brought to the united states at a young age face significant barriers when they try to obtain a postsecondary education these students many of whom excelled in high school lack access to the financial aid and employment opportunities needed to pursue higher education these students are an important part of our future workforce and their pursuit of higher education will make our nation more productive and competitive in the global economy and whereas immigration policies must actively promote the civic integration of migrants many migrants face significant barriers when the attempt to acquire the skills needed to participate in our nations civic life those who wish to pursue english language learning ell and civics instruction often face waiting lists or crowded classrooms comprehensive immigration reform provides a critical opportunity to promote ell and civics instruction and make more resources available for adult education services further immigration policies must ensure that the naturalization process is fair and accessible for all we oppose any efforts that would create unfair obstacles for naturalization applicants including high application fees or other costs that put united states citizenship beyond the reach of middle and lowincome legal permanent residents we also oppose measures that would jeopardize the due process rights of applicants or make unfair changes in the english and civics proficiency requirements for united states citizenship and whereas our nations security and public safety are best protected by effective and fair immigration enforcement measures our immigration enforcement policies must not diminish the due process rights afforded to our nations residents including united states citizens legal permanent residents or undocumented individuals and whereas we oppose measures that make undocumented presence in the united states a crime including measures that would make millions of undocumented individuals into criminals and virtually prevent them from ever obtaining legal permanent residence in the united states our nation would be required to expend a significant amount of resources to carry out these measures including the deployment of enforcement officials prosecutors judges and courtappointed counsel and the expansion of detention facilities ultimately measures that criminalize undocumented presence cannot be fully enforced and our nation would squander resources that could be better used for pressing public safety and security concerns and whereas we oppose the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agencies many of these agencies have worked hard to establish relationships of trust with local immigrant communities which is undermined by immigration enforcement activities as a result community members are fearful of reporting crimes or cooperating with local police preventing law enforcement from obtaining the information they need to solve crimes combat terrorism and keep our communities and neighborhoods safe and whereas comprehensive immigration reform must include a discussion of the fundamental cause of migration to the united statesthe need for sustainable social and economic development in the communities where migrants originate our nation must more actively pursue partnership opportunities with sending nations to determine feasible development strategies that would enable them to better meet the economic needs of their population therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives of the state of arizona that the members of the house of representatives support the principles stated in this resolution as a reasonable and humane approach to

malarek gam length 789 words by victor malarek the globe and mail despite assurances from canadas two immigration ministers central american refugee claimants who are returned to the united states to await an immigration hearing in canada have no guarantees that they will not be deported both employment and immigration minister benoit bouchard and gerry weiner secretary of state for immigration said last week that the united states had agreed not to deport the refugee claimants and to allow them to remain until their inquiry date in canada however alan nelson commissioner of the us immigration and naturalization service said in a letter to james bissett canadas executive director of immigration that individuals found to be deportable would be handled under normal us immigration procedures in the letter obtained by the globe and mail mr nelson offered no guarantees that salvadorean or guatemalan refugee claimants sent back from canada would not be deported mr nelson said that if an alien is statutorily eligible for voluntary departure from the united states the district directors will decide at their discretion on a case by case basis when to effect such a departure he said that the departure may be set to coincide with the date that the aliens inquiry is scheduled in canada mr nelson stressed that individuals will be immediately taken into custody and removed if they have been previously processed for deportation have a criminal record or if there is derogatory information mr weiner said in a telephone interview from montreal yesterday that though the agreement between us and canadian immigration officials is not ironclad he believes the americans will respect the arrangement and make sure refugee claimants are available for their hearing in canada it is clearly in the interest of the united states to cooperate he said that his officials will closely monitor the situation and if we feel that people are not available for our inquiry then we will take other measures mr bissett said in an interview that canadian immigration officers at various border points have been instructed not to return anyone to the united states who is under threat of deportation on the weekend more than 300 central americans indicating their intention to claim refugee status at canadian border crossings were returned to the united states until immigration inquiries can be scheduled six were allowed to remain when it was learned that they were previously ordered deported by us immigration mr bissett said however mr bissett said canadian immigration officers are returning all refugee claimants with a criminal record or where there is derogatory information even though mr nelsons letter says they will be deported asked what derogatory information means mr bissett said he interpreted it as a case of national security several refugee advocates accused the government and in particular mr weiner of misleading the public into thinking that a firm international agreement was in place protecting claimants sent back to the united states lorne waldman a toronto immigration lawyer argued that the socalled agreement doesnt apply any protection and is left up to the discretion of us immigration officers its quite clear that mr weiner has misled the canadian public in an effort to justify the governments draconian measures to keep refugees from getting into the country mr waldman said mr weiner should reexamine the socalled agreements make sure real guarantees are in place and until we can get those guarantees the minister should rescind the policy he announced with mr bouchard on friday katherine rimar a us lawyer and law professor in buffalo ny said her information from refugee groups in buffalo is that every refugee claimant at the peace bridge is being sent back without any screening they are not being asked if they are under a deportation order in the us however james campbell director of enforcement and control for the canadian immigration departments ontario region said every case returned to the united states must first be checked with us immigration officials to determine if they will guarantee that the salvadorean or guatemalan claimants will be able to return to canada for their inquiry if there is any doubt we will not ship them back meanwhile a major backlog is developing in quebec and ontario with immigration inquiries now being scheduled into midapril three of the busiest border crossings fort erie niagara falls and windsor have two immigration adjudication officers assigned to handle the entire load mr bissett said the department is monitoring the situation and will be meeting soon to decide whether to bolster our adjudication staff loaddate january 4 2007 language english

mkoestlerkramerlevincom with questions about this interview editor would each of you gentlemen tell our readers something about your background and experience ruthizer we recently joined kramer levin with our entire business immigration group i have been practicing business immigration law a somewhat esoteric specialty for over 25 years for the past ten years i have taught immigration law at columbia law school which is something i enjoy very much at one point i was a name partner in a boutique firm then i became head of the immigration groups of two major law firms i am very active in immigration bar activities and have served as both president and general counsel of the american immigration lawyers association koestler i joined teds practice some ten years ago and i have also been active in the american immigration lawyers association i just finished my term as chair of the organizations new york chapter and id like to note that the other members of the group also have solid backgrounds in immigration law special counsel naomi schorr is a widely read and quoted immigration law author and has almost 20 years of experience in the field senior associate matthew dunn is the current chair of the american immigration lawyers association new york chapter and is a former ins assistant district counsel jennifer raiola danzo has practiced in the field of business immigration for more than ten years and andrew blau a second year associate rounds out the group editor ted you mentioned immigration law as an esoteric specialty how did you come to it ruthizer i really fell into immigration law by chance in the mid1970s i was engaged in appellate work i joined a small firm that handled labor law matters and in addition an unusual specialty involving business immigration matters very few firms did this kind of work my initial interest was in the employment law part of the practice but as time went on i became increasingly drawn to the immigration work i found it both fascinating and challenging it also provided me with an opportunity to help people in a very direct way i found the personal interaction very rewarding i think i was someone who found himself in the right place at the right time koestler by the time i came along business immigration law was a specialty that was already well recognized and growing in importance ted gave me the opportunity to join him in this area and we have worked together ever since editor you have both been engaged in this practice for a considerable time will you tell us how it has evolved over the years have the issues you have addressed changed ruthizer over the years i have seen several major changes one concerns the way in which the immigration laws are administered when i began almost everything was done at the local level most cases were handled at local immigration service offices scattered across the country and to a very large extent who you knew at those offices was as important as what you knew about the law fortunately this has changed dramatically virtually all of the business immigration cases that we handle are adjudicated at one of four remote regional service centers the agency now renamed us immigration and citizenship services has a higher degree of professionalism than it had in the past and this makes a business immigration lawyers knowledge of the law paramount the other major developments have been sweeping changes in the law over the past 10 years an increasing restrictiveness by immigration officials in granting benefits and the challenge of interpreting the meaning of these statutory and policy changes the increasing complexity of the field has made the practice of immigration law a minefield for the unwary and the uninformed another major change of course has been the security controls that have been put into place since september 11 making it far more difficult for foreign nationals to obtain visas and to be admitted to the united states editor where is this particular practice concentrated in the large global firms in boutiques what is the ideal platform for this type of practice koestler there was a time when business immigration law was concentrated for the most part in boutiques today the most effective platform for this type of practice is the large general practice firm one with expertise across many different practice areas business immigration law interfaces with a great many other areas in the law and an ability to draw upon the resources of a large sophisticated general practice firm such as kramer levin is a great advantage editor you are bringing a very experienced practice group to kramer levin how did you choose kramer levin as the new home for the group ruthizer we identified kramer levin as being the best fit for the nature of our practice because kramer levin has such a strong employment law practice as well as many other practice areas that are supportive of what our group does as mark indicates the synergies are there and not only with the employment law practice but also with an entire battery of disciplines that contribute to an effective business immigration practice including corporate tax employee benefits and other areas that interface with our practice and not only is kramer levin a very strong presence here in new york it has an international dimension through its paris office and its strong affiliations with two prominent uk and italian law firms that will help our practice grow it is the right platform for us and we believe we will flourish here editor please tell us about the work of the practice group for starters does the group have its own client base or is it providing a service to the firms clients koestler we bring a terrific client base of our own to kramer levin and we have already begun servicing kramer levin clients who previously had to go elsewhere for this work the groups clients include a number of major communications and media companies many of the countrys leading advertising agencies and a wide range of financial services manufacturing publishing and consumer products companies the entertainment business is also well represented the client base is quite varied and we expect to add to it both new clients and new types of clients as we move into the kramer levin fold editor how big is the group and how does it operate ruthizer we are twelve people altogether with six lawyers with kramer levins reputation and resources we certainly expect the group to continue to grow every lawyer in the group is a business immigration lawyer and every lawyer is closely involved with each case we do we reject the idea that immigration work can be handled by paralegals with only minimal lawyer involvement that is a recipe for disaster and that is the one thing that really distinguishes us from other immigration practices we are also very selective of the kinds of matters we undertake we concentrate exclusively on business immigration and that concentration and our style of practice enable us to provide the best possible representation to our clients editor you are dealing with a number of governmental agencies on an ongoing basis are these relationships part of the value your group brings to its clients ruthizer we deal with a number of governmental agencies the uscis the state department and the labor department and it is simply a fact of life that being able to get to the right person to review a decision we believe is incorrect or to reexamine a policy that violates the spirit or language of a statute or regulation is important to our clients we are a known quantity in governmental circles enjoying a reputation for high quality work and for our knowledge of the law and of the policy and decisionmaking processes we believe strongly in engaging in a wide variety of activities such as lecturing and writing participating in meetings with key governmental officials and being active in the leading professional associations that contribute to our having credibility with the governmental agencies involved in the immigration process editor would you tell us about the challenges that your group faces i am thinking in particular of the postseptember 11 climate koestler since september 11 security background checks are much tighter that means that lengthy governmental delays are now the order of the day and this requires us to do much more advance planning and to make our clients understand that the days when someone could drop into a us consulate without an appointment and walk out a few minutes later with a visa are long gone ruthizer as a consequence of tighter security following september 11 we are dealing with issues of people who might have run afoul of the law in some minor way decades ago and with a record now in the immigration database finding their ability to enter the united states challenged a senior business executive who was arrested for a very minor charge 25 years earlier will now find himself denied entry and literally turned away at the airport these are things that simply did not happen in the past the postseptember 11 climate has made the need for skilled immigration counsel that much more critical editor and the opportunities in a world in which globalization appears to be accelerating your practice is only going to become more important over time ruthizer talent is found all over the world and the search for talent is only going to intensify with globalization in order to compete effectively companies need to recruit and retain that talent wherever it originates it is that talent that drives the engine of the global economy but at the same time globalization of the workforce is a hard concept to sell to congress and business immigration remains a stepchild abandoned by politicians who blame unemployment on the hiring of a modest number of highly qualified foreign national professionals executives and managers our practice group is well positioned to help companies compete in this challenging environment loaddate october 27 2004 language english graphic photo ted ruthizer photo mark d koestler

cabm104 eds a new approach ap video with ap photos by jacques billeaud associated press phoenix » the united states could see an official aboutface in the coming months in how it confronts illegal immigration supreme court justices weighing arguments over arizonas tough immigration law seemed to find little problem wednesday with provisions that require police to check the legal status of people they stop for other reasons over the last several years states frustrated with the countrys porous borders have rejected the longheld notion that washington is responsible for confronting illegal immigration they passed laws to enable local police to address the problem if the court upholds those parts of arizonas law the ruling would codify that type of local enforcement and open the door to such tactics in states with similar laws such as alabama georgia indiana south carolina and utah i think youll see more involvement by local police in immigration enforcement an involvement that hadnt previously been seen said kevin johnson law school dean at the university of californiadavis and an immigration law expert a federal judge put parts of the arizona law on hold shortly before they were to take effect in july 2010 other states followed with similar legislation and combined with other state immigration laws and an ailing economy played a part in tens of thousands of illegal immigrants moving elsewhere if you want to turn around this invasion then you should do attrition through enforcement said former state sen russell pearce architect of the 2010 law and the driving force behind other arizona immigration laws arizona has argued it pays a disproportionate price for illegal immigration because of its 370mile border with mexico and its role as the busiest illegal entry point into the country the obama administration said the law conflicts with a more nuanced federal immigration policy that seeks to balance national security law enforcement foreign policy human rights and the rights of lawabiding citizens and immigrants during arguments over the law liberal and conservative justices reacted skeptically to the administrations argument that the state exceeded its authority when it made the records check and another provision allowing suspected illegal immigrants to be arrested without a warrant civil rights groups say arizonas and the other states measures encourage racial profiling and ethnic stereotyping immigrant rights advocates who believed the courts would reject attempts by states to grab more law enforcement power were not expecting the justices response they said a supreme court validation of the law would frighten immigrants further and cause latinos who are in the country legally to be asked about their status the crisis here in arizona would only multiply said carlos garcia organizer of an immigration march that drew several hundred people in downtown phoenix on wednesday authorities said at least nine people were arrested for blocking a street and refusing to move it would mean that anyone as they are leaving their home whether they are going to work to church wherever they are going could be asked for their documents he said the courts comments surprised state officials and had thus far lost all major court battles over the law arizona attorney general tom horne whose office has helped defend the law predicted the court will uphold the law because many of its provisions mirror existing federal laws he said a year from now the state will see even less illegal immigration you wont see anything that noticeable as far as law enforcement goes horne said but you will see less people sneaking across the border it was unclear what the court would do with other aspects of the law that have been put on hold by lower federal courts the other blocked provisions make it a state crime for immigrants not to have immigration registration papers and for illegal immigrants to seek work or hold a job peter spiro a tempe university law professor who specializes in immigration law predicted the court would uphold the police check of immigration status in arizonas law but said he wouldnt be surprised if the court threw out a provision making it a crime to be without immigration documents such a ruling would let police question people about their immigration status if they have good reason to do so but police would have to call federal authorities to see if they would want to pick up anyone found to be in the country illegally if federal agents decline officers would have to release the person unless they were suspected of committing crimes spiro said if that happened the law would be mostly symbolic but would still carry some significance for immigrants spiro said it would make it clear

american progress has issued the following news release while members of congress are back home for the august recess advocates are mobilizing their constituents across the country to demand that congress pass immigration reform with a road map to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the united states in march cap chronicled the efforts of the faith community to push for sensible immigration legislation the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender or lgbt community has also joined business faith and law enforcement leaders organized labor the technology industry and numerous other socialjustice groups to advocate for commonsense immigration reform lgbt groups are organizing to support immigration reform because they believe that immigration reform is also an lgbt issue while the supreme courts june decision to repeal section 3 of the defense of marriage act or doma provided relief for lgbt binational couples tens of thousands of lgbt immigrants are still in need of relief a study by the williams institute estimates that there are more than 267000 adults in the united states living at the intersection of two marginalized groupsthe lgbt population and the undocumented population fortunately multiple organizations are continuing to work on behalf of this vulnerable group below are three lgbt organizations that are supporting nationwide bipartisan efforts in the fight for immigration reform national center for transgender equality transgender immigrants face numerous kinds of discrimination under our nations current immigration system in immigration detention facilities for example transgender detainees are routinely denied access to hormone treatment subjected to abuse and discrimination from guards and fellow detainees and often placed in solitary confinement in a misguided effort to separate them from the general detainee population and protect them from abuse moreover transgender asylum applicants also face challenges in the asylum system for one thing they are at risk of having their cases dismissed if they do not conform to stereotypes of how transgender people look or behave they are also at risk of being ineligible for asylum because of the oneyear filing deadline while many people are familiar with political asylum many individuals do not know that fear of persecution on the basis of gender identity is grounds for asylum in the united states and they may not learn this within a year of their arrival in light of the mistreatment of transgender immigrants the national center for transgender equality or ncte listed immigration reform as one of its 13 goals for 2013 ncte is also publishing a report on transgender peoples experiences in immigration enforcement to illustrate why immigration reform is critical for the community when asked why ncte is prioritizing immigration reform jessica jeanty a postgraduate law fellow with ncte replied trans people are disproportionately impacted by problems with the immigration system ranging from access to asylum to profiling in enforcement there is a tremendous amount of discrimination and violence in the system a pathway to citizenship is important because trans citizens and noncitizens alike need to be able to work care for their families and have basic protections so they can live decent lives as part of nctes focus on immigration reform it joined with other transgender service and advocacy organizations in a statement of principles to support commonsense immigration reform the organization also brought more than 100 people to capitol hill in june to advocate for immigration reform and the employment nondiscrimination act a bill that would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity to facilitate the mobilization of its members and allies during the august recess ncte launched an august recess action center to give members the tools they need to actively support immigration reform these tools include tips for scheduling meetings with members of congress as well as an interactive map to find local town halls so that ncte members can ask their senators and representatives to protect transgender people in the workplace and reform our broken immigration system the action center also has a submission form for people to share stories of transgender immigrants impacted by immigration law on account of their gender identity the personal and oftenpainful stories put a face to the issue and drive home the need for reform among policymakers and their constituents in addition to the action center ncte is organizing statelevel grassroots efforts with advocates in key congressional districts who plan to encourage their representatives to support immigration reform national queer asian pacific islander alliance as detailed in caps march report living in dual shadows analysis from the williams institute found that lgbt undocumented immigrants are more likely than nonlgbt undocumented immigrants to be asian given this fact it is not surprising that the national queer asian pacific islander alliance or nqapia is spending the august recess

equality continues its direct service work representing asylum seekers fleeing antilgbt brutality around the world and remains actively engaged in efforts to pass compassionate and comprehensive immigration reform the organization continues to fight for the equal treatment of lgbt immigrants and will push congress to reform immigration law to benefit all immigrants especially vulnerable

850 of 997 documents whittier daily news california may 28 2010 friday some say california immigration policy is comparable to new arizona law byline by sandra emerson staff writer section news length 994 words debate over arizonas new immigration law has raised questions about californias immigration policy similar wording in the laws has caused some experts to question the call from california cities and individuals to boycott arizona although they agree that the laws have some similarities there tends to be disagreement on the differences in the laws everybody is trying to say that we have a law just like arizonas law and it really isnt it has similarities but the differences are pretty extraordinary said tim donnelly a republican candidate in the 59th district assembly race and founder of the minuteman civil defense corps of california donnellys biggest quarrel with the comparison of the laws is that californias policy allows police to inquire about a persons legal status and call us immigration and customs enforcement arizonas law allows police to arrest and detain a person suspected of being in the country illegally however californias policy is not enforced due to political reasons donnelly said the ice agent might want to come down there and pick up and deport those suspected to be illegally in the country but theyre not allowed by their superiors he said so thats really where the problem is its not with the agents in the field unlike california policy arizonas law addresses sanctuary cities and allows citizens to sue the government for not enforcing immigration laws the wording of arizonas law is much stronger than californias which has led pitzer college professor jose calderon and other latino activists to lobby against the arizona law calderon who teaches sociology and chicano studies at the college in claremont said the way the laws are written there is a difference between police cooperation in checking for immigration status i think thats why there is such a clamor about it calderon said it allows police officers to question anyone they suspect of being an undocumented immigrant and makes it a state crime to be in the state illegally lori haley a public affairs officer for us immigration and customs enforcement said ice works with local law enforcement through various initiatives but agencies tend to have their own policies agencies have their own policies and we represent that haley said we have our job to do and we do it and try to work as best we can with what the local police do the ice section 287g program authorizes the secretary of the us department of homeland security to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to allow designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions the san bernardino county sheriffs department has implemented the program in its jails to identify criminal illegal immigrants said cindy beavers sheriffs spokeswoman theres a whole series of questions that are asked to every single person who is booked into our facilities and during that time their legal status in the us may come into question beavers said at that point an inmates paperwork is flagged and forwarded to an official with us immigration and customs enforcement who would interview the inmate to determine whether or not he should be taken before an immigration judge beavers said the departments implementation of 287g is the extent of its immigration enforcement beavers said if we stop somebody whether its a traffic stop or for some criminal activity we dont question what their immigration status is beavers said were not immigration officers and sheriff rod hoops made that clear to all of his deputies since january 2006 the program has identified more than 70000 individuals mostly in jails who are suspected of being in the country illegally according to ice there are 71 active agreements to use the program and more than 1120 officers have been trained and certified the los angeles county sheriffs department does not check for immigration status while on patrol but it does assist the us immigration and customs enforcement by interviewing inmates to be released from county jails sheriffs spokesman steve whitmore said if theyre going to be released from the county jail we interview foreignborn inmates and give that information to ice its random and its not an exact science whitmore said however he said that all gang members are interviewed to determine their immigration status before they are released the los angeles county sheriffs department has also implemented the 287g program in its jails congressman gary miller rbrea said the boycott of arizona being pursued by the city of los angeles is hypocritical they come back to washington dc every year wanting 100 million a year to incarcerate illegal immigrants he said they want to go make this statement but then want the federal government to pick up the cost of incarcerating the illegals in jails you cant have it both ways you want to be a sanctuary city but want the federal government to pick up the cost calderon said the expansion of 287g in riverside and san bernardino counties is giving law enforcement more authority to do work that should be left to the federal government there have been many instances where theyve lead to arbitrary arrests for minor offenses where due process rights are violated calderon said not only will the federal government have the ability to enforce immigration laws in arizona but local and state authorities will be able to he said nowhere in the arizona law does it define what is the criteria that you would use in terms of having reasonable suspicion to stop people just to stop and question them on their immigration status calderon said that is really far different than what is written in the california policy and really opens it up for state and local police just to stop anyone on the

tom kisken ventura county star calif section state and regional news length 1081 words feb 2the punches keep coming from both sides but the slugfest over immigration may be losing some of its urgency as activists try to ratchet up pressure on president barack obama to halt deportations and work on comprehensive immigration reform political experts predict he wont take dramatic action anytime soon because of the economy the war and need for healthcare reform a poll by the pew hispanic center suggests that even latinos are pushing immigration down their list of priorities the december survey of 1007 latinos nationwide said only one in three people identified immigration as an extremely important issue on a list of the nations most pressing issues that was led by the economy and followed by education healthcare national security and the environment immigration ranked sixth immigration is very important but its not as important as stabilizing the economy and the leadership of the country said julio gomez a real estate agent from oxnard who sees immigration protests as more of a reminder than a call for immediate action dont let politicians forget about it gomez who was born in ecuador is a citizen who legally came to the us in 1987 activist still seeks changes alicia flores director of hermandad mexicana community center and advocacy group in oxnard contends some of the latinos who are pushing immigration down their list of priorities are third and fourthgeneration immigrants she said theyre buffered from the daily injustices of immigration enforcement deported parents separated from their children and young adults who cant go to college because theyre not eligible for financial aid flores helped to organize a drive in which 5000 ventura county residents signed a letter to president obama urging his support for immigration reform they asked for an immediate halt to deportation and workplace raids the latino community overwhelmingly came out in support of your candidacy the letter reads flores attended obamas inauguration shivering in the washington dc cold with more than 1 million other people the next day she carried an immigration reform sign at a rally aimed at the new president obama said on the day he won the election im not going to do the change you have to do the change said flores who believes applying pressure is the way to make sure change happens many immigration activists say providing a path to legal residency would help the economy by reducing the illegal immigrants who are compensated in cash and dont pay taxes flores director of the hermandad mexicana advocacy group in oxnard thinks reform will spur spending through a domino effect as simple as enabling illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses and buy cars and insurance some want all immigration slowed but as groups like the league of united latin american citizens say they want comprehensive reform on the table within three months others cite the economy as justification for stopping the flow of illegal immigration it seems to me if american labor is hurting the single best way to get americans back to work is to tighten up the labor market said michael lief a ventura lawyer who advocates more enforcement of existing immigration laws that happens by not bringing millions of foreign citizens into the job market to compete with unemployed americans a group called numbersusa is pushing obama to take what it calls a timeout not only on illegal immigration but also on the flow of people who come here legally how can it make any sense for the american peoples own government to be approving more competitors for a dwindling number of jobs the groups leader roy beck said in a letter to obama groups courting the new presidents favor are trying to capitalize on the theory that obama will have a honeymoon period that enhances his ability to push through legislation said tom hogenesch political science professor at csu northridge their battle is to get to the top of the queue said hogenesch who thinks the economy will push the issue to a backburner professor says obama needs a win kareem crayton political science professor at usc said obama wants to build momentum by backing issues that he knows will win congressional support immigration reform is too volatile he needs a win and its not quite clear that immigration is a sure winner crayton said its more likely that obama will concentrate on immigration changes that can be enacted without congress crayton said mark krikorian predicted the new president will reduce the number of deportations and workplace raids as a way to appease people pushing for immigration reform he may push the voluntary everify online systems designed to help employers check on a workers immigration status its too politically dangerous for the president to push for comprehensive reform that includes a path to residency for illegal residents said krikorian leader of a center for immigration studies think tank that advocates more enforcement against illegal immigrants but he does think obama may support smaller bills like the dream act which offers legal status to young adults who were brought to the us illegally as children hes going to throw some bones to the proamnesty crowd krikorian said some of the people walking to their cars outside an oxnard walmart arent looking for bones they want amnesty for illegal immigrants i see more us citizens who are here for welfare and there are these hardworking people who are getting sent back said amber arroyo who is 26 and cleans houses for a living others think obamas priority list should have one item the economy of course said a filipino woman who offered this solution improve it do something jose hernandez a 26yearold cook from oxnard is in the middle he thinks people living here illegally need to be able to come out of the shadows but he thinks the key to virtually all of the countrys problems is marked by dollar signs once we get the

resources to help gain operational control over the borders of the united states enforce and strengthen interior immigration laws and create additional penalties for immigration violations the bill contains some 72 separate provisions which represent the ideas and insights of numerous members of congress a variety of federal and state agencies affected by illegal immigration stakeholders and members of the public some of these provisions represent compromise positions adopted by senators in the last immigration bill and others contain tough new enforcement provisions the debate we had a few weeks ago on immigration reform should not deter congress from doing what is still needed to secure our borders and reduce illegal immigration said kyl we should take what we learned from that debate that the american people want enforcement and put it into workable legislation thats exactly what weve done here on the whole the legislation distills many of the lessons that we learned discussing immigration reform in the senate each of the provisions contained in this bill can stand alone on its own merit or be combined with any other immigration bill introduction of this bill is consistent with what the american people are asking us to do said sessions the bill requires that the department of homeland security complete construction of the full 700 miles of southern border fencing improve cooperation with state and local law enforcement and increase enforcement of immigration laws at the workplace these are important steps toward creating a lawful system of immigration the failure of the senate to pass comprehensive immigration was a huge disappointment said kyl although we must move forward with other issues we can show the american people that we are serious about securing our nations border this bill highlights the steps that need to be taken to ensure the integrity of our national security and immigration system and would provide an essential step toward achieving comprehensive reform in the future our legislation streamlines deportation proceedings provides robust border and visa controls and makes available to local and federal law enforcement more tools to aggressively deal with illegal immigration said graham our immigration system is structurally flawed there remain at least half a dozen major changes in policy our nation must address to get the problems of illegal immigration under control this is another step forward in that endeavor the bill would authorize significant increases in the number of personnel to patrol the border staff the ports of entry prevent smuggling and investigate immigration violations it would also increase the amount of fencing vehicle barriers physical infrastructure and technology to observe and deter illegal crossings and the amount of detention space to hold unlawful aliens the bill would also mandate that dhs detain unlawful aliens crossing the border until those aliens are removed it would require that dhs capture biometric data on all foreign nationals legally entering and departing the united states and identify track detain and remove those who overstay their visas the bill would authorize significant increases in personnel for dhs and the department of justice to enforce the immigration laws in the interior of the united states it would add new legal authorities to prevent the entry and enable the removal of suspected terrorists aggravated felons gang members human smugglers and other criminals the bill would add new legal authorities to deter and prosecute crimes against children to combat smuggling and to prevent fraud it would also enhance the ability of state and local law enforcement officers to identify unlawful aliens and increase funding to states adversely affected by illegal immigration the bill would enhance laws to prevent the hiring of unlawful aliens in the united states it would require dhs to establish an employment verification system that would make it easier to identify unauthorized workers in part through enhanced datasharing between federal and state agencies the bill would increase the security and integrity of social security cards and provide funding to assist states in issuing more secure drivers licenses and identity documents the bill would increase civil and criminal penalties against employers who knowingly hire unlawful aliens and persons who misuse identity documents highlights requires hiring of 14000 new border patrol agents to secure the borders mandates construction of 700 miles of fence 300 miles of

867 of 997 documents el paso times texas june 23 2007 saturday immigration judgeship appointments under scrutiny byline by louie gilot el paso times section news length 886 words guadalupe gonzalez is the chief counsel for immigration and customs enforcement in el paso a lawyer with more than 20 years of experience in immigration law and a stellar record in 2002 she made the next logical career move she applied to become an immigration judge i love el paso it is my homei was born and raised here and its important for me personally to contribute in a role that is both vitally important to our country and of particular importance to the el paso community she said but the job went to a white male candidate with no reported immigration experience in 2004 when two other judgeships opened they went to two other white males both of them gonzalezs subordinates with markedly less expertise in immigration law than gonzalez gonzalez 56 sued the attorney general for discrimination on the basis of gender and national origin and the suit is pending in a washington dc court in her filings gonzalez claimed that since 2001 only two hispanics were appointed nationwide for 40 immigration judgeships the four immigration judges in el paso are all white men the case has attracted national attention amid a scandal over the apparent politicization of attorney general positions and judgeships last year the department of justice fired eight us attorneys prompting congressional hearings this month an analysis by the washington post found that at least onethird of the immigration judges appointed since 2004 have had republican connections or have been administration insiders and half lacked experience in immigration law bill day gonzalezs lawyer in washington dc said that while his client does not allege that the departments selection of judges in her case was politically motivated there is a common thread between the cases the attitude of the department of justice was that the rules did not apply to them day said department of justice officials said they could not comment on the pending gonzalez lawsuit but defended their hiring practices immigration judges appointed during this administration were well qualified for their current positions said department spokesman dean boyd in washington dc the department does not exclude from consideration those without immigration experience but does consider immigration law experience as a factor in hiring immigration judges the department of justice changed its hiring process for immigration judges in april vacancy announcements are now posted online and applications are reviewed by a panel it also now requires that newly appointed immigration judges pass an exam on immigration law department officials said the changes were motivated by reports of immigration judges failing to display temperament and produce work that meets the departments standards an official statement read the more than 200 immigration judges in the united states decide the fate of more than 300000 immigrants each year including whom to deport and whom to grant asylum to the judges rule alone and appeal rights are limited immigration experts said that immigration law is a complicated matter with the intricacy level of tax law the political leanings of an applicant for an immigration judge position really should be irrelevant said kathleen walker of el paso presidentelect of the american immigration lawyers association there should be a focus on hiring those with immigration law expertise for these positions whether from government service or from the private sector in gonzalezs case the department bypassed the competitive hiring process by using the attorney generals direct appointment authority in 2002 gonzalez did apply for a posted immigration judge position which went to richard ozmun a retired us navy lawyer but in 2004 two other vacancies were never posted and gonzalez was not contacted for an interview even though she had previously expressed interest in becoming an immigration judge these positions went to robert hough assistant chief counsel at ice under the direct supervision of gonzalez and thomas roepke a special assistant us attorney for ice the government tried to have gonzalezs case dismissed on the ground that since gonzalez did not actually apply for the positions she did not know were open it was not possible for her to have been discriminated against in the selection process but a washington dc judge denied the motion last year saying that the agency could no more discriminate in their direct appointments than in more competitive settings gonzalez judge emmet g sullivan wrote had identified a particular policy that has a discriminatory effect on a particular group the attorney generals direct appointment authority the suit asks for gonzalez to get an immigration judge position back pay and compensatory damages an immigration judge in el paso makes between 112633 and 148031 a year gonzalezs lawyer said in light of all the wrongdoing this case has uncovered the department of justice should have settled this case a long time ago now it looks as though theyll have to pay the price at trial day said being mexican american should not disqualify a talented and experienced lawyer from being an immigration judge louie gilot may be reached at

federal law lets city police be trained byline steve mocarsky wilkesbarre pa times leader section state and regional news length 881 words jul 24hazleton mayor lou barletta plans to have city police certified as immigration enforcement agents despite claims from opponents to his illegal immigration relief act that immigration enforcement is strictly a federal task barletta said he learned about a 1996 amendment to the immigration and nationality act and an immigration enforcement training and certification program offered by the bureau during a trip to washington dc in december the 1996 amendment allows state county and municipal law enforcement and corrections officers to enforce immigration law under certain circumstances on that trip barletta members of his administration and city police officers met with federal law enforcement and immigration officials to discuss strategies for handling hazletons crime problems my first and foremost wish was that the immigration enforcement bureau would locate an office here in hazleton however this is another option that i believe would benefit hazleton i would like to enter into a memorandum of understanding and well pursue the possibility barletta said giving city police officers the ability to process illegal immigrants would be an advantage barletta said given the unlikelihood that the bureau will locate a field office in the city talking with the police chief there are some cities that dont want to get involved in taking the time required in processing those involved in illegal immigration however in hazleton we believe it would speed up the process of having our officers trained and certified to handle the immigration violations under certain circumstances that are allowed barletta said in addition to a memorandum of understanding there are some fairly rigorous requirements for participation said mike gilhooley spokesman for the department of homeland securitys bureau of immigration and customs enforcement he said any police or corrections officers who participate in the program would have to undergo three to five weeks of instruction on immigration law civil rights law and antiprofiling information basically the training is designed to give officers an outstanding understanding of immigration law and protect the civil rights of the people in their custody he said gilhooley said agencies in four counties and three states have memorandums of understanding with his bureau and 158 law enforcement or corrections officers have been certified as immigration enforcement agents the state entities include the florida department of law enforcement the alabama department of public safety and the arizona department of corrections counties with entities include sheriffs departments in los angeles san bernardino and riverside counties in california and mecklenburg county in north carolina gilhooley said the federal government pays the instructors the state county or municipal agency involved pays its employees and provides the facility for the training civil rights attorneys have threatened to sue the city if council passed barlettas relief act ordinance which fines landlords who rent to illegal immigrants punishes businesses that employ them and disallows official communication in languages other than english city council passed the illegal immigration relief act on july 13 and is expected to pass in august a landlordtenant ordinance that would require tenants to obtain occupancy permits to get an occupancy permit they would have to prove residency status or citizenship the attorneys said that the ordinances violate immigration and fair housing laws but the times leader also learned last week that federal immigration attorneys dont believe hazleton code enforcement officers would be violating immigration law by asking for documents that show proof of legal residency or citizenship when issuing occupancy permits our legal department could find nothing in immigration law that would preclude a government agency from requesting such documents if doing so would accomplish something useful within its lawful authority said chris bentley spokesman for the us department of homeland securitys bureau of citizenship and immigration services bentley posed the question to them after a reporter asked if city officials were allowed to require people to show documents that would prove their right to legally reside in the united states or if that power was limited to immigration officials and employers bentley stressed that the bureaus attorneys were not offering a legal opinion and we would never render one in a case like this because its out of their legal purview in the daytoday operations of the bureau but bentley said council requiring code officers to request documents to prove residency status or citizenship for the dispensation of occupancy permits would seem to fit within their lawful authority based on our understanding of

880 of 997 documents inland valley daily bulletin ontario california may 19 2005 thursday border police initiative might face legal roadblocks byline by brenda gazzar length 863 words assemblyman ray haynes proposal to create a state immigration police force to help patrol the border and enforce immigration laws statewide could meet resistance from the federal government and be disputed in the courts beyond borders a special report on immigration haynes initiative petition proposal announced earlier this month would create a new agency with hired officers and trained volunteers who would strictly enforce immigration laws if it makes the statewide ballot and is approved by voters haynes rtemecula cites a 1996 provision of a law that allows state and local agencies to negotiate agreements with the federal government to enforce immigration laws but federal officials say the law has never been applied to create officers strictly devoted to immigration and they have no intention of doing so we would not create a memorandum of understanding that created fulltime immigration officers because we have fulltime immigration officers said manny van pelt a spokesman for immigration and customs enforcement which negotiates such agreements on behalf of the us attorney generals office the way it was meant to be used is as a tool to help officers in the street or in the jails to help them do their daytoday jobs in addition to their normal routine haynes says he interprets the law 287g of the immigration and naturalization act to mean states can step in and enforce immigration laws after technicalities are worked out with the government im sure we can influence ice to sit down and talk with us or we can influence them through the legislative process haynes said one way or another we will get it done immigration and customs enforcement created in 2003 as part of the department of homeland security investigates and enforces suspected customs and immigration violations in the country and carries out judicial rulings on immigration cases haynes wants the state agency that would be created by his proposal to use any means available to enforce the law including worksite enforcement memos negotiated so far with a couple of agencies in the nation have prohibited law enforcement officers from conducting immigration raids on businesses or doing worksite enforcement van pelt said meanwhile experts disagree as to whether a plan for a separate state immigration police force would be constitutional or allowed state and local agencies have the inherent authority to enforce federal law unless congress specifically prevents them from doing so said mark krikorian executive director of the washington dcbased center for immigration studies congress can and has preempted the states from enforcing other areas of law but immigration isnt one of them krikorian said immigration attorney carrye washington of ontario disagreed its the federal government that is properly trained to know the immigration laws and any time state police groups decide they should regulate or do something to an immigrant it seems they are doing something that is not constitutional she said whether states and localities have inherent authority to enforce civil immigration laws is an open question said marshall fitz associate director of advocacy for the american immigration lawyers association the understanding prior to 2002 was that they do not he said in 2002 however the department of justice issued a memo reversing that interpretation but has never made that document public if it did become an issue that was litigated the federal government in all likelihood would not side with the individuals challenging the policy fitz said they would probably weigh in on the side of the state of california but thats not totally clear though because of its scope haynes proposal could be challenged by the federal government if approved by voters he added since sept 11 2001 the federal government has been trying to enlist the states to enforce federal immigration laws said charles doskow professor of law at the university of la verne college of law in ontario i have no question that it would be sustained that federal law enforcement would welcome it because they are trying to identify possible terrorists doskow said they regard illegal aliens as one of those sources haynes measure once titled and summarized by the state attorney general would have to gain nearly 600000 valid signatures to be put on the june 2006 ballot the california border police initiative is being backed by rescue california which gathered more than 14 million signatures to recall former gov gray davis in 2003 according to haynes office for more

these wouldbe americans the system was unforgiving a woman who says she fled the democratic republic of congo to escape torture now faces deportation back to that country a working mother is back in india after a flat tire led police to alert immigration officials a young ethiopian woman is deported to her native country after her appeal for asylum languished for nearly a decade in the federal bureaucracy and her marriage to a us resident wasnt vetted by immigration officials fast enough ever since the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 the nations immigration system has stepped up its scrutiny of immigrants and its enforcement of deportation laws some who get deported have committed heinous crimes and elicit little sympathy from the public but others such as the women mentioned above have received public outpourings of concern and support is there logic behind who gets kicked out experts say yes theoretically there is but it is coupled with less willingness by immigration officials to exercise discretion out of fear theyll let in or let go the next terrorist add to that the legendary inefficiency of the immigration system then include a growing number of leads and tips about potential immigration violators all in all the system is catching a lot of people including many who pose little if any security risk the 2001 attacks led to a reorganization of how the federal government dealt with immigration the immigration and naturalization service was replaced with multiple agencies under the department of homeland security the primary agency charged with handling deportations is us immigration and customs enforcement spokesmen for the agency insist it does not pursue people randomly but rather targets first the bad guys suspected terrorists convicted criminals especially sex predators and smugglers the agency also targets absconders people who are under a court order to leave the country but havent many such absconders entered the country legally through visas and other means from a priority basis yes we are prioritizing our goals our missions much more to rid this country of the most dangerous people said carl rusnok an immigration and customs spokesman what makes the system less predictable are the many leads through law enforcement agencies or civilians that agents receive about the illegal immigrants who otherwise may not have been targets immigration officials said the agents simply follow up the tighter enforcement shows in the numbers from october 2003 through september 2004 immigration and customs removed a record number of criminal and other illegal immigrants from the united states the total was 161346 removed including 85165 who were considered criminals but the numbers mask many complex often sympathetic cases immigration law is different from criminal law and often what counts as a misdemeanor in the us criminal justice system may count as a deportable aggravated felony for purposes of immigration consensual sex with a minor often is prosecuted as a misdemeanor under the criminal system but it could lead to deportation under immigration the 1996 reforms to immigration laws also made retroactive some of its provisions so permanent residents who had already been convicted of certain crimes years before still face deportation its real slippery said erich straub a milwaukee immigration attorney theres a lot of people put into these categories that if the general public knew what they had really done they wouldnt feel like deportation was necessarily the just result many who favor stricter immigration laws say the government is not being tough enough especially when it comes to finding people who entered the country illegally and remain undocumented its a reasonable list of priorities except for the fact that it completely ignores illegal alien workers said jack martin of the federation for american immigration reform when the interior enforcement people have tried to crack down on illegal alien workers they have systematically run into political repercussions from politicians representing businesses critics of the immigration and customs agency meanwhile say the nations immigration databases are outdated backlogged and riddled with errors immigrants who send in change of address forms may never know they received orders to appear in court because immigration officials hadnt updated their system and sent the orders to the persons former address the sheer complexity of immigration law coupled with the fact that the people it affects most are foreigners who often face language barriers doesnt help neither does the length of time it takes for the system to work cases can last years abesha bobbie zenebes appeal for asylum lingered for almost a decade in the immigration system by the time it was denied she had married an american and was trying to obtain legal residency through him but immigration authorities didnt review her marriage to the okauchee wis contractor fast enough after months in detention and 15 years in the united states zenebe was sent back to ethiopia in late 2003 as far as the system goes there is no sense that theyre more efficient now said christina deconcini director of policy at the national immigration forum an immigrant rights group it continues to be a problem a recent case is that of regina bakala whose family said she came to the united states in 1995 using false papers to flee the torture in the democratic republic of congo judges ruled against her request for asylum but bakala didnt know this because her lawyer had moved and never learned of the verdict the legal nightmare worsened when she learned about the result last year after she and her husband tried to get financing for a house federal agents appeared at bakalas milwaukee doorstep a few weeks ago and detained her her supporters are seeking legal relief but she faces deportation any day the volume of leads immigration officials receive appears to be growing largely due to government efforts in july 2003 the immigration and customs law enforcement support center set up a tip line to gather information on potential violators from oct 1 to march 30 the line received more than 41500 calls thats more than the 27671 received all of the previous year were often quite amazed at the incredible detail with which some people report tips said mike gilhooly a spokesman for the center one controversial move by the department of homeland security has been uploading certain categories of immigration status data into the fbis national crime information center database police officers across the country routinely check the database for information about people they encounter if they run across someone immigration and customs wants detained they take the person into custody thats how brown deer wis police who came upon terwinder singhs flat tire played a role in her deportation last year the department confirmed singh who was living in sussex wis had entered the country 12 years before using false papers to come for an arranged marriage she lost her legal appeals to stay but her husband says never received word of her final deportation order singh is now back in india along with her two children who were born and raised in the united states many police officials worry that taking on the role of immigration enforcement will damage community policing efforts and even encourage those fearing deportation including witnesses to leave the scenes of traffic accidents and crimes some civil rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against the practice of entering the immigration data into national crime information center saying it encourages racial profiling among other things but others say enlisting police to find immigration law violators is a sensible step increasing the manpower available to rid the country of lawbreakers civilians meanwhile have entered immigration enforcement in rather unusual ways perhaps the most publicized have been the socalled minutemen who have volunteered along the countrys southern border to ward off those who try to cross into the united states illegally also others can now turn to civilianrun web sites such as reportillegalscom which sometimes for a fee will take their tips about potential illegal immigrants and forward them to federal officials by many measures the longstanding debate over immigration policy appears to be growing more heated with some leading figures expecting major reforms in the coming five years whats unclear is exactly what those reforms will be in 2004 president bush rolled out a proposal that allows immigrants to stay in the united states as guest workers but expects the workers to eventually return to their home countries an estimated 8 million to 12 million illegal immigrants live in the united states bushs proposal faces criticism from multiple sides some worry it could lead to amnesty and others say it does not address the fact that many of the guest workers will want to stay permanently on the enforcement end us rep f james sensenbrenner jrs real id bill is generating a great deal of debate the wisconsin republicans bill makes it more difficult for illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses but it also deals with asylum deportation and border security matters the bills critics are especially upset about the asylum provision saying it makes it even harder for people fleeing persecution to prove that to immigration officials in the united states but sensenbrenner has defended the proposal saying it is a matter of security sensenbrenners provisions were included in the supplemental spending bill for iraq which was approved by the house last month and currently is in conference

886 of 997 documents the new york times november 1 1998 sunday late edition final the 1998 campaign immigrants once divisive immigration now a muted issue byline by mirta ojito section section 1 page 33 column 1 national desk length 1187 words it is the weekend before the elections and immigration the source of much national angst in years past has disappeared from the election debate although not from lawmakers political agendas in the past year or so while the nation has focused on the white house and wall street congress has quietly scaled back some provisions of several 1996 laws that were written to discourage immigration by cutting a range of benefits to legal residents and stepping up deportation efforts the moves capped by proimmigration provisions in this years budget bill signal lawmakers awareness of the growing voting power of immigrants a couple of years ago people were advocating to build a wall around the country said senator spencer abraham a michigan republican who introduced several proimmigration provisions in this years spending bill thats no longer the case before we had heard only one side of the immigration issue now we get to talk about some of the positive contributions immigrants have made the immigration measures in the budget bill that president clinton signed allowing almost 50000 haitian refugees to stay in the country for example and increasing the number of visas granted to foreign professionals would have been unthinkable four years ago when antiimmigration themes dominated political campaigns nationally or two years ago when congress passed what many consider the most antiimmigrant legislation in decades no one is suggesting that congress is dismantling those laws particularly the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 indeed now that the immigration and naturalization service is flush with money most of the harsher measures of that law are being enforced still there seems to be a growing consensus among lawmakers that too much control of immigration is not good for politicians who recognize that immigrants votes could be pivotal in some races for businesses and the economy because valued employees have had to return home and prospective hires have not been granted visas or even for the government itself since control is expensive and time consuming those assumptions coupled with good economic news have led some anti immigration members of congress to take a cautious approach to immigration issues or ignore them the republicans are taking a waitandsee attitude said representative luis gutierrez an illinois democrat who is proimmigration they dont want to offend one side or alienate the other among some lawmakers especially those who advocate a hard line against immigrants there is a sense that the laws of 1996 were so sweeping that very little more can be done or added to the debate the budget for the immigration and naturalization service much of it dedicated to enforcement now surpasses that of the fbi and the agency has more employees than either the department of state or labor the clinton administration took some major steps showing that it was serious in trying to control illegal immigration said t alexander aleinikoff a law professor at georgetown university and former general counsel and associate commissioner of the immigration service some people are saying weve dealt with the problem weve done what we can lets move on but the issue of illegal immigration is far from resolved mr aleinikoff said there are about five million such immigrants in the united states and no law that specifically addresses what to do with them instead lawmakers are sidestepping immigration in their campaigns and have been passing legislation that benefits immigrants and in some cases reverses aspects of previous laws congress has restored most of the welfare benefits it took away from legal immigrants in 1996 lawmakers also restored some of the protections that central american immigrants had lost therefore sparing them from deportation congress granted amnesty to 150000 nicaraguans 5000 cubans and 49700 haitians and allowed hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who hope to gain permanent visas to stay in the united states instead of having to go home to file their applications as the 1996 law dictated congress granted 171 million to the immigration agency to speed the naturalization process and for the first time in years it increased by 5000 the number of refugees allowed into the country every year the pendulum is definitely swinging our way said judith e golub director of advocacy for the american immigration lawyers association in washington advocates for immigrants as well as those who oppose immigration say the pendulum began to swing in favor of immigrants four years ago the reelection of californias governor pete wilson who won in part by making his antiimmigration platform part of the national debate was a signal to immigrants everywhere that unless they quickly became united states citizens they too would feel the impact of measures like proposition 187 the proposition is a california ballot initiative seeking to deny education health and other benefits to illegal immigrants many rushed to naturalize and thousands of new citizens were ready to vote in the 1996 races the results caught the republicans by surprise in california a newcomer to politics loretta sanchez a democrat unseated the republican incumbent representative robert k dornan pete wilson brought out the angry white male in california and used immigration as a hotbutton issue to get reelected said frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum that brought out the angry new citizen in record numbers to vote and punish the republican party shortly afterward republicans began to change their tune speaker newt gingrich set the tone by pledging that his party would reach out to hispanic people and members of other minorities he hired an aide to oversee this effort and his office began releasing information translated into spanish and now running hard against ms sanchez again mr dornan is calling himself a friend of hispanic immigrants in texas gov george wbush a republican popular with hispanic immigrants who is seeking reelection is spending more money to attract hispanic voters than any other politician ever his campaign advisers said advocates for immigrants point to senator abrahams appointment as the chairman of the senate subcommittee on immigration as a turning point he replaced senator alan simpson a republican from wyoming who retired two years ago with representative lamar smith a republican from texas mr simpson was the architect of some of the more restrictive of the 1996 antiimmigration laws mr simpson did not return phone calls mr smith chairman of the house immigration subcommittee said in a statement the passage of a haitian amnesty reflects yearend budget deal making and not any change of heart in congress there was little support in the house for amnesty because it will set a bad precedent and undermines longstanding immigration policy loaddate

891 of 997 documents the new york times january 21 1998 wednesday late edition final white house will reject advice to abolish immigration service officials say byline by eric schmitt section section a page 14 column 2 national desk length 903 words dateline washington jan 20 the white house is preparing to reject a federal advisory commissions recommendation to abolish the troubled immigration and naturalization service and assign its duties to other government agencies officials said today instead the clinton administration proposes reorganizing the agency to clarify its dual some say conflicting roles of battling illegal immigration and giving benefits to legal immigrants toward that end it has hired a major consulting firm boozallen hamilton to help work out the details of the redesign a white house official who participated in the review speaking on the condition of anonymity said right now were not ready to embrace the commissions proposal to disband the ins but many of its points are valid and reform is necessary white house officials insist that president clinton and his top aides have not made any final decisions and that mr clinton will outline his plan in the fiscal 1999 budget he proposes to congress early next month but other government and congressional officials say they have been notified that a white house review has decided in principle against splitting up the agency as the united states commission on immigration reform recommended in september even before the administrations plan was formally announced republicans on capitol hill who have been exploring the idea of disbanding the agency expressed skepticism that a reorganization plan would solve the problems the proposal to split the agency is an issue that needs to be vetted further said senator judd gregg the new hampshire republican who heads the senate appropriations subcommittee that controls the immigration services spending it is a major move and i dont subscribe to it carte blanche but it may be the best way to go but i dont think this requires another outside consultant to review the management structure at issue is the advisory panels conclusion that the immigration service suffers from such mission overload that it can no longer manage its many priorities effectively the panel recommended that the justice department the immigration services parent agency retain responsibility for controlling the border and removing illegal immigrants the state department which now deals with visas at american embassies overseas would handle immigration services and benefits like citizenship requests the labor department would assume a greater role in overseeing the hiring of foreign workers breaking up the immigration service is an idea that has bounced around washington for at least a decade but the proposal has gained greater currency lately as congress and many of the nations governors are growing increasingly exasperated with the immigration services inability to cope with soaring requests for citizenship to weed out criminal aliens living in the united states and to crack down on the steady stream of illegal immigrants entering the country republicans greeted the administrations plan for a reorganization and outside review with skepticism and said they would continue to consider more drastic changes senator spencer abraham the michigan republican who heads the senate immigration subcommittee said last august we should consider splitting the ins up into one law enforcement agency and one legal immigration agency to increase the efficiency of both a spokesman for mr abraham joe mcmonigle said today that the senator stood by his remarks and would hold hearings early this year on reorganizing the agency the house appropriations committee last summer directed attorney general janet reno to review the commissions report and along with other federal agencies develop a restructuring plan by april 1 that would allow the immigration service to perform its duties more efficiently in response the white houses domestic policy council interviewed a wide variety of officials in government congress and independent groups about the advisory panels conclusions for the most part there was support for reform but not for the commissions recommendation to disband the agency said the white house official who was involved in the review ms reno and doris m meissner the commissioner of immigration and naturalization vociferously opposed any proposal to abolish the agency and urged the white house to let them solve the agencys problems mrs meissner argued that the agency had recently achieved significant victories in tightening the nations asylum system and the border with mexico south of san diego and deserved a chance to clean its own house at the same time other agencies that would assume duties from the immigration service were cool to the idea the state department for example argued that it was already absorbing the arms control and disarmament agency and the united states information agency mrs meissner said white house officials notified her in late december that the immigration agency would remain intact the immigration service then hired boozallen to a twomonth contract for 374498 that requires the consultants to give their recommendations by march 1 by laying out a detailed

894 of 997 documents the ottawa citizen october 6 1997 monday final edition a conspiracy of silence on immigration byline dan gardner the ottawa citizen section news dan gardner argumentobservation pg a13 i have a document that should appall anyone who still believes vigorous debate is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy entitled canadians attitudes toward immigration it was commissioned for citizenship and immigration canada cic and received by the government this past june it is a remarkable summary of how the policy that will shape canadas future more profoundly than any other and the chatter of those who produce it bear little resemblance to the views desires and fears of the canadian public you are not likely however to get a copy with a friendly phone call to the minister of immigration i made that call and was turned down cold it took freedom of information legislation and a twomonth wait to see what the ministers office did not want seen almost every page exposes the gulf between immigration policymakers and the opinionmaking class on one side and canadian popular opinion on the other supporters and opponents of current immigration levels are about evenly split and many of those who support the levels do so only halfheartedly support is highest in regions where almost no immigrants settle and lowest where the vast majority of immigrants do canadians predominantly think immigration contributes to unemployment the facts roll on but the most striking aspects of the study are those it only inadvertently highlights first its clear that official immigration policies and polite public discussion are utterly detached from the views of large sections of the canadian public more ominously for the future cohesion of what is already one of the worlds most fragmented societies current mass immigration seems to be entrenching new mutually suspicious solitudes canada does not debate immigration aside from very occasional newspaper columns the odd caller to phonein shows or little flurries over relatively minor issues like sponsorship or czech gypsies the media devote more time and effort to commercial fishing or gambling in the political arena no canadian party has seriously questioned basic immigration policies since the 1960s and immigration has not played a major part in any modern election this silence is particularly odd given that in each of the other three countries that permit mass immigration australia the united states and new zealand there are vigorous debates about the level of immigration or even whether mass immigration should be abolished stranger still canadas per capita rate of immigration is far higher than any of these three we accepted about 220000 immigrants in 1996 or about one immigrant for every 136 current residents in the us the figure is one immigrant to every 388 residents in new zealand it is one for every 233 resident and one to 253 in australia one in eight canadians is an immigrant compared to one in 16 in the united states about onehalf of canadas current population growth is the result of immigration a figure that will steadily rise as our birth rate drops over the coming decades so that by 2030 immigration may be the sole source of population growth immigration affects literally every segment of canadian life and if policies dont change it will do so to an even greater extent in future it is a critical policy and according to the cic report canadians are deeply divided about it so where is the debate it has been smothered beneath a blanket of orthodoxy that bears no resemblance to the opinions of canadians the liberal government continues to promise to increase immigration to one per cent of total population or in other words to increase current yearly levels by 80000 to 300000 per year the one per cent figure was chosen incidentally not because it has any policy significance but because its a nice simple figure that sounds vaguely significant the liberals are being urged to follow through by the ndp and numerous immigrant lobby groups adding to the push in print are several major newspapers and many columnists including andrew cardozo of the pearsonshoyama institute not to be outdone canadas right is even more bullish on immigration than the left the fraser institute chided the liberals for failing to meet their promise in their first mandate globe and mail columnist terence corcoran argues that anyone in the world who wants to come to canada should be allowed in southam national affairs columnist andrew coyne agrees but theres a wrinkle in the midst of this smooth surface of agreement the cic report states unequivocally there is virtually no public support for any increase in immigration levels no matter the public is apparently irrelevant it is often claimed however that popular opposition to mass immigration now has a democratic voice in the reform party but reforms immigration policy so often mischaracterized as antiimmigration calls only for a modest reduction in total numbers to 1987 levels and a resumption of the policy of reducing immigration during recessions standard postwar policy until brian mulroney changed it in 1990 and reform has generally been precluded from arguing even this tepid case for fear of raising the dreaded racism label so the official opinionchurning world has one almost uniform message immigration is an undiluted good we can argue about nuances like business investment programs but the basic policy of mass immigration on a scale unique in the world is not open for debate this message hasnt been missed by the public the cic study found substantial evidence that survey respondents were reluctant to express opposition to current immigration levels if they thought it would make them look racist this occurred if they were asked about matters such as racism ethnic diversity and multiculturalism before the immigration questions or if the interviewer had a foreign accent these are private surveys conducted by anonymous telephone interviewers and yet many of the almost onehalf of canadians with concerns about immigration felt compelled to censor themselves this is an indictment of the antidemocratic stifling dogma surrounding immigration the cic study also seems to deflate the myth that opposition to mass immigration neatly rises and falls according to the fortunes of the economy in 199o the mulroney government dropped the longstanding policy that immigration numbers would be reduced during recessions instead the government raised the numbers to levels not seen over an extended period since before the first world war support for the policy dropped as canada suffered the worst recession since the depression but commentators simply assumed that with the return of better economic times public support would rapidly rise the cic study did find slow growth in support to the current unimpressive level but it also detected evidence that this growth has actually peaked despite the rapid job creation of the past six months and rocketing consumer confidence the old pat belief that opposition to immigration is purely a product of lean economic times is beginning to look threadbare another serious gap between popular opinion and government policy was exposed in the publics response to the question of whether new citizens ought to be able to speak french or english overwhelmingly canadians agreed immigrantcanadians were particularly strong on this point yet government policy of the past several decades has allowed the number of immigrants who come to canada unable to speak english or french to rise from five per cent in the early 1970s to 41 per cent in the early 1990s on the central question of economics the public is again at odds with the chattering classes when asked what effect immigration has on unemployment more than twice as many said it increased unemployment than said it had a positive effect this view is predominant in the words of the report unfortunately this question is phrased inappropriately since employment is only one factor in the economic picture there are many economic concerns one could have with mass immigration other than its effects on employment a substantial part of the american labour movement for example opposes immigration on the grounds that it pushes lowend wages down but because this question is flawed we dont really know the full significance of the public response to it some of the respondents may be expressing the old canard immigrants take jobs to that extent the public response is unfortunate because its wrong the research is clear that over the longerterm immigration does not cost canadian jobs but theres a new myth being floated by the political and opinionmaking elite immigrants create jobs part of the public response may well be a rejection of this falsehood to that extent the public has it right a 1991 study by the economic council of canada found immigrations economic effect to be marginal and that very rapid increases in immigration can temporarily boost unemployment studies by the organisation for economic cooperation and development and the economic council of australia have replicated that finding and it is rapidly being accepted among economists the report contains numerous ambiguities like the employment question not due to any mistakes by its author but because the original public opinion polls use terribly vague questions that cry out for more information of course polls are the political elites way of finding the publics pulse in a healthy democracy that pulse would be evident in an open vigorous debate as a democracy canadas political system not only assumes such a debate is ongoing it needs it to make the best decisions public debate is a crucible that tests ideas exposes falsehoods and makes strong ideas stronger yet the critical policy of mass immigration has escaped that crucible it may be good policy as half of canadians think or it may be seriously flawed as the other half feel but there is one certainty canadas failure to debate immigration is a failure of democracy itself in future ill look at some of the more unsettling revelations of the cic study including the remarkable regional variations that mark canadians views of the effects of immigration and further define canadas growing

898 of 997 documents the new york times august 5 1997 tuesday late edition final us study panel recommends plan to break up ins byline by eric schmitt section section a page 1 column 6 national desk length 1378 words dateline washington aug 4 in an effort to improve the nations immigration system a federal advisory panel has decided to recommend abolishing the troubled immigration and naturalization service and assigning its duties to other government agencies declaring that the immigration service suffers from mission overload the panel the united states commission on immigration reform is proposing that the justice department the immigration services parent agency retain responsibility for controlling the border and removing illegal immigrants the state department which now deals with visas at american embassies overseas would handle immigration services and benefits like citizenship requests the labor department which now monitors wage and hour laws would also enforce rules covering the hiring of foreign workers according to a draft copy of the report structuring organizing and managing an effective immigration system obtained by the new york times its very hard for one agency with so many conflicting missions and so much fragmentation to have priorities set and missions realized said bruce a morrison a commission member and a former democratic congressman from connecticut explaining the panels reasoning for dismantling the immigration service democrats and republicans in congress who have been briefed by the commission in the last few weeks generally embrace the proposal to separate along functional lines the disparate immigration duties but the immigration service and the justice department are gearing up to fight the proposal were against splitting up ins said carole florman a justice department spokeswoman we believe the enforcement functions and benefits functions really do work hand in hand the proposal comes at a time when congress and many of the nations governors are growing increasingly exasperated with the immigration services inability to cope with soaring requests for citizenship weed out criminal aliens living in the united states and crack down on the steady stream of illegal immigrants entering the country the message to the administration is that this is not about rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship its about getting results said allen kay a spokesman for representative lamar smith the texas republican who heads the house immigration subcommittee and has been briefed on the proposal the house appropriations committee last month directed attorney general janet reno to review the commissions report and along with other federal agencies develop a restructuring plan to perform the nations immigration duties more efficiently house members led by representative harold rogers the kentucky republican who heads the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the justice department are urging the administration to act on the proposal by october 1998 the commissions report is to be released by late september the scope of the panels recommendations has surprised many senior administration officials policymakers who have been briefed on the commissions findings including patrick f kennedy the acting under secretary of state for management declined today to comment on the conclusions privately though administration officials said the report would be a starting point for a spirited debate on how to manage the countrys burgeoning immigration system many of the nations governors also find the commissions proposals intriguing the ins has done an abominable job in so many areas including patrolling the border that we are certainly open to looking at other options said sean walsh deputy chief of staff to gov pete wilson of california a republican officials at the immigration service one of the fastestgrowing agencies in the government whose budget has doubled to 31 billion this fiscal year from four years ago said the commissions proposal would reverse this financial investment and ignore improvements the agency had made in recent years in response to congressional criticism wed be redoing all the work weve done in the past said chris sale the immigration services deputy commissioner independent immigration experts who criticize the immigrations dual role as border cop and benefit provider today gave mixed reviews to the commissions proposals many said they needed to see more details theres ample reason to doubt that the ins can be a service provider and an enforcer for the same group of people cecilia munoz deputy vice president of the national council of la raza a civil rights group in washington however its not clear that separating the functions is going to fix the fact that the service side of the ins has traditionally gotten short shrift demetrios g papademetriou a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace was more critical the commissions intent is to generate a conversation rather than to actually put out a blueprint this proposal would send an orphan agency from one department to another in washington terms this should be dead on arrival mr papademetriou said he favored combining all the nations immigration duties into one new agency similar to how the government consolidated the tasks of 11 agencies to form the environmental protection agency in 1970 that would give an agency the authority to be held directly accountable and to have the opportunity to propose and fight for its own proposals mr papademetriou the commission considered creating an independent immigration agency mr morrison said but ultimately rejected that idea as less effective than assigning inss duties to other agencies congress created the bipartisan commission in 1990 to help advise lawmakers on immigration issues eight commissioners evenly divided among republicans and democrats are appointed by congress and the president appoints the chairman the panel had its greatest influence when the late barbara jordan the former congresswoman from texas was the chairwoman during her tenure the panel issued reports on legal and illegal immigration earlier this year after her death the panel released a third report which criticized provisions of an immigration law passed last year that authorizes the immediate expulsion of some wouldbe refugees who arrive in the united states but the commissions fourth and final report is likely to be its most politically explosive after interviewing current and former immigration officials from several government agencies the panel concluded some of the agencies that implement the immigration laws the ins in particular have so many priorities that they have proved unable to manage all of them effectively the report continues such a system is set up for failure and with such failure further loss of public confidence in the immigration system to solve this problem the panel recommended thinking of the immigration system as having four main components border and interior enforcement benefits and visas workplace labor standards and an appeals process for enforcement actions the enforcement functions including removing illegal immigrations and breaking up smuggling rings would be handled by a new division or bureau in the justice department these functions already receive priority at ins but identifying them as the sole mission of a single agency would avoid some of the conflicting priorities the draft report said the state department would assume all responsibilities for immigrants benefits if all the responsibilities were consolidated the draft report said there would be a seamless process beginning with nonimmigrant and immigrant processing through naturalization to passport issuance and overseas citizenship services the labor department would have new duties for enforcing sanctions against employers who fail to verify workauthorization requirements the draft report said the head of the panel is shirley m hufstedler in addition to mr morrison the other seven commissioners are lawrence h fuchs michael s teitelbaum

canadianborn residents say two recent studies which like magnets attracted controversy but maybe not for all the right reasons the university of toronto and simon fraser university surveys suggest as commentators have said that employers might discriminate against new immigrants because their skin is not white but the surveys also reinforce anxiety that canada has welcomed too many immigrants their findings back up arguments that canada has excessive numbers pursuing too few jobs and driving down wages especially of those with low skills the federal government may be guilty of both feeding immigrants falsely high expectations and shortchanging nativeborn canadians immigration issues divide people and prove ethically complex while compassionate liberals lean toward openborder policies to give a chance to struggling people in struggling countries the 20thcentury philosopher john rawls says a nation cant be expected to improve the lot of everyone in the world nations can maintain a just welfare society only with tight borders canada is one of just six countries in the world including the us britain australia new zealand and israel that officially welcomes immigrants says university of toronto demographer david foot coauthor of the bestselling book boom bust and echo and canadas immigration levels he says are the highest per capita in the world north american economists who have so far won governments ear support high immigration they claim immigrants improve a countrys overall economy but other economists say what is more painfully clear is immigration creates economic winners and losers in novembers atlantic monthly george borjas professor of public policy at harvards john f kennedy school of government wrote that affluent americans tend to gain from high immigration while poor americans generally suffer the debate over immigration policy is not over whether the entire country is made better off by immigration it is over how the economic pie is sliced up borjas says current immigration redistributes wealth from unskilled workers whose wages are lowered by immigrants to skilled workers and owners of companies that buy immigrants services in canada says simon fraser university immigration specialist don devoretz studies show that workers in 47 major canadian industries are losing jobs or getting lower wages because of immigration borjas says immigration policy is a tugofwar between those who gain from immigration and those who lose so far borjas maintains the winners particularly employers who gain lowerwage workers and more consumers have been indifferent to the problems of the losers borjass analysis helps explain why north american business leaders and governments seem so out of sync with the public on immigration a recent mcintyre and mustel poll reveals 60 per cent of british columbians think immigration levels are too high their reasons are not necessarily racist women are becoming more likely than men to dislike high immigration for pragmatic reasons pollsters say greater vancouver women are more in touch with how high immigration is making it harder for their offspring to get strong educations entrylevel jobs and affordable housing in boom bust and echo foot says the last thing canada should have done during the recession that struck most of canada in the early 1990s was allow in record numbers of immigrants more than 210000 per year with canadas babyboomers already in the labor force depressing wages the country didnt need more immigrants to further push down salaries foot says even at half its current level of immigration foot says canadas birth rate is robust enough to keep the countrys population growing until the middle of the 21st century and anyway foot says theres nothing wrong with populations that arent vigorously swelling many european countries already have stable populations and europe remains prosperous foot says an absence of population growth results in increased productivity and reduced pressure on both urban and rural environments theres no doubt foot adds that continuing to allow in high numbers of immigrants who tend to be young will hurt the children of the baby boomers the echo boom as the echo generation enters the labor market in the first decade of the next century canada will need to consider curtailing immigration foot says it does not make sense to bring in a flood of 20yearold immigrants to compete for scarce jobs when larger numbers of canadianborn 20yearolds are also entering the labor market doing so would be unfair both to immigrants and to resident canadians solutions canada needs an immigration policy that balances humanitarian concerns for those outside the country with the needs of a variety of resident canadians its an ethically difficult task worthy of more public debate from more sectors including labor which has remained silent although it sounds harsh foot and borjas make a strong case that federal immigration policies should not be so strongly based as they are now on reuniting families as rawls suggests one country cant save the world or even an entire extended family however many votes it might get politicians beyond refugees most potential immigrants should be carefully targeted most importantly borjas and foot make it emphatically clear that immigration policies should be linked to the business and demographic cycles of the receiving country and even provinces such as bc that means cutting back on immigration when the economy is weak and unemployment is high such policies would

902 of 997 documents the new york times january 17 1997 friday late edition final effort to reduce legal immigration loses impetus in congress byline by eric schmitt section section a page 17 column 1 national desk length 1151 words dateline washington jan 16 soon after president clinton enacted broad new restrictions in september against illegal immigration many conservative lawmakers vowed to make reductions in legal immigration a chief goal in 1997 but four months later senior house and senate members say that effort has stalled and congress will probably not reduce the number of foreigners immigrating here legally a figure that approaches one million a year anytime soon i really dont see much prospects of more action in that area at least not this year senator trent lott of mississippi the majority leader told the united states chamber of commerce last week representative lamar smith the texas republican who wrote the illegal immigration bill in the house last year and tried unsuccessfully to include a 30 percent reduction in legal immigration after five years said in an interview unlike last year im not planning to introduce a major bill any time soon three factors caused the turnabout republican and democratic strategists said first declining republican support among hispanic and asianamerican voters in november has caused many republicans to voice fears that their party is becoming viewed as antiimmigrant second one of the senates main advocates of reducing legal immigration alan k simpson republican of wyoming retired he was replaced last friday as head of the senate immigration panel by a staunch supporter of legal immigration spencer abraham republican of michigan mr abraham outlined his priorities on tuesday in a speech at the cypress semiconductor corporation in san jose calif which like many other silicon valley companies relies heavily on foreignborn engineers legal immigration has been a positive thing and something we must continue to defend mr abraham a grandson of lebanese immigrants said those who wish to see wholesale reductions are headed in the wrong course mr abraham also said it made little sense to have a single agency the immigration and naturalization service responsible for keeping out illegal immigrants and at the same time letting in legal immigrants and refugees he suggesting splitting the ins into two agencies and shifting many of its borderenforcement duties to the customs service the final factor is that the enactment of the immigration bill and the welfare bill which sharply restricts federal benefits to legal immigrants seems to have spent at least for the present the public anger against immigrants and allowed lawmakers and policy makers to focus on carrying out the complicated new laws its pretty clear senator jon kyl republican of arizona said in a telephone interview that the big legislative issue was accomplished last year and that the primary work this year will be oversight even as supporters of deeper cutbacks in legal immigration retrench on the legislative front they are preparing a series of hearings to insure that the clinton administration carries out the new immigration law as congress intended were dealing with sweeping new legislation the immigration and naturalization commissioner doris m meissner told reporters on tuesday as she announced details of her agencys 31 billion budget for the 1997 fiscal year up from 15 billion in 1993 the budget this year finances 1000 new border patrol agents mrs meissner said including 251 in texas 237 in california and 166 in arizona mr clinton has promised to work with congress to repeal some of the restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants but mr lott and other republicans have signaled no willingness to broker any changes in the welfare law potentially more troublesome for the white house is congresss intent to investigate the administrations handling of several immigration issues republicans have contended that in the administrations rush to naturalize as many immigrants as possible before election day 1996 the ins allowed convicted criminals to become citizens representative robert k dornan the california republican who narrowly lost to loretta sanchez a democrat is asserting that some of those illegal voters cost him reelection the orange county district attorney is investigating the matter republicans are also looking into accusations that the immigration service falsified figures to make its enforcement operation along the californiamexico border look more effective than it is in addition they want to see what punishment the justice department gives to 13 officials who the departments inspector general concluded deceived a congressional delegation that visited the agencys operations in miami the ins has a history of being mismanaged said mr smith who as head of the house immigration panel will most likely be the administrations chief inquisitor this year mr smith added that he would hold hearings on changes in legal immigration but perhaps not until next year and with the purpose of reaching a consensus that may be difficult unlike restricting illegal immigration which had bipartisan support the campaign to cut legal immigration faced stiff resistance from an unusual alliance of hightechnology companies grassroots immigration groups and civilliberties organizations republicans and democrats were on both sides of the issue but republicans were more deeply divided critics like mr smith and mr kyl say the current system imposes unfair burdens on local governments and depresses wages in some fields supporters of the current immigration levels like mr abraham argue that immigrants do not sponge off society but work hard and spur job growth congress last year split the immigration bill in two parts one dealing with legal immigrants and the other with illegal immigrants a practical effect was to doom the changes in legal immigration which could not survive politically on their own advocates of lower legal immigration vowed to fight on this year but their difficult struggle was made even harder when mr abraham was named last week to head the senate immigration panel weve made no secret of our displeasure with abraham said dan stein executive director of the federation for american immigration reform which supports lower levels of legal immigration hes basically for sale to these hightech companies that want to import cheap programmers and engineers rosemary jenks director of policy analysis for the center for immigration studies a washington research group that supports lower levels of legal immigration said in an interview certainly we would have preferred that jon kyl had taken the position he

908 of 997 documents the new york times april 19 1996 friday late edition final provision in terrorism bill cuts rights of illegal aliens byline by eric schmitt section section b  page 9  column 1  national desk length 798 words dateline washington april 18 a littlenoticed provision in the counterterrorism bill approved by congress would drastically reduce the rights and protections of aliens with claims to remain in the united states civil rights advocates said today under the bill people who say they are fleeing persecution and who arrive in the united states without valid travel documents would have their asylum claims decided by a single immigration and naturalization service border officer current law requires a hearing before an immigration judge in 1995 3287 asylumseekers arrived without valid documents immigration experts said in addition the provision says anyone who has illegally entered the united states in the past may be summarily deported without judicial review currently these immigrants are entitled to a deportation hearing which guarantees constitutional rights like legal representation and places the burden of proof on the government to show why the alien should not be allowed to stay in the country this change could theoretically affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants including those who had lived here for years married american citizens or had children who are citizens last year alone about 80 percent of the 110000 cases that immigration judges decided involved people who faced deportation for being in the country illegally under the bill the fate of these aliens would rest with an immigration officer the bills provisions are a radical restructuring of the immigration laws that have nothing to do with terrorism and go far beyond anything in the immigration bills now being considered by congress said lucas guttentag director of the immigrants rights project at the american civil liberties union the house today approved the bill by a vote of 293 to 133 joining the senate which passed the legislation on wednesday by a vote of 91 to 8 president clinton has promised to sign the legislation in time for the anniversary on friday of the bombing of the federal building in oklahoma city with this version were facing really major changes in the way we and the immigration courts do business said david a martin the general counsel for the immigration and naturalization service the immigration service and civil rights groups were caught off guard this week by the immigration provisions included in the antiterrorism bill and were trying to assess its consequences mr martin said the administration would try to amend the immigration bill now before the senate to modify the provisions in the antiterrorism legislation both the immigration bill the house approved last month and the legislation before the senate include provisions similar to the terrorism bill regarding the exclusion of asylum seekers but neither bill goes as far as the counterterrorism bill to deny aliens already in the united states the right to hearings before an immigration judge senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont unsuccessfully tried to strike the immigration provisions from the counterterrorism bill on wednesday and is vowing to try again when the senate takes up its immigration bill in the next few days there are some circumstances and oppressive regimes in the world where if you are going to escape you may well need to rely on false papers mr leahy said on wednesday one congressional advocate for immigrants cited as an example inez l a 21yearold woman who fled el salvador in the late 1980s after her parents and uncle had been killed she entered the united states illegally with a cousin but was allowed to stay as a housekeeper in maryland under a program that granted temporary protection to refugees from el salvador and guatemala inez married and had twin girls but recently she and her husband separated and her work permit expires later this month under the counterterrorism bills provisions the ins could be required to separate inez from her children and send her back to el salvador without any hearing immigration experts familiar with her case said the potential is that all kinds of people who have a nebulous legal status would be deprived of existing immigration procedures as well as technical forms of relief said carol wolchok director of the american bar associations center for immigration law and representation in washington currently immigrants who have been in the united states illegally more than seven years can appeal to have their deportation suspended if they demonstrate strong family or employment ties why are we legislating against refugees in a terrorism bill asked

910 of 997 documents the new york times march 14 1996 thursday late edition final bill to limit immigration faces a setback in senate byline by eric schmitt section section b   page 12   column 5   national desk length 819 words dateline washington march 13 in a setback to those who want to cut legal immigration the senate judiciary committee appears ready to consider new restrictions on legal and illegal aliens in two separate bills with illegal immigration to be considered first rather than one overall measure if the committee approves this approach on thursday which its opponents conceded today was likely congress would probably have time in its compressed electionyear schedule to focus on illegal aliens and make few if any major changes in laws governing legal immigration passage of an amendment dividing the immigration bill into two parts this way would be a victory for an odd coalition of libertarians religious organizations proimmigration groups and business leaders who oppose restrictions on the entry of skilled foreign workers and the elimination of categories of relatives that american citizens can sponsor to live here supporters of legal immigration contend that the law now insures that american companies can remain competitive in the global market and helps to unify extended families in the tradition of this nation of immigrants senator alan k simpson a wyoming republican who is the main author of the legislation and who is seeking to reduce legal immigration acknowledged at a hearing today that he had exhausted all personal pleas and tactical ploys in an effort to delay the amendment he did not have the votes to defeat i can count the votes as well as anyone he said mr simpson and his allies who are seeking to cut legal immigration by about 20 percent from its current annual level of 775000 could always try to recombine the two bills or add amendments when the full senate considers the legislation in april but those approaches are filled with risks and uncertainty with congress operating on the tightened schedule proimmigration groups said splitting the immigration bill would probably force proponents of deep cuts in legal immigration to abandon their efforts or make enough concessions to win house and senate approval this would send a message that deep cuts in legal immigration are so controversial that unless they are tabled until next year or minimized considerably the whole immigration reform issue may falter said frank sharry executive director of the national immigration forum a proimmigration group in washington the house is to vote next week on its immigration bill which includes provisions on legal and illegal aliens but a big fight is brewing over whether to permit an amendment on the house floor to divide that bill in two at todays hearing in the senate the judiciary committee also approved by voice vote an amendment by senator edward m kennedy democrat of massachusetts to give judges broader discretion to impose stiffer criminal penalties on people convicted of illegally ferrying undocumented aliens into the country and in a victory for smallbusiness owners the committee approved an amendment by senator orrin g hatch republican of utah to eliminate provisions in the legislation to increase fines levied against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens the vote was 10 to 8 if the judiciary committee divides the bill it would represent a remarkable triumph for senator spencer abraham a michigan republican who has led the effort to divide it over mr simpson the senates leading voice on immigration issues and a skilled legislative tactician mr abraham a freshman senator whom mr simpson outflanked in the committees first meeting to consider the legislation regrouped and fended off mr simpsons efforts in recent days to peel votes from his side although mr simpson and his allies have said a vote to split the bill represents a vote to kill legal immigration reductions mr abraham says he has no such designs under mr abrahams amendment the committee would take up provisions dealing with legal immigration within seven days after finishing work on illegal aliens im in no way trying to kill legal immigration reform but its a distinct and separate topic and ought to be dealt with that way mr abraham said after the hearing but mr abraham added that addressing legal and illegal immigrants separately would pressure the committee to put together a legal immigration bill that enjoyed broad bipartisan support the clinton administration is a wild card in this legislative equation the white house last year endorsed a recommendation by a federal advisory panel to cut legal immigration by a third but recently the administration has focused its efforts more on curbing illegal immigration and guaranteeing protections for american workers the administration wants a bill that deals with legal and illegal immigration doris meissner the commissioner of

in review desk length 1131 words dateline washington every other week between april and midnovember an odd mixture of interest groups met in washington to plot strategy on how to defeat congressional proposals to overhaul the countrys immigration policy dubbed the leftright coalition on immigration by one of the participants it contained organizations that seldom see eye to eye on anything and indeed are often barely on speaking terms among those in the meetings the institute for justice a conservative civil rights group that strongly opposes affirmative action americans for tax reform an antitax antibig government group the home school network a christian fundamentalist group the american civil liberties union and the national council of la raza and the national immigration forum both of which oppose attempts to scale back legal immigration ive been in a meeting where an aclu guy the national immigration person and cato guy have all come in here to talk about strategy at the same time said an aide to senator spencer abraham a michigan republican ive never seen that before get used to it on the matter of the countrys immigration laws the issues are large the proposals complex and the bedfellows strange this issue puts patrick j buchanan the conservative commentator and republican presidential candidate and senator dianne feinstein the california democrat on one side favoring more limits while the other side claims representative robert k dornan the gaybashing california republican and representative barney frank the massachusetts democrat who is openly homosexual the prominent conservative republicans william bennett and jack kemp are strongly proimmigration while barbara jordan the famously liberal former democratic congresswomen from texas chaired a national commission that recommended cutting legal immigration by onethird a proposal that was endorsed by president clinton immigration is like that it is an issue so visceral and its impact so geographically uneven that it tends to blur traditional party and ideological lines the label liberal has usually embraced environmentalist causes for example but now some environmentalists have emerged as a major force behind the antiimmigration coalition among conservatives the immigration issue has highlighted the reemergence of old divisions between isolationists now resurgent with the fall of communism and freemarket internationalists its a mistake to think liberals are proimmigration and conservatives are antiimmigration said sanford j ungar dean of american universitys school of communication and author of fresh blood the new american immigrant simon and schuster thats a common mistake made in the current debate of course the debate summons concerns that are predictable even if they cut against traditional loyalties some of the liberal politicians who want immigration slowed for example are from states like california and florida where a surge of immigrants has led to a backlash that politicians ignore at their peril also some of the proposals being bandied about in congress are so sweeping that they contain some provisions that are bound to provoke someone for example christian fundamentalists assert that the proposal to end or restrict immigration preferences for parents and siblings of american citizens is antifamily the aclu and the national rifle association object from opposite political poles to a proposal by senator feinstein for a national identification card that contains a persons photograph and other identifying features like fingerprints the nra position is simple said grover norquist executive director of americans for tax reform who has been a leader in galvanizing conservative opposition to many of the proposals if youre going to register people why not guns some students of congress say the weird concoctions of allies in the immigration debate is an outgrowth of a trend in congress to produce more and more omnibus bills sweeping pieces of legislation that are an amalgam of nearly every proposal under the sun omnibus bills have been the preferred way to deal with other issues like crime and health care devised as a means to win support from different lawmakers by incorporating many pet proposals the omnibus bills can become a lightning rod for disparate interest groups seeking to deepsix them for those who want to know where the players tend to line up on immigration here is an ideological scorecard that might help free marketeers to them the debate over immigration is a reprise of recent legislative battles over the north american free trade agreement they believe that the free flow of people across national borders like that of goods and capital leads to prosperity major proponents house majority leader dick armey of texas the wall street journal editorial board nativists they believe that the current levels of immigration which since the immigration act of 1965 has been dominated by people from asia and latin america pose a threat to the anglosaxon part of americas culture some major proponents mr buchanan and the national review civil rights and ethnic advocates immigration is to them a human rights issue they view hostility to immigration as racist major proponents the national council of la raza the national immigration forum and various asianamerican organizations environmentalists and population control advocates many of these groups believe that the immigrationfueled increase in the united states population portends an overcrowded america unable to preserve its environment and its quality of life major proponents the federation for american immigration reform and the carrying capacity network which advocates population control job protectionists concerned about income stagnation among american workers and declines at the bottom of the scale they believe that immigration both legal and illegal depresses wages and takes jobs from unskilled americans major proponents some labor unions

with a national registry of social security numbers or alien registration documents before hiring major proponents the conservative cato institute the aclu antitax advocates and selected businesses

912 of 997 documents the new york times december 28 1995 thursday late edition final large increase in deportations occurred in 95 byline by steven a holmes section section a  page 1  column 5  national desk length 887 words dateline washington dec 27 responding to a rising tide of antiimmigration sentiment the clinton administration said today that the number of illegal aliens deported this year was a record 51600 up 15 percent from 1994 and up nearly 75 percent from 1990 most of the increase came from deportations of criminals who are illegal aliens nearly 62 percent of those deported this year were prison inmates who were expelled after serving their sentences up from 526 percent in 1991 and 4 percent in 1986 the immigration and naturalization service also announced a sharp increase in the number of people turned away at the nations borders for trying to enter illegally to 9400 from 5669 were putting a very heavy emphasis on making the system work properly said doris meissner commissioner of the immigration service in order for the system to work properly the final orders for deportation and exclusion have to count for something in the past they have not been effectively enforced the increase is occurring as congress is considering bills aimed at reducing both the number of legal and illegal immigrants and when immigration is expected to be an important issue in big states like california and florida that will be crucial to president clinton in the 1996 election contenders for the republican nomination especially patrick j buchanan the conservative commentator have made anger about immigration a central campaign theme at the white house the issue is being handled by rahm emanuel the former white house political director who now is president clintons assistant for strategic planning and communications this assignment indicates the political importance the administration places on immigration for illegal aliens who manage to evade the border patrol overstay their temporary visas and do not run afoul of the law once here the chances of being caught continue to be slight not counting the inmates more than 90 percent of the illegal immigrants who are sent back are halted at the border and some antiimmigration groups say with an estimated four million illegal aliens living in the country and with 200000 more settling here every year the removal of 51600 persons represents little more than opening a small sluice in a lake being fed by many streams as a result the groups say the increase in deportations is more symbolic than significant its nice that theyre making a priority of removing criminal aliens but the bottom line is most illegal aliens dont go home said dan stein executive director of the federation of american immigration reform a group that wants to cut both legal and illegal immigration the chances of being apprehended and deported once you get past the border patrol is less than 1 percent still officials of some pro and antiimmigration groups say the increase in removals is a significant change of focus for the ins this is a pretty big increase said jessica vaughan assistant director of the center for immigration study a research institute that argues that current levels of immigration have a harmful affect on minorities and the poor i remember a few years ago it was around 30000 a year the goal seems to be getting it up as high as possible so that the administration could be seen doing something about it and while some experts say the the emphasis on deportation is good policy virtually all say there is a political dimension to the administrations stepped up efforts there is an antiimmigrant wave thats sweeping the country right now which is being exploited politically by people in the republican and democratic parties said lucas guttentag director of national immigrants rights project of the american civil liberties union and the clinton administration wants to preempt immigration from being a political issue in the 1996 campaign experts in the area of immigration attribute much of the rise in deportations to the agencys decision to concentrate its resources on enforcement in addition while many federal agencies are coping with budget cuts the spending bill for the ins pending in congress would provide a 1287 million increase for the agencys enforcement divisions including an increase of 1400 people mainly detention and deportation officers but in recent years two other changes in law and policy have spurred deportations in july the ins and the justice department beefed up inspections of documents of people crossing the border south of san diego as a result 3029 illegal aliens were turned away and their names entered in a computerized identification system in 1994 the service expanded its program to hold deportation hearings for illegal aliens who were incarcerated for various crimes in state prisons the program was begun in 1988 but was expanded last year in the five states with the largest populations of illegal aliens california florida illinois new york and texas before the program aliens were sent to federal detention centers after serving their terms to await deportation hearings if there was no space available for them they were set free and were ordered to return voluntarily for their hearings now ms meissner said once the state sentence is over

918 of 997 documents the new york times june 5 1995 monday late edition final change of policy on us immigrants is urged by panel byline by robert pear section section a    page 1    column 6    national desk length 1637 words dateline washington june 4 a federal advisory commission will soon recommend gradually reducing legal immigration by onethird and reshuffling visa priorities to speed up the admission of spouses and young children of legal aliens members of the panel have said the proposals to be presented to congress later this month would make the biggest changes in more than 40 years in policies governing the selection of legal immigrants the panels plan would clear up a huge backlog of visa applications from the immediate relatives of permanent resident aliens but it would also eliminate longstanding visa preferences for siblings and adult children of united states citizens making immigration more difficult for them the ninemember advisory panel the commission on immigration reform headed by former representative barbara jordan of texas will emphasize the importance of the nuclear family as the basic unit of immigration members said under the panels recommendations the immediate relatives of united states citizens spouses children under the age of 21 and parents would still be allowed to immigrate without a waiting period or limits on the number admitted each year but panel members said they would recommend eliminating immigration preferences that have been granted for decades to other close relatives including the brothers sisters and adult children of united states citizens in general those relatives could not obtain visas to immigrate unless they qualified because of their job skills the commissions proposals are likely to be influential on capitol hill because congress created the commission appointed eight of the nine members and is seeking new ways to overcome deep disagreements on immigration policy since lawmakers have not yet seen the report there is no way to know how its recommendations will fare in congress but it is built on a complex set of tradeoffs intended to offer something to all sides in the immigration debate and it will no doubt further appeal to many in congress simply because the commission and its report offer some political cover on highly contentious issues many republican lawmakers favor new limits but some like dick armey of texas the house majority leader see immigration as an engine of economic growth and oppose new restrictions in addition the recommendations come at a time when many americans are expressing concern about immigration whether legal and illegal in california last november voters approved a ballot measure that would make illegal aliens ineligible for public education and most social services judges have delayed its enforcement while it faces legal challenges in addition the house of representatives in march approved a bill that would deny welfare food stamps and medicaid to legal aliens some members of the immigration panel said they were reluctant to discuss its recommendations because they were still editing the report but some suggested that public concern about illegal immigration was inevitably influencing public attitudes toward legal immigration one member of the panel bruce a morrison a former democratic member of congress from connecticut said current levels of legal immigration are not a problem but in the context of substantial illegal immigration there is a problem lawrence h fuchs a professor at brandeis university who is vice chairman of the commission said in the aggregate on balance immigrants have contributed to strengthening the united states he deplored what he described as a public fixation on numbers but added we have to have limits because of the disproportionate impact of immigration in some places like los angeles at a closed meeting from may 23 to 25 commission members said they affirmed the value of legal immigration but voted to recommend that congress reduce it by onethird over the next few years from its average over the last three years of 830000 a year in the transition period 700000 immigrants would be admitted annually after the transition 550000 would be admitted each year and that would become the normal level of legal immigration as a corollary panel members said congress should eliminate the large backlog of visa applications already filed on behalf of the spouses and minor children of permanent resident aliens congress could do that over three to eight years they said an immigration expert who worked with the commission said both sides of the equation are necessary reducing immigration without expediting the entry of immediate relatives flies in the face of human nature it will only increase illegal migration but expediting their entry requires the elimination of other categories in order to get the needed visa numbers susan martin executive director of the commission said there were 11 million wouldbe immigrants on the waiting list of spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents about 850000 are relatives of illegal aliens who gained legal status under an amnesty program created by congress in 1986 most others are overseas relatives of recent legal immigrants ms martin said it would take at least a decade to work through the backlog under current law commission members said it was not in the national interest for families to be apart for so long the panels major recommendations were approved by votes of 8 to 1 commission members said they were surprised that they had achieved a bipartisan consensus the dissenter was warren r leiden executive director of the american immigration lawyers association whose members represent legal and illegal aliens their relatives and employers this is a shortsighted proposal mr leiden said in an interview i would support revising the priorities for family immigration but cannot support the commissions proposal to eliminate three of the four existing family preference categories i also oppose the reduction of almost 30 percent in the ceiling for employmentbased immigrants the commission recommends that the government levy substantial fees on employers who want to bring in foreign workers like computer scientists engineers and health professionals the fees are meant to discourage employers from hiring foreign workers when americans are available employers willing to pay the fees could import foreign workers faster than they do now mr leiden criticized this proposal as a tax on american businesses that use foreign workers he said it would hinder access to the skills needed to compete in a global economy another panel member harold w ezell a former western regional commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service said i believe immigration is good for america but too much of a good thing can be harmful i love certain types of candy but if you eat too much youll overdose on chocolate weve got to have balance senator alan k simpson the wyoming republican who is chairman of the judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration has proposed a 25 percent reduction in legal immigration over the next five years to provide a breathing space the current flow of legal immigrants is more than can be comfortably absorbed he said in september the commission recommended a crackdown on illegal immigration along the border and at work sites it said the government should establish a computerized register of the names and social security numbers of all citizens and legal aliens authorized to work in the united states so employers could verify the immigration status of job applicants in february president clinton said he wanted to test such a system but many civil liberties advocate hispanic organizations and chinese and jewish groups have opposed such proposals saying they could increase job discrimination the argument that illegal immigration would undermine support for legal immigration upsets many immigration lawyers in essence legal immigrants are being made scapegoats for the inability of congress and the administration to control illegal immigration said stephen yaleloehr who teaches immigration law at cornell law school the proposed changes come just five years after congress authorized increases in immigration for certain groups including highly skilled workers the 1990 law more than doubled the number of immigrants who could be admitted because of job skills to 140000 a year from 54000 the jordan commission proposes reducing the number to 100000 on the ground that no more are needed commission members said they would also recommend eliminating the annual allotment of 10000 visas for unskilled workers seeking jobs in the united states the commission concluded that these immigrants compete directly with unskilled american workers and young people entering the labor force in addition panel members said that hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients would soon be looking for jobs if as expected congress imposes tough work requirements as part of a bill to overhaul the welfare system many unskilled immigrants work in restaurants and homecare jobs helping people who are elderly or disabled about 79000 unskilled workers are on the waiting list in this category the government is now issuing visas to people who have been waiting five years ms jordan the chairwoman of the commission is a professor at the university of texas in austin the other members of the panel

920 of 997 documents the toronto star may 20 1995 saturday final edition peculiar racial ideas mar immigration book alien nation common sense about americas immigration disaster by peter brimelow random house 306 pages 3350 byline by daniel stoffman section arts pg h16 length 1016 words in canada immigration is usually portrayed as a leftright issue with the left in favor and the right against in fact the political right is deeply split on this sensitive subject thats why rightwinger peter brimelow finds himself attacking his ideological soulmates as he dissects american immigration policy in his book alien nation open unselective immigration the prevailing policy in both canada and the us is a logical outgrowth of neoconservative ideology neoconservatives believe that market forces not governments should determine how many immigrants come to a country the true believer wants to remove as much power as possible from government including the power to control the nations borders he rejects the counterargument that uncontrolled immigration is damaging to the national or collective interest for him there is no such thing as the collective interest only individual interests the second reason the right typically favors wideopen immigration is practical rather than ideological increasing the supply of labor decreases its price brian mulroneys progressive conservative government representing bay street dumped the traditional canadian immigration program which was one of moderate fluctuating levels with an emphasis on skills in favor of a new program of permanent high immigration levels the populist right on the other hand includes in its constituency people who actually work for hourly wages and therefore disapprove of polices aimed at depressing them this explains why the reform party representing main street supports a return to normal immigration levels brimelow who used to live in canada where he wrote for macleans and the financial post and now writes for the business elites who read the wall street journal and forbes comes down on the side of the populists by urging a sharp cut in us immigration he takes issue with the journals ultraconservative editor robert bartley who wants totally open borders brimelow minces no words about who benefits from the sort of policies the journal advocates drawing on the work of the economist george borjas he demonstrates that current us immigration policy has only one significant economic impact to drive down the wages of us workers by 120 billion a year where does this vast sum go into the pockets of the capitalists of course the american elites support for immigration may not be idealistic at all concludes brimelow but selfinterested as a way to prey on their fellow americans alien nation is full of informative data like this much of it as relevant to canadians as to americans because on a per capita basis we have twice as much immigration as the americans do and our immigration program like theirs is now based chiefly on family relationships rather than skills unfortunately the book is marred by brimelows peculiar ideas on the subject of race until the immigration and nationality act amendments of 1965 the us favored whites over nonwhites in its immigration policy canada got rid of a similar policy about the same time but by choosing to accept immigrants mainly on the basis of family relationships both countries now in effect restrict immigration to residents of a handful of nonwhite countries because they are the only ones who have recentlyarrived relatives who wish to sponsor them this is unfair to prospective immigrants who dont have sponsors and gives the receiving country no control over who gets in but brimelow thinks the sponsorship system is bad mainly because it is tilting the racial balance of the us which was 90 per cent white 30 years ago and should in his opinion have stayed that way a british immigrant himself he seems to think the us is essentially a white british nation this is a profound misunderstanding of a country that has always been multicultural and whose major contribution to world civilization is jazz music a black invention brimelow nowhere suggests that nonwhites are inferior but he believes that different races cant get along and that countries with racially diverse populations will inevitably succumb to multiethnic mayhem his argument is unconvincing canada britain and australia are examples of countries where people of different races coexist peacefully moreover racial and cultural uniformity is no guarantee of social harmony somalia for example is one of the most homogeneous nations in the world and yet it destroyed itself in a civil war by his misguided emphasis on race brimelow gives those he calls immigration enthusiasts a chance to dismiss the rest of the book when they might learn something by reading it high immigration levels are neither necessary nor beneficial to the economy mass immigration hurts those at the bottom of the social ladder the skill levels of immigrants are in freefall massive nonwhite immigration coupled with affirmative action quotas make an explosive combination these are just a few of the points brimelow makes and they are just as applicable to canada as to the us his best argument is the what if question what if those who favor the current policy are wrong the result will be severe and longstanding economic social and environmental problems but what if those who favor less immigration are wrong the result would be a temporary labor shortage that could easily be fixed by opening the immigration tap a bit wider in other words the consequences of too little immigration are minimal while those of too much are grave there is no good reason to risk those consequences as brimelow points out high immigration levels are not an unstoppable natural phenomenon but rather the result of deliberate government policy and since that policy is both unnecessary and deeply unpopular brimelow is probably right in predicting that it will soon be changed daniel stoffman made a study of immigration policy as the 19911992 atkinson fellowship

921 of 997 documents the ottawa citizen january 7 1995 saturday final edition justice takes a backseat byline carolyn abraham the ottawa citizen section observer pg b1 javier loera who can neither hear nor speak was held by federal immigration authorities in maximum security at the regions detention centre for more than two months before his release friday his is a tale of a system that presumes guilt first and easily denies freedom loera crossed from the united states into saskatchewan by bicycle last year then sought out immigration officials in regina there he was detained for a deportation inquiry he was ordered deported even though he had no lawyer and no one knew his native country he was freed and told to stay in regina until his removal loera in his early 30s did not sign any documents agreeing to the conditions of his release its not clear if he even understood them because he got back on his bicycle he rode across the country and into ontario stopping at provincial police stations for a free meal and a night in the cell blocks when he reached ottawa in october he went to city police who unsure of his identity or origins contacted immigration canada since then loera has been in jail and has faced at least three detention review hearings without legal counsel on his first review a deaf inmate at the centre acted as his interpreter it wasnt until a qualified interpreter was eventually called that ottawa lawyer riad tallim heard about the case he met loera for the first time at ottawacarletons regional detention centre dec 5 he was devastated he was such a broken man he was slouched over shoulders concave you could see it on his face says tallim who said immigration officials had made no effort to get loera legal help after a threehour detention review dec 21 loeras first with a lawyer present ottawa immigration adjudicator gr mcbrien ordered him freed it had become clear that loera believed to be from chile had been trying all along to get home he had been peddling like mad to find the coast hoping to catch a boat for south america local immigration officials hadnt bought his story tallim is convinced that if he had not heard about the case which he handled free of charge loeras detention would have continued indefinitely in fact although loera was ordered freed dec 23 he remained in jail until jan 6 tallim was told immigration was shortstaffed over the christmas holidays and had no one to sign loera out were talking about someones freedom says tallim but immigration is an entity unto itself they have onerous powers and they can wield those with seemingly no responsibility if immigration canadas system of justice can disregard the rights of someone like loera it raises questions about the justice meted out to other immigrants those with criminal convictions in their past who have recently been subject to an unprecedented immigration crackdown critics say that by enforcing a section of the immigration act it had previously let lapse the federal government is trampling some fundamental civil rights under immigrations toughened policy many people face frequent lengthy incarcerations even if they have no current criminal charges or recent convictions they often face deportation hearings without legal representation and without family or friends present the immigration and refugee board has scheduled these hearings to be held in facilities which are closed to the public although the act says they must be open lawyers say its one thing to deport immigrants with past convictions some of whom have long records of serious crimes but quite another to sacrifice justice in the process some senior police officials who would be happy to see criminals forced to leave the country question whether the current process is fair and wonder if canada is being responsible by deporting people who may have spent most of their lives in this country and one diplomatic mission has criticized the immigration departments methods as bordering on human rights abuses the number of people being jailed has also risen sharply according to immigrations central detention and removals office in ontario 1223 people were being held in this province between april and november 1994 a 20percent increase over the same period the year before and these people are being locked up at immigrations request for periods of time that are averaging 50percent longer than they did in 1993 doug kellam assistant manager of detentions and removals says the increases reflect immigrations concentrated efforts to deport from the country noncitizens with criminal records since the toronto shootings of a police officer and of a young woman in the just desserts cafe last spring the federal immigration department has cracked down arresting detaining and deporting immigrants with criminal pasts both const todd baylis and georgina leimonis were shot by suspects who had been ordered deported but had not been removed in response citizenship and immigration minister sergio marchi established a joint immigrationrcmp task force in toronto montreal and vancouver to round up and remove 1888 people with criminal convictions who remained in canada despite being ordered deported but the crackdown has actually cast a wider net to include people who have past criminal records but no outstanding removal orders our objective here is to deport people says leonard jodoin director of national enforcement for immigration canada thats really what we do here a policy memorandum issued by immigration headquarters in ottawa this summer also directed staff to argue at immigration hearings to keep people detained rather than have them released on certain conditions as well local offices can now order deportation inquiries a decision traditionally made by regional supervisors police say this has led to a very very different response on the part of federal immigration authorities to the problem of immigrants who have committed crimes in the past we had our problems with people committing crimes says supt brian skinner head of ottawas criminal investigations they were people whose resident status in canada was at least questionable and for a long time our perception had been that this wasnt a situation immigration was taking very seriously that has changed and theres no disputing that many of those now facing deportation are hardcore cases theyve raped robbed moved guns and sold drugs among them are some of ottawas most notorious criminals locksley francis 29 who came to canada at age seven and has a lengthy criminal record for assaults and prostitutionrelated offences faces deportation to jamaica for a 1989 conviction christopher richard and simeon dillon three brothers who have been in canada for more than a decade also face deportation to jamaica for similar records in a few months of detentions and hearings immigration is accomplishing what the courts could not offering a permanent solution by kicking such people out of the country police hope immigrations tough stance will take up the slack of lenient court sentences says david olson assistant manager of ottawas immigration centre theyre saying if we send him a criminal to the kingston pen for five years hell be back on the streets but hey i can get rid of him for good if i call immigration but even local police who admit being thrilled at the prospect of getting rid of such troublemakers question the fairness of the process if a young person comes to canada is educated in canada grows up in canada and whether or not they ever take out citizenship and then later in life becomes a criminal i think its stupid to adopt the position that theyve got to be deported back to the country they left when they were an infant says skinner ottawacarleton police chief brian ford is concerned immigration authorities compensating for an inadequate response in the past may now be going overboard because fair is fair on human rights you have to have open fair hearings says ford when you close the doors you are open to abuses the broad parameters of the immigration act have allowed the department to scoop up people who may not have been convicted of a crime in years were getting into a dangerous area where there starts to be a visceral reaction to deporting individuals who may have been rehabilitated or may not have committed serious crimes at all says ottawa lawyer jonathan chaplan some of the convictions immigration is using to bring people before deportation proceedings date back 10 years says ottawa lawyer rene st fort under the immigration act a noncitizen can be deported if he has been convicted of a crime for which he served six months or for which a sentence of five years or more could have been imposed the lawyer prosecuting the case on behalf of immigration wins an order to deport simply by proving the permanent resident is not a citizen and that he or she has the kind of criminal conviction the act describes the hearings under this section are considered so partial that legal aid by policy will not provide counsel legal aid normally provides counsel to anyone who cant afford a lawyer theres nothing a lawyer can do explains keith wilkins legal aids area director because the legislation leaves the adjudicator no choice ive got to say it appears to work like a conveyor belt with little discretion conveying a person out the door out of the country without the procedural or humanitarian niceties legal aid therefore does not cover deportation inquiries and will cover only one detention review such reviews are to be held within the first 48 hours of incarceration then within seven days then every 30 days afterwards the act gives immigration canada many powers investigating arresting and detaining the immigration and refugee board a body independent of the department decides who is detained and deported and conducts appeals neither of these bodies is obliged to provide lawyers to people facing hearings although they have the discretion to do so the gap that leaves some detainees without legal help stuns skinner it flies in the face of almost every element of the canadian judicial system he says its a denial of fundamental rights the charter guarantees everyone the supreme court has ruled that the charter of rights and freedoms applies to everyone in the country citizen or not the immigration and refugee board in apparent contravention of its own act conducts deportation hearings privately in detention centres lawyer tallim says this points to the systems presumption of guilt where immigrants face hearings behind barred doors dressed in prison coveralls looking like criminals and alone when in fact their families are often outside waiting in the lobby of the jail and the board is holding more people in jail than ever before supt david gorman in charge of ottawacarletons detention centre says he was told by immigration officials at a conference in november to expect an increase in immigrationrelated detentions because of the toronto shootings one month later touring through the innes road facility he discovered these detentions had jumped to 32 from 20 at this time last year immigration board requests to hold hearings at the detention centre now arrive weekly quite often we dont receive a great deal of information on these cases to find out where these people might more appropriately be held says gorman he is reviewing why immigration detainees are kept in maximum security at torontos metro west detention centre the primary facility for immigration detainees in ontario the number of inmates held on immigration warrants most with no criminal charges against them has jumped since the summer to a daily average of between 90 and 100 compared with a daily average of 40 in the months before the shootings the detentions have contributed to overcrowding in the jail says deputy supt connie mahaffy many toronto immigration detainees have had to be bused to ottawacarleton and while most inmates on criminal charges remain at the centre for an average of 20 days mahaffy says those held through immigration remain incarcerated an average of 90 days gorman says such people also spend two to three times longer in jail than other inmates kellam says the average time spent in jail of an immigration detainee in 199394 was 26 days for 199495 the average so far is about 40 days our length of detentions is 50percent higher than it was one year ago kellam says and we are concerned about that the higher numbers of detainees have increased pressure on immigration creating a vicious circle kellam describes how adjudicators have been forced to spend so much time reviewing peoples detentions that actual hearings are being delayed extending the amount of time people are spending in jail kellam says the department is examining all cases in a onemonth period to see who is being held why and what can be done to avoid delays immigration adjudicators and criminal court judges are to detain people if they are deemed to be a threat to the public or if there is fear they will not appear for their next hearing but ottawa lawyer chaplan says he regularly sees cases where a judge has deemed a person fit to release on bail only to be told by an immigration adjudicator that the person is to be detained but if these people arent a danger to the public then its costing us a lot of money to house them he says in ontario it costs about 128 a day to house an inmate with a current high of 90 inmates a day at the metro west detention centre held through immigration each spending an average of 90 days in jail the bill to taxpayers is 1036800 immigration spent about 4 million keeping people jailed in ontario in 199394 in the first eight months of this fiscal year immigrations provincial budget was already spent kellam predicts it will cost more than 7 million before the fiscal year ends in march in one case ottawa lawyer st fort says he offered some 425000 in collateral to have a person released but the adjudicator declined he said he wasnt sure what would be a fair figure says st fort who is appealing the decision to a federal court adjudicators may be detaining people because of the recent intense public scrutiny they have to think can i live with this if this person gets out and does harm says judy paulsen manager at ottawas immigration centre but tallim says immigration adjudicators must rise above those concerns if people are influenced by public opinion how can they be considered unbiased jodoin of immigration enforcement makes no apologies for the stricter test adjudicators apply because the punishment imposed by criminal courts can be trivial compared to deportation which is in effect a life sentence if you go to a court to a judge and you get a conviction of two years then youre back out on the street what have you been deprived of jodoin says officials at the jamaican high commission are angry about the lengthy detentions of some awaiting deportation acting deputy high commissioner andrea crutchley says she is concerned by the cases of people held in maximum security who have no recent criminal convictions or current criminal charges weve called immigration officers to talk to them about people being treated unfairly to try to appeal to them on certain humanitarian grounds in certain cases she says sometimes these people are not being given a fair chance they are being treated like they are not humans lawyers accustomed to criminal court standards are appalled that since only two adjudicators cover eastern ontario decisions on detentions are usually reviewed by the same adjudicator who made the original ruling the most important decisions are those regarding a persons liberty says ottawa lawyer lawrence greenspon in the courts you would never go before the same judge on a detention review who ordered you detained in the first place there would be an appearance of bias you cant have that in the criminal courts and you shouldnt have it in the immigration system immigration board communications director david austin says theres little thats likely to change between one detention review and the next so theres no problem in the existing circumstances in the small chapel at the innes road detention centre where immigration hearings are held rules of evidence do not apply hearsay is admissable and criminal court acquittals are suspect here anything goes says lawyer st fort ive heard police giving testimony saying that well word on the street is to support their evidence i say i didnt hear that and he says looks to me like were not on the same street this should not be admissable transcripts of immigration hearings obtained by the citizen show examples of this sort of hearsay in a detention review hearing against the dillon brothers an rcmp officer testified the family was actually an organized crime group dealing in crackcocaine and prostitution he had no evidence of the allegations but said he was using information he had gathered through informants i am gathering information from source informants that they are involved in the dealing of drugs i am not here to prove that they are i am just here to say i am gathering information from different sources he told the hearing police agree immigration hearings accept and give weight to evidence that criminal courts discount but its a practice they say is worthwhile for too long these proceedings had only input from the other side police say now local police and rcmp note a growing trend on the part of immigration to have them testify at these hearings the lawyer who prosecutes the case for immigration reads statements of police summaries as fact and lawyers argue they have no way of finding out the basis of allegations chaplan says prosecuting lawyers cannot be crossexamined yet adjudicators unlike judges give their information significant weight the transcripts show that adjudicators do not view their quasijudicial system as being anything like the criminal courts in the detention review of the dillon brothers in november lawyer st fort objected to immigrations lawyer giving details of an alleged crime in which there was no conviction adjudicator annamaria micillo said of course convictions

213 of 997 documents legal monitor worldwide july 17 2013 wednesday immigration judges pushing for independence length 1219 words federal immigration judges are urging congress to liberate them from the department of justice a dramatic bid for independence that could eventually open immigration court records to the public for the first time in us history as lawmakers debate immigration legislation the judges have intensified lobbying efforts in washington with phone calls letters and personal trips to the capitol armed with support from national legal organizations including the american bar association and the federal bar association the judges say the backlogged immigration courts need the freedom to control their own budgets issue timely decisions and prevent unfair treatment of judges all things they maintain are not happening within the justice department bureaucracy the doj has contributed to selling the immigration courts short rather than defending their independence or enhancing their stature the judges union the national association of immigration judges said in a report given to congress this has serious and insidious repercussions a move out of the justice department could also allow immigration judges to decide which court records be kept from the public similar to regular courts the judges call for independence comes as labor unions in the department of homeland security which runs enforcement and citizenship services are calling on congress to fix immigration laws and be more transparent to the public traditional court records are public but immigration court and arrest records are generally confidential to protect the immigrants privacy somebody needs to flip the light switch on and make all of this stuff more visible said chris crane president of the national immigration and customs enforcement council which represents detention and deportation officers these people work for the taxpayers why should they be able to hide anything the judges lobbying is the latest sign of a glaring disconnect between the immigration officers on the front lines and the lawmakers in washington who are charting their future in a sometimes haphazard effort to fix the nations troubled immigration system and address the 11 million immigrants in the united states illegally the judges feel a sense of urgency because they fear that new immigration legislation if it passes could flood the courts with new cases their request for independence won little support from the senate which passed an immigration bill last month that ignored their request but now the judges are targeting the house its just been impossible to get the attention that we need and yet it is so counterintuitive because we are such an essential part of the process said immigration judge dana leigh marks president of the union which represents more than 200 judges in 59 courts nationwide its one of the keys to why the system keeps failing a senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said senators crafting the bill feared an independent court would be too costly the future of the senate bill is uncertain because house leaders have said they would not take it up and instead would focus on their own legislation the executive office for immigration review the justice department agency that runs the courts also raised concerns about the cost of an independent immigration court the office and the senate aide could not say how much the separate court would cost the type of civil administrative adjudications that the executive office for immigration review conducts are designed to be handled within the structure of the department and it would take significant resources to create an agency separate from an executive branch cabinet officer which we believe to be unnecessary at this time kathryn mattingly a spokeswoman for the office said in an email though they wear black robes and preside over courtrooms the judges are lawyers named by the attorney general the nations top prosecutor and the head of the department of justice it took over the courts from the department of labor in 1940 amid national security concerns during world war ii immigration judges have slowly gained prestige over the years in the earliest days they were merely hearing officers but later they were required to be lawyers in the 1970s they were referred to as judges a title that is now part of the law in 1983 the department of justice created the executive office for immigration review to run the courts giving the judges a measure of autonomy but the judges union told congress that the courts ties to the department of justice have damaged its credibility in documents to congress the union recited a litany of conflicts including the illegal recruiting of judges during the previous administration based on their political affiliations and the failure of the justice department to allow judges to hold people in contempt the union said some judges have even faced discipline for issuing unfavorable decisions as of june the courts had more than 300000 cases pending which the judges called a record high including more than 8000 in boston according to the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university at the same time immigration judges say they suffer burnout handling about 1500 cases each compared with 440 for federal judges in lifeordeath matters including immigrants facing deportation to countries where their lives might be in danger marks an immigration judge in san francisco said the congressional budget office should determine the cost of an independent court before lawmakers dismiss the proposal in its proposal the judges union urged congress to use its power under article 1 of the constitution to create an independent court of judges named by the president to a fixed term and confirmed by the senate those judges would not have lifetime tenure or the salary protections that regular federal judges have the judges modeled their proposal after the us tax court created in 1969 amid similar concerns about conflicts of interest under the department of treasury though tax court judges decisions and records are generally public professors said immigration court records would be open to the public only if congress or the judges made it so marks said it is likely the judges would follow the tradition of regular courts limiting access only to cases that would endanger someones safety we support the same amount of transparency that other courts receive she said the american immigration lawyers association has also backed the creation of an independent court if were going to put peoples futures in their hands then we need them to be a truly independent decision maker and not an arm of carrying out the policies of the justice department said crystal williams executive director for the immigration lawyers association others doubted the house and senate would change the immigration court system now since they cannot even agree on the broader issue of immigration overhaul i think its very unlikely said kent barnett assistant professor at the university of

words when the freighter golden venture ran aground off queens last weekend it sparked the latest crisis to confront an immigration agency that has lurched from controversy to controversy without a leader since president clinton took office at a most sensitive time in immigration history mr clinton has not yet nominated an immigration and naturalization service commissioner or publicly articulated an immigration policy distinct from his republican predecessor as most senior immigration jobs are empty the agency is being run by holdovers from the bush administration in washington and into the vacuum local ins directors career officials like william s slattery in new york have moved to reassert their power and lawenforcement priorities to be fair few recent presidents have rushed to fill the top ins job upon assuming office but the immigration issue carries a distinct urgency now from the outset of his presidency when mr clinton risked having his inaugural celebration disturbed by an exodus of haitian boat people one major problem after another has presented itself zoe bairds hiring of illegal immigrants the revelation of a world trade center bombing suspects entry into the country by claiming political asylum the golden venture and last weeks judicial order closing the detention camp for hivpositive haitians in guantanamo cuba extremely fragile moment its an extremely fragile moment for the agency to be rudderless said warren leiden executive director of the american immigration lawyers association in washington some of our most shameful exclusionary immigration laws have been passed at moments just like this when the country was suffering an economic downturn and foreigners were focused on as a threat while the white house has remained silent many immigration experts expect that mr clinton will nominate doris m meissner as commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service and they believe that the nomination is imminent ms meissner an immigration expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace was the acting commissioner and an associate executive commissioner of the ins under president reagan wellversed in immigration law and the arcane inner workings of the agency ms meissner is a safe choice both an insider and a knowledgeable expert fellow immigration specialists believe she will probably focus first on the management problems plaguing the agencys notoriously inefficient bureaucracy during this interim period however without a central office to rein them in local immigration directors have attempted to recapture some of the ground they lost under gene mcnary the commissioner under president bush mr mcnary had tried to curb the discretionary power of the local offices which historically made the agency a kingdom of barons without any monarch local directors felt that mr mcnary did not give a high enough priority to enforcement and paid too much attention to the agencys human rights responsibilities like running the political asylum system after the world trade center bombing and again after the grounding of the golden venture mr slattery seized the moment to make public appearances railing against the humanitarian leniencies of the asylum system while advocates for immigrants have long criticized the immigration and naturalization service for its backlogged system mr slattery and other officials turned the tables blaming the supposedly crafty immigrants who stormed the gates grabbing the initiative immigration lawyers in new york said it was unclear whether mr slattery had been instructed to make an example of the illegal chinese immigrants from the grounded freighter or whether he had grabbed the initiative to get tough himself by keeping them in detention centers slattery cannot not conceive of an alien who has a legitimate claim of persecution and he has been much admired during this interregnum by other career bureaucrats for reasserting the oldtimers cynicism about political asylum said arthur helton an immigration expert for the lawyers committee for international human rights rosemary laguardia a spokeswoman for mr slattery said he was traveling and could not be reached for comment as local immigration officials have tried to reassert their autonomy they have received mixed signals from the clinton administration about whether big change was really on the horizon immoral repatriation during the presidential campaign mr clinton criticized the bush administrations immoral repatriation of haitian boat people yet as president he embraced the same policy similarly mr clinton not only kept open the barbedwire detention camp for haitian refugees at the guantanamo naval base he also continued the bush administrations legal fight against closing it until a federal judge ordered the camp shut down last week its confusing to the country that the clinton administration now has a headless immigration agency which is continuing the discredited practices of bush said lucas guttentag who heads the immigration project at the american civil liberties union and from the opposite camp george high essentially agreed its very hard to

the immigration and naturalization service took advantage of the citys recent chaos by her own account police officers stopped her on the evening of may 4 told her she was going to get a free ride back to your country and handed her over to immigration agents who held her without charges for 18 days before a lawyer obtained her release mrs ramos who is from guatemala is part of one of the biggest hauls of illegal immigrants in the history of the city where thousands of newcomers live and work without documents among the legal hispanic residents in the weeks since the riots criticism has grown that the police and immigration agents improperly detained people although the officials deny it the critics say that hundreds of hispanic residents were interrogated about their immigration status on the basis of their race alone we were out there doing our job robert m moschorak the los angeles regional director of the immigration service said in a recent interview im very proud of the job we did 781 illegal aliens deported he denied that his agents had overstepped the law and he said many of the looters and lawbreakers had been illegal aliens as of last weekend his office said 944 people most of them from mexico had been taken into custody by the immigration service of these 781 waived their right to a deportation hearing and were immediately sent back across the mexican border critics of the roundup including immigrantrights group and civil liberties organizations as well as local hispanic officials say that rather than helping to restore order as it had been asked to do the immigration service saw a chance to pursue its own agenda we were a city in crisis and our politicians and police commission should not have allowed the enforcement of civil immigration violations to go hand in hand with attempts to calm down and defuse the situation said nils w frenzen directing attorney of public council a legal aid group these complaints were aired at a hearing last week of the police commission a civilian body that oversees the police force the commission president stanley k sheinbaum said the complaints would be investigated by a special commission studying police conduct during the rioting that began april 29 the day that four los angeles police officers were acquitted of severely beating a black motorist rodney g king as looters rampaged through stores the critics say the police and immigration officials were loading their vehicles with illegal aliens they had detained in a variety of improper ways in some cases like that of mrs ramos the critics say the police violated longstanding procedures by detaining people solely because they did not have documents to prove they were in the country legally the police denied this accusation immigrant rights groups have gathered numerous examples of men and women who say they were arrested without criminal charges for failing to produce immigration documents while shopping or waiting at bus stops or during searches for looted goods in their homes such police detentions on federal statutes would only be legal in rare circumstances in other cases as the police themselves confirm they handed over to the immigration service people who had been detained for looting or curfew violations but who normally would have been released for lack of strong evidence we had a large number about 100 out of 363 arrested for curfew violations and looted goods with status determined to be undocumented said capt dennis conti the commander of newton police station in a heavily hispanic area those were turned over directly to ins it speeds up the system agents accompanied officers such action violates a longstanding department policy of working hand in hand with immigration agents in still other cases the police said that immigration agents accompanied them in hispanic neighborhoods as interpreters critics say the agents took advantage of the situation to interrogate and detain people on the basis of their immigration status in one case e j flynn the legal director of the central american refugee center said a guatemalan he would identify only as miguel r was visiting his girlfriend when the police and immigration agents knocked on the door to search her apartment for looted goods he was detained when he was unable to prove that he was in the country legally using the required technical legal terms mr moschorak said people were asked to prove their immigration status only when specific articulable facts would lead an agent to believe that they were undocumented he said such facts could include things like speaking a foreign language wearing clothing that would basically be of foreign origin or foreign appearance if coupled with some of these other things he agreed that such a description could apply to vast portions of the citys population in which 40 percent of residents are of hispanic origin and hold a variety of immigration statuses in addition the critics say united states border patrol agents who joined the peacekeeping efforts in the city along with a number of other federal agencies were assigned to patrol hispanic neighborhoods where the effect of their presence was less to restore order than to sow fear federal lawenforcement forces have been deployed in our city to apprehend looters arsonists and murderers who have terrorized our community said city councilman mike hernandez one of several political leaders who spoke out against the activities of the immigration service they should not be here to arrest and detain lawabiding bystanders who may happen to be undocumented mr moschorak said about 400 agents of the border patrol were deployed in the city to assist in keeping order but that there is nothing to indicate that they arrested aliens who were illegally in the country only because they were illegally in the country stopped in the street when police officers turned their searchlight on mrs ramos and her husband as they were walking to a restaurant late at night in the aftermath of the rioting she said she did not know why they were stopping her the policewoman said what are you a prostitute how would you like a free ride back to your country mrs ramos said when she and her husband who worked as a security guard told the officers that they did not have immigration papers they were taken to a police station and turned over to the immigration service without being charged with any crime she said last weekend she was released pending a hearing because she is four months pregnant and was becoming ill said mr flynn who

column 1 metropolitan desk length 1101 words as the peak summer season approaches many international travelers passing through kennedy international airport at busy weekend arrival times are enduring long delays clearing immigration because of strict new inspection policies the waits stem from the immigration services decision to reinstitute its screening of united states citizens until january they had been allowed to bypass immigration and move directly to customs now american citizens arriving at kennedy wait an average of 20 to 30 minutes to clear immigration airport officials say largely because of more exacting screening foreigners wait about twice as long and on weekend afternoons when arrivals peak the waits are often more than doubled ron wexler a qualitycontrol analyst for an electronics company travels between new york and rome at least once a month although he spent only about 10 minutes in line in the immigration hall at the international arrivals building yesterday afternoon he said that on his last two trips he spent about 40 minutes waiting i dont think this is a good policy because it takes much longer and most of the waiting is just standing around in line he said it doesnt take long for them to look at your passport once you get up there warning of even longer delays with the arrival of summer customs and airport officials are demanding that the immigration and naturalization service abandon screening every passengers passport until the service can install computer technology to clear arriving travelers en route faster system starts next week we are anticipating a disaster situation with people waiting out on planes because the immigration area is so congested said david z plavin director of aviation for the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates kennedy the problems have not been confined to kennedy immigration officials began tougher screening at other international gates in 1989 and long waits have been reported in los angeles honolulu and other cities on thursday in the face of criticism across the nation the immigration service said it was taking steps to ease the crush starting next week the immigration authorities at international airports will be allowed to use a faster modified examination process during heavy arrival times said verne jervis a spokesman for the service instead of clearing every arriving united states citizens name through a computer inspectors will make selective checks like checking only the names of family heads or every fourth person mr jervis said the specifics will be left to the port directors but port authority officials say they are skeptical that the change will insure that all passengers clear all checks within 45 minutes as recommended by the international civil aviation organization if this does that well support it said armando arrastia a spokesman for the port authority the mathematics of the problem are simple many more passports are being examined by the same number of inspectors at kennedy half of the 52 immigration booths are now devoted solely to inspecting the passports of american citizens and passengers often must wait outside in the corridors before they can wait in the immigration line itself as long as 52 minutes on one unseasonably warm day in early april with the airconditioning system not yet operative we held passengers from 10 flights for as long as 52 minutes in the corridors mr plavin told members of the house immigration subcommittee during a hearing last month the immigration service says it began the stricter screenings because the customs service was not thorough enough in checking united states citizens its inspectors were looking only selectively at passports instead of checking each when we started surveying people to find out what citizens were being inspected we found that only 10 percent were being checked by customs said duke austin a spokesman for the immigration service customs said they couldnt do 100 percent but the law requires that all persons entering the country be checked the customs service which checks for drugs and other illegal imports and collects duties on goods bought abroad insists that its selective screening works both for detecting contraband and people without legitimate passports 70 percent more cocaine the screening identifies potential drug smugglers terrorists and other criminals based on certain indicators like whether the reasons for a passengers visit match its duration michael lovejoy the services program manager for airsea passenger operations said that using this system the customs service confiscated 70 percent more cocaine and 40 percent more heroin in 1990 than in 1989 port authority officials described the squabbling between immigration and customs as fingerpointing that obscured immigrations failure to hire a full contingent of inspectors to meet its increased requirements kennedy rarely has its full contingent of 342 inspectors because immigration officials have said the agency lacks the money but even though a 5 fee levied on passengers entering the country was extended last year to travelers from mexico the caribbean and canada to finance more inspectors 68 positions were vacant yesterday the immigration service said it planned to add 32 more inspectors on monday technology to the rescue airport officials expect technology to solve the problem eventually some airlines already use a system on flights from japan and europe called the advanced passenger information program it electronically transfers data on arriving passengers to the immigration service while the passengers are en route immigration officials run the information through computers so that when passengers land they have already cleared inspection at kennedy yesterday the stream of american citizens moved fairly steadily but the line for foreign citizens moved much more slowly and foreigners arriving on two jumbo jets around 3 pm filled the international side of the inspection hall foreign passengers however seemed much less agitated by the long lines than their american counterparts in italia its the same thing

section section 1 part 1 page 1 column 1 national desk length 1544 words dateline houston nov 11 in one of the most extensive immigration frauds ever perpetrated against the united states government thousands of people who falsified amnesty applications will begin to acquire permanent resident status next month under the 1986 immigration law more than 13 million illegal aliens applied to become legal immigrants under a onetime amnesty for farm workers the program was expected to accommodate only 250000 aliens when congress enacted it as a politically critical part of a sweeping package of changes in immigration law now a variety of estimates by federal officials and immigration experts place the number of fraudulent applications at somewhere between 250000 and 650000 lack of manpower and money the immigration and naturalization service has identified 398000 cases of possible fraud in the program but the agency admits that it lacks both the manpower and the money to prosecute individual applicants the agency is to begin issuing permanent resident status to amnesty applicants on dec 1 and officials said they were approving 94 percent of the applicants over all evidence of vast abuse of the farm worker amnesty program has already led to important changes in the way immigration policies are conceived in congress for example recent legislation to aid immigration by refugees from the soviet union was modified specifically to avoid the uncontrolled influx that has occurred under the agricultural amnesty program supporters of the farm worker amnesty argue that it accomplished its principal aim of insuring the nation a cheap reliable and legal supply of farm workers and that it made an inadvertent but important contribution in legitimizing a large part of the nations illegal alien population 1000 workers 30 acres critics point to cases like that of larry and sharon marval of newark last year they pleaded guilty to immigration fraud charges after immigration service investigators alleged that the marvals were part of an operation that helped about 1000 aliens acquire amnesty with falsified documents showing they had all worked on a mere 30 acres of farmland the amnesty for farm workers was a lastminute addition to the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which sought to halt illegal immigration with a twopart strategy under a general amnesty illegal aliens who could prove they had lived in the united states since before jan 1 1982 were given the chance to leave their underground existence and begin a process leading to permanent resident status and to stem further illegal immigration the employment of illegal aliens was made a crime the agricultural amnesty program was adopted at the insistence of politically powerful fruit and vegetable growers in california and texas who wanted to protect their labor force in several respects the provisions for the program were much less strict than the general amnesty program which drew 17 million applicants instead of having to document nearly five years of continuous residence most agricultural worker applicants had to show only that they had done 90 days of farm work between may 1 1985 and may 1 1986 representative charles e schumer a brooklyn democrat who was an author of this special agricultural worker provision said that in retrospect the program seemed too open and susceptible to fraud but he argued that budget decisions had made the battle to combat fraud more difficult there has not been enough diligence in tracking down the fraud he said because funding for the ins has been cut by the white house in each of the last three budgets even though everyone agreed when the bill passed that greater ins manpower was essential to make it work congress rarely raises the immigration service budget above administration requests aside from its budget problems the immigration service has repeatedly come under fire this year in congress and in an audit by the justice department for what was termed mismanagement and administrative inefficiency john f shaw assistant immigration commissioner agreed that manpower restrictions at the agency were a major factor in the fraud in the agricultural amnesty program he said much of the fraud shot through a window of opportunity when the agency was frantically trying to deal with many new burdens of the 1986 immigration law people who sold false documents mr shaw said lawenforcement efforts had been limited to the people who sold false documents to applicants for the farm worker amnesty the immigration service has made 844 arrests and won 413 convictions in cases alleging fraud in the amnesty program the people involved ranged from notaries public to field crew leaders it was a cottage industry mr shaw said the immigration service can revoke legal status if it finds the applicant committed fraud but even this effort is limited only applications that appear linked to a fraud conspiracy are held for review as when an unusually large number of applicants assert that they have worked in same place some 398000 aliens have fallen into this category since the application period ended last nov 30 but it is likely that many of them will get resident status mr shaw said the fraud conspiracies often involved farms that actually did employ some migrant labor so it is frequently impossible to separate legitimate from illicit claims given the limited lawenforcement effort no precise count of fraud in the agricultural amnesty program is possible but some rough estimates are possible based on information from the aliens themselves an extensive survey conducted in three rural mexican communities by the center for usmexican studies at the university of california in san diego found that only 72 percent of those who identified themselves as applicants for farm worker amnesty had work histories that qualified them for the program a similar survey conducted by mexican researchers in jalisco in central mexico found that only 59 percent qualified but fraud alone does not explain why the program produced more than five times the applicants congress expected frank d bean codirector of the program for research on immigration policy at the urban institute in washington said the miscalculation in the special agricultural worker program reflected longstanding difficulties in tracking the number of temporary illegal migrants from mexico it is at least plausible that a very large percentage of the saw applicants had done agricultural work in the us even if they did not meet the specific time requirements of the amnesty mr bean said it was a weak program mr shaw of the immigration service and other critics of the law believe there were more fundamental flaws it was a weak program and it was poorly articulated in the law he said unlike almost all other immigration programs which put the burden of proof on the applicant the farm amnesty put the burden on the government consequently aliens with even the most rudimentary documentation cannot be rejected unless the government can prove their claims are false stephen rosenbaum staff attorney for california rural legal assistance a nonprofit service organization for farm workers argued that there was no other way to structure an immigration program for an occupation that does not produce a paper trail he noted that farm workers are paid in cash and neither the employers nor the workers keep detailed records immense logistical problems you can argue the wisdom of a farm worker amnesty but if you have one you have to recognize the immense logistical problems involved in producing evidence he said the immigration service at first tried to apply the stringent practices common to other immigration programs like rejecting applicants with little explanation when their documents were suspect but three lawsuits brought in florida texas and california over the last two years forced the agency to follow the broader standards mandated by congress the burdenofproof issue arose again earlier this year when the house of representatives approved legislation that would have made any person who could prove soviet citizenship eligible for political refugee status a legislator with a powerful role on immigration policy senator alan k simpson republican of wyoming eliminated the provision because of concerns raised by the farm worker amnesty program an aide said mr simpson who is on the senate judiciary subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs substituted a series of specific circumstances that had to be met for a soviet citizen to be considered a refugee like denial of a particular job because of religious beliefs immigration experts believe that the agricultural amnesty program will probably color policy debates over other categories of aliens whose qualifications will be difficult to document like the antisandinista rebels of nicaragua one certain product of the agricultural amnesty

section 1 part 1 page 20 column 1 national desk length 880 words dateline washington april 18 the government has named border patrol agents investigators deportation officers and other enforcement personnel to review applications from illegal aliens seeking legal status under the new immigration law the assignments have caused concern among immigration lawyers hispanic groups and religious organizations which fear that some of the officials because of their lawenforcement background will be hostile to aliens immigration officials said that the fears were unfounded and that data submitted on applications for legal status would not be used to deport illegal aliens the law requires that such information be kept confidential unless an alien has knowingly made false statements in an application the law of the land however the officials acknowledged that the law would require major changes in attitude for many employees of the immigration and naturalization service the success of the law depends on such changes immigration experts said alfred j heitzmann was an immigration investigator for 13 years and a border patrol agent for 9 years before he retired he was called back to be deputy chief of the government office that will review applications from illegal aliens in new orleans its a 180degree change mr heitzmann said i spent 22 years of my life apprehending and ejecting illegal aliens will i have a problem now legalizing them no this program is the law of the land and i am sworn to uphold it on may 5 the immigration service will open 107 offices around the country to accept applications from illegal aliens the office for washington and virginia is to be headed by bruce chadbourne who was a deportation officer until a few months ago the manager of the

legalization for the eastern region which covers 13 states spent 29 years in the immigration service serving as a border patrol agent intelligence officer investigator and associate regional commissioner for enforcement among other jobs he said his goal now was to legalize as many aliens as possible sam bernsen an immigration lawyer said the selection of enforcement personnel to run the legalization program was a mistake these people are likely to be perceived as hostile to illegal aliens said mr bernsen who worked at the immigration service for more than 35 years in various jobs including general counsel as a result aliens will be apprehensive and may be afraid to apply charles c foster of houston a former president of the american immigration lawyers association said a person who has spent his life trying to detect detain and deport aliens will have mixed feelings about trying to administer the legalization program in a generous fashion as congress intended richard e norton associate commissioner of the immigration service said the people running the program understand that the ins has different missions and wears different hats many have experience serving the public and reviewing aliens applications for citizenship or other benefits he said new law offers amnesty a federal advisory committee that studied immigration policy said in 1981 that the public service and lawenforcement functions of the ins should be separated to the greatest extent possible but that has not occurred the new law prohibits employers from hiring illegal aliens but offers legal status or amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the united states before jan 1 1982 and have resided here continuously since then the application period lasts to may 4 1988 the government expects applications from four million illegal aliens under the program illegal aliens may become lawful temporary residents of the united states after 18 months in that status they may apply for permanent residence after five years as permanent residents they may apply for united states citizenship in preparing their applications many illegal aliens will receive help from nonprofit groups like the united states catholic conference the social action arm of the roman catholic church gilbert paul carrasco an immigration lawyer at the catholic conference said he had very serious concern that immigration officials would maintain their lawenforcement perspective in the legalization program problems of documentation this is a benefits program and is supposed to be liberally construed he said the law will require a major psychological change for many aliens too after living in the united states for years as undocumented workers trying to conceal their illegal status they must now find documents to prove they have been here in an unlawful status since 1982 muzaffar a chishti a lawyer with the international ladies garment workers union said that thousands of illegal aliens would have

see an open door to legal status for aliens eligible for amnesty instead he sees what most of his clients do a tantalizing quest full of great risks demands and rewards the immigration service has never been santa claus and it never will be said mr montemayor who has practiced immigration law since 1969 in san antonio and before that spent seven years as a lawyer with the immigration and naturalization service this is not come in and get your visa mr montemayor continued people are going to have to prove their case and i mean by documented evidence and if they cant they will be out of here a lot of people are offering advice right now who dont know anything about immigration law and they are going to do people are lot more harm than good many being victimized mr montemayors skepticism reflects the widespread legal and personal uncertainties since the passage of the law which is taxing the resources of the immigration bar and demanding painful choices from illegal aliens willing to apply for amnesty already many aliens have been victimized by unscrupulous or untrained legal advisors who charge stiff fees for legal aid they cannot deliver according to groups that work with aliens others are desperately trying to document their residence after years of trying to live invisibly and all are weighing the advantages of legal status against the risks of revealing themselves for the first time to a judicial system that in the past has been responsible for deporting them immigration officials say enforcement agents will not have access to rejected applications for amnesty but many aliens and some of their lawyers doubt it some lawyers say aliens unlikely to make it through the system safely either because of residency problems or an inability to show proficiency in english should not take the risk key part effective in may if they arent going to be able to pass the exam i wont take their cases said ralph garcia an el paso immigration lawyer otherwise im just going to be reporting them to immigration the most publicized part of the new law the offer of amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the united states before jan 1 1982 and have been here continuously since then does not go into effect until may 5 and the regulations specifying the documentation required are not expected until later this month the immigration service will later open 100 offices around the country to accept applications many illegal aliens wary of getting enmeshed in a system they have tried to evade all their lives are not going to apply for amnesty no matter what their chances lawyers and immigration officials say some think there will be far fewer applications for amnesty than expected estimates on aliens vary alan c nelson commissioner of immigration and naturalization said last week that his agency estimated as many 39 million illegal aliens might apply for amnesty under the new law officials say that estimate could be high adding that there was no way to reach a reliable estimate the census bureau estimates 3 million to 5 million illegal aliens live in the united states not all of them would be eligible under the amnesty program the immigration service estimates there are 65 million to 7 millon illegal aliens in the country employers unsure of their responsibilities under the new law aggrieved workers who believe they have been illegally dismissed since the laws passage and aliens curious about the options are already flocking to lawyers legal clinics and social service centers around the country but it is not just immigration lawyers who are offering advice in cities all over aliens are paying stiff fees to notaries public to prepare forms for them in central america notaries are local officials of great influence and administrative power in the united states they generally do little more than verify signatures for a minimal fee or none immigration experts say illegal aliens are paying fees ranging from 100 to more than 1000 to notaries thinking they are dealing with influential lawyers able to aid their case they get 50 calls a day its been crazy said cheryl little a lawyer with the haitian refugee center in miami she said two lawyers and two paralegal workers were answering calls from 50 haitians a day including some who had paid fees to notaries the notaries are taking their money and theyre not completing the forms we have so many questions about whats going on but notaries have no monopoly on worthless information lawyers in orange county in california say packets of bogus documents such as rent receipts and bills are being sold on the streets for 100 the situation is particularly troublesome on the border with mexico where mexican lawyers are advertising their services

pretty quick here said the rev peter zendzian director of the northeast regional immigration office for the united states catholic conference migration refugee service in new york all you need is one person to say hey this guy can help and hes in business these people have been afraid for a long time theyve been looking for a long time to get themselves straightened out so theyll gladly pay the

interest in immigration law which has largely been viewed as a highvolume lowglamour section of the legal profession membership in the 40yearold american immigration lawyers association has increased from 1000 members in may 1979 to 2100 members now in california the immigration bar has virtually quadrupled since 1980 in 1980 there were 112 members of the immigration law section of the los angeles county bar association today there are more than 425 some of them practice immigration law full time and others on an occasional basis said lawrence liebenbaum who heads the immigration section but immigration lawyers say many lawyers with no knowledge of the field are flocking in mr montemayor says he gets 5 or 10 calls a week from lawyers thinking about taking up immigration practice fees will not be minimal lawyers worry however whether adequate legal help will be available for those most in need because the fees for a family with a straightforward application will be at least 500 to 1000 aliens applying for amnesty will also have to pay a fee which has not yet been set to the immigration service to cover the cost of the program immigration lawyers expect the fee to be less than 100 immigration officials say they want to keep the fee low and the program affordable but they want the program to be financed entirely by applicant fees in houston many immigration lawyers say they are seeing a moderate increase in business because of the new law jose medina a noted immigration lawyer said he saw 15 to 20 people a week as a result of the new law he thinks that in the city there may be 25000 amnesty applications lawyers at carecen the legal arm of crecen a central american refugee service center say their work load has doubled margaret burkhart a lawyer with caracen said that if the organization and other nonprofit legal centers doubled their staffs they could handle 4000 applications in the next year a drop in the bucket thats a drop in the bucket she said she estimates as many as 100000 people in houston could qualify for amnesty craig h baab staff director for the coordinating committee on immigration law of the american bar association said the association was hoping to set up a nationwide network of lawyers to do volunteer work for aliens going through the amnesty program he said the aba was also putting together some brochures to help people understand the law people have to have access to sound legal advice he said unfortunately weve already heard of people without any experience giving out bad advice and charging to boot theres a lot of confusion we want to tell people to relax calm down dont let anyone take you to the cleaners the law doesnt go into effect until may documents a big obstacle lawyers say the biggest obstacle will be adequate documentation which could help prolong cases and make the legal logjam even worse jonathan lamb a houston immigration lawyer estimates 80 percent of those eligible for legalization will have moderate to severe document problems in advance of regulations on documentation lawyers are generally advising clients to gather rent receipts telephone bills pay checks affidavits from neighbors and any other documents they can put together to verify their presence in the united states lawrence durnford an immigration lawyer in el paso gives all clients a list in english and spanish of possible documentation ranging from the standard ones like rent receipts and utilty deposits to less likely ones like church membership and membership in clubs athletic teams organizations and unions he said

times section section a page 1 column 3 national desk length 929 words dateline washington oct 20 federal officials say they are investigating a substantial number of lawyers who specialize in immigration as part of a wide inquiry into fraudulent schemes to obtain visas work permits and other benefits for aliens officials of the immigration and naturalization service have declined to give a specific number of cases under investigation other than to say that there are several dozen the service says immigration fraud is widespread its officials say it is concentrating its inquiry on marriage fraud and fraudulent applications for permission to work in the united states immigration lawyers object immigration lawyers say the governments assertions about the extent of fraud are unproved and the investigations are meant to discourage lawyers from representating aliens vigorously they also strenuously object to the governments investigative tactics the government has already brought charges or taken other legal actions against some lawyers dale m schwartz of atlanta presidentelect of the american immigration lawyers association was recently indicted by a federal grand jury on eight counts of mail fraud and false statements in a case involving a british businessman who came to the united states to work for an american aerospace company release of 3000 cubans mr schwartz pleaded not guilty last week in the last four years he has become prominent by representing cubans who resist deportation as a result of his efforts more than 3000 cubans have been released from the federal penitentiary in atlanta in houston two lawyers were recently sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after they pleaded guilty to three criminal counts arising from what was termed a fraudulent scheme to get work visas for clients in boston a federal grand jury has subpoenaed the records of a private law firm and a legal service clinic staffed by harvard law students who help represent aliens in immigration cases a federal district judge quashed the subpoena as a violation of attorneyclient confidentiality the justice department has asked the judge to reconsider saying the files might show that the lawyers helped their clients make false statements commit perjury and evade the immigration law the government says the lawyers may have turned a blind eye to obvious indications of their clients fraud deborah e anker an instructor at the clinic and at harvard law school denied the allegations and said that such subpoenas would discourage lawyers from aggressively representing aliens an already vulnerable and underrepresented class sam bernsen a retired general counsel of the immigration service said it is highly questionable whether these alleged violations are really criminal in nature the immigration law is monstrously complex much of it depends on the aliens intent whether he intends to come here temporarily or permanently john f shaw chief of investigations for the immigration service said the agency was focusing on two types of abuse marriage fraud which occurs when an alien engages in a sham marriage to an american citizen to get an immigrant visa and false statements to help an alien enter the united states for a specific job permanent visas to workers before aliens can get permanent visas to work in the united states the labor department must determine whether americans are available to do the job the alien would take and whether employing the alien would adversely affect americans wages and working conditions in similar jobs if the answer to both questions is no the department issues a labor certification facilitating the aliens entry the government contends that in many cases employers and their attorneys have improperly written job descriptions to eliminate qualified american workers from consideration michael f treworgy regional inspector general of the labor department in dallas said that in his region which covers 11 states the authorities are investigating more than a dozen cases of suspected fraud involving lawyers aliens and employers agents of the labor department the immigration service and the federal bureau of investigation are cooperating on similar inquiries in other parts of the country according to their officials gimmicking the system we did not intend to single out immigration lawyers mr shaw said we are looking at fraudulent petitions for benefits under the immigration law if that leads to lawyers so be it we look on many members of the immigration bar as people who are gimmicking the system immigration lawyers acknowledged that it was the governments duty to investigate wrongdoing but several said they were furious about the tactics federal agents used to question the lawyers allen e kaye of new york city a former president of the immigration lawyers association said that federal agents had tried to gain the cooperation of aliens and employers by telling them in effect we are investigating your lawyer not you he said the agents also urged the clients not to tell their lawyers they had been interviewed by federal agents maurice c inman the current general counsel of the immigration service said the indictment of mr schwartz was definitely not related to his representing the cubans but mr schwartz said these investigations of lawyers have no real purpose other than to intimidate attorneys and their clients and thus to deprive aliens and their sponsors of the effective assistance of counsel language english 
955 of 997 documents the new york times september 9 1985 monday late city final edition men only a third of us immigrants byline by robert pear special to the new york times section section a page 15 column 1 national desk length 822 words dateline washington sept 8 a new labor department study says that women and children account for twothirds of all legal immigration to the united states contrary to conventional wisdom the stereotypical view of immigrants as young workingage men who leave their homelands seeking economic opportunity is a correct picture of immigration in nearly all other countries the report said but it said that in recent years as in the last five decades the traditional workingage immigrant male has accounted for only a third of all immigration to the united states the american trend had gone virtually unnoticed by researchers and government officials but may have major implications for immigration policy if the number of immigrants entering the labor market is smaller than had been assumed the adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of american workers would be less than many people had believed on the other hand immigration would probably not generate as much economic growth if there were fewer immigrants working in this country the authors said they were surprised by the findings of the study the first to compile and analyze immigration data by sex in view of the new data they said the effect of immigration on the american labor market may have been overestimated and almost certainly has been miscast pattern called unique legal immigration averaged 433600 a year in the 1970s and the annual average has been 566600 in the last five years since 1930 it said more than half of all immigrants to the united states have been female and twothirds have been women or children the unvarying predominance of female immigrants appears unique it said other international migration flows are still generally dominated by males officials had assumed that most immigrants went to work soon after entering the united states actually the study said children represent onefourth of all immigrants and elderly immigrants most of whom are women may never enter the labor market jeffrey s passel a census bureau demographer who specializes in immigration said the labor department study showed that the traditional picture of immigration is different from the reality over the last 50 years the dominance of women and children he said is a point that almost everybody has overlooked the study was written by marion f houstoun roger g kramer and joan m barrett immigration specialists at the labor department authors cite reasons for pattern they listed several reasons for the female predominance in immigration to this country united states immigration policy strongly favors reunification of families they observed immigration laws have become more restrictive over the last 50 years they said but there is no numerical limit on immigration of aliens who are immediate relatives of united states citizens most of the immediate relatives are women because american men are much more likely than women to marry aliens in addition the study said more mothers than fathers immigrated to the united states to be reunited with their us citizen children women tend to live longer than men it noted and most of the women immigrants in this category were widowed mothers joining their children in the united states united states citizens also adopted more girls than boys from overseas the study said that more girls were available for adoption from abroad and that americans seeking to adopt aliens showed an overwhelming preference for girls the authors said they did not know the reason for this preference roger l conner the executive director of the federation for american immigration reform a nonprofit group that lobbies for more restrictive immigration policies said the study showed that the overwhelming majority of immigrants who enter the united states today come to complete a family rather than to work little data on illegal migrants the study which is being published in the international migration review a professional journal did not discuss illegal immigration for which there are no authoritative statistics mrs houstoun said in an interview this week illegal immigration is dominated by men however in recent years there seem to be increasing numbers of illegal alien women and the proportion of women among illegal migrants is also increasing the labor department study said that women dominated legal immigration to the united states from europe and southeast asia while men dominated immigration from africa and the middle east in the last decade it said women accounted for 72 percent of the immigrants from finland and west germany 69 percent of those from thailand 67 percent from japan and 62 percent from sweden by contrast women accounted for only 13 percent of immigration from yemen 32 percent from nigeria and 34 percent from ghana language english

216 of 997 documents tampa bay times july 9 2013 tuesday politifactcom edition dan stein says senate immigration bill would add 70 million americans over 20 years byline louis jacobson section politifact length 1083 words the senate immigration bill unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration É were talking about a population increase under the senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years dan stein on sunday july 7th 2013 in an interview on cbs face the nation the ruling false as the immigration debate moves from the senate to the house supporters and opponents have been firing claims back and forth a reader pointed us toward one claim raised by a critic of the bill on cbs face the nation the socalled path to citizenship amnesty program is a fraction of what the deal bills with said dan stein who heads a group that opposes the bill the federation for american immigration reform or fair on july 7 2013 ultimately it unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration essentially it gives up on the american worker by simply suggesting that at every level of the labor market employers should be able to bring in foreign workers were talking about a population increase under the senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years 70 million people the reader wondered whether the bill really unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration of over 70 million people in 20 years in asking us to check the item the reader noted that such an increase in the immigrant population would amount to a 22 percent increase over the current us population estimate of 3163 million an increase the reader said sounds implausibly high as support for steins claim eric ruark fairs director of research pointed us to a paper by the center for immigration studies while the center has strong opinions on immigration policy its generally skeptical of expanding immigration the groups study used data from two sources without a dog in the fight the congressional budget office and the census bureau the paper noted that cbo in a recent analysis of the immigration bill projected that the us will have 162 million more people in 2033 as a result of the immigration bill than it would if congress passed no changes to the immigration system cbo said this is primarily because the legislation would loosen or eliminate annual limits on various categories of permanent and temporary immigration meanwhile the census bureau has projected that the us population on its own and in the absence of an immigration bill was already set to rise from 3163 million in 2013 to 3653 million in 2033 thats an increase of 49 million if you add these two numbers together you get a roughly 65 million increase in population thats pretty close to steins 70 million figure steins comments suggested to us and to the reader who urged us to check the claim that its the immigration bill that caused the 70 million increase but thats not the case in reality roughly threequarters of the 65 million population increase from 2013 to 2033 comes not from additional immigrants crossing the border and having children on us soil but rather from americans already legally on us soil having kids and from immigrants coming to the us legally under current laws the senate bill wouldnt affect this population growth at all several population experts told politifact that they had problems with steins claim i dont see where the 70 million would come from certainly not from the countries mostly responsible for undocumented migration said douglas massey a professor at princeton universitys office of population research together mexico el salvador guatemala and honduras account for around threefourths of all undocumented residents but the combined population of these countries is only around 150 million so 70 million moving here would represent 47 percent of their combined population which is simply not credible in an interview steven a camarota the author of the center for immigration studies paper declined to assess the adequacy of how stein phrased the statistic however he said its not unreasonable to focus on the impact of immigration on the nations population growth even if the number isnt as high as 70 million the basic question remains is 16 million additional residents a lot camarota said this is on top of the 19 million from current immigration levels the key question is what are the costs and benefits of significantly increasing the size and density of the us population as a direct result of federal policy the country lacks even a terse discussion of this issue our ruling stein said the senate immigration bill unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration É were talking about a population increase under the senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years while credible estimates do say the us population could grow by 65 million between 2013 and 2033 only about 16 million of that would be increases resulting from the senate bill the remaining 49 million or threequarters of the total would come from natural population growth among people already in america and by immigration thats deemed legal under todays laws

220 of 997 documents the new york times june 19 2013 wednesday late edition final immigration law changes seen cutting billions from deficit byline by ashley parker erin banco contributed reporting section section a column 0 national desk pg 17 length 1057 words washington congressional budget analysts providing a positive economic assessment of proposed immigration law changes said tuesday that legislation to overhaul the nations immigration system would cut close to 1 trillion from the federal deficit over the next two decades and lead to more than 10 million new legal residents in the country a longawaited analysis by the congressional budget office found that the benefits of an increase in legal residents from immigration legislation currently being debated in the senate which includes a pathway to citizenship would outweigh the costs while the report was a clear victory for immigration proponents it came just hours after speaker john a boehner raised potential new obstacles for the bill saying he would not bring any immigration measure to the floor unless it had the support of a majority of house republicans the report estimates that in the first decade after the immigration bill is carried out the net effect of adding millions of additional taxpayers would decrease the federal budget deficit by 197 billion over the next decade the report found the deficit reduction would be even greater an estimated 700 billion from 2024 to 2033 the deficit reduction figures for the first decade do not take into account 22 billion in the discretionary spending required to implement the bill however making the savings slightly lower the report was immediately seized on by backers of the bill as a significant boost to its prospects senator charles e schumer democrat of new york one of the bills authors said the report debunks the idea that immigration reform is anything other than a boon to our economy the budget office also found that in the next decade the legislation would lead to a net increase of about 104 million permanent legal residents and 16 million temporary workers and their dependents as well as a decrease of about 16 million unauthorized residents conservatives had expected that an analysis of the second decade when immigrants would begin to qualify for federal benefits would bolster their argument that the costs of an immigration overhaul were unwieldy but that turned out not to be the case in the economic analysis senator jeff sessions republican of alabama a leading opponent of the bill said that its authors used scoring gimmicks in order to conceal the true cost from taxpayers as a result the score effectively conceals some of the biggest longterm costs to taxpayers contained in this legislation including providing illegal immigrants with medicaid food stamps and cash welfare mr sessions said earlier tuesday mr boehner republican of ohio tried to put to rest discussion that he would consider pushing through an immigration bill with a combination of democrats and a minority of receptive republicans in the house where conservative republican sentiment runs strongly against allowing those who entered the country illegally to qualify for legal status i also suggested to our members today that any immigration reform bill that is going to go into law ought to have a majority of both parties support if were really serious about making that happen and so i dont see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesnt have a majority support of republicans mr boehner said at a news conference after meeting with house republicans mr boehners comments both privately in the meeting at the capitol hill club and publicly came as some house republicans have begun to draw a firm and vocal line in the sand warning mr boehner that his speakership could be at risk if he tries to force through an immigration bill without his conferences support in an interview with world net daily radio on monday representative dana rohrabacher republican of california said mr boehner should be removed as speaker if on immigration he violates the hastert rule an unofficial principle named for j dennis hastert a former republican speaker who would rarely allow a vote on a bill that did not have the support of a majority of his conference though mr boehner has passed measures with a minority of republicans several times this year to help avert a fiscal showdown provide relief for victims of hurricane sandy and pass the violence against women act he explicitly said on tuesday that he would not take up an immigration bill without the support of a majority of his party mr boehners comments will make it harder for him to buck conservatives on an immigration overhaul something that many party leaders consider crucial for republicans hoping to regain their national standing with hispanic voters his position will also make it harder to strike a deal between the house and the senate on a final immigration measure if the legislative process gets that far in insisting on a measure that most of his members can support mr boehner is calling for legislation that is likely to contain border security requirements and limits on attaining legal status that many democrats and other proponents of new legislation will resist mr boehner is well aware of the difficult political situation he finds himself in when asked if he believed he could lose his job if he violated the hastert rule on immigration he said to laughter maybe mr boehner would not initially say whether he would also require majority republican support on any legislation to emerge from negotiations with the senate over a final bill well see when we get there he said but his staff later clarified that he would not violate the hastert rule on anything coming out of conference either mr boehners comments come as conservative republicans are increasingly worried about how the immigration bill will be handled in

221 of 997 documents the christian science monitor june 18 2013 tuesday on immigration reform house gop plays hardball on enforcement house republicans open their bid to overhaul the us immigration system by giving local law officers more authority to enforce immigration laws in sharp contrast with the senate bill byline david grant staff writer section usa length 1105 words rep bob goodlatte chairman of the house judiciary committee is expected to hurl a brushback pitch to congressional democrats on tuesday when his committee takes up a tough immigration enforcement measure as the houses first official step toward immigration reform specifically the measure would empower state and local governments to take part in enforcing federal immigration law and it is expected to pass why is representative goodlatte taking a step that many democrats on his committee and immigration advocates see as provocative just like a fastball high and inside its about sending a signal enforcing immigration laws in americas interior is the place where we think the senate bill is absolutely the weakest and it is the place where in 1986 there was an easy pathway to citizenship for 3 million people and then enforcement never really happened says goodlatte referring to the last year in which congress approved comprehensive immigration reform legislation we hope this topic will be highlighted because we think its been neglected in other places he adds while tuesdays first pitch is hard to handle and is generating a storm of vituperation from the left goodlatte says republicans arent singularly interested in hardball in fact in the weeks to come goodlatte plans to move a bill offering a way for some 11 million undocumented people already in the us to become permanent residents and citizens a central component for immigration reform for his democratic colleagues in the senates comprehensive reform bill a nationwide everify system for determining a prospective employees true identity is the main interior enforcement measure by contrast the house safe act cosponsored by goodlatte and rep trey gowdy r of south carolina will allow state and local public safety authorities to take on some immigrationenforcement roles other provisions include beefing up the weapons and body armor available to some federal immigration enforcers the legislation will be amended and probably approve on tuesday morning in a panel that tilts heavily toward republicans thats the controversial approach that had hardedged application by state governments such as arizonas the states immigration law known as sb 1070 was struck down in part by the us supreme court last year because it attempted to overstep federal immigration authority gop presidential contender mitt romney endorsed the arizona law as a model for national immigration policy and was summarily walloped by president obama among hispanic voters goodlatte says he understands the passions such proposals stir in democrats but that avoiding a repetition of the 1986 immigration amnesty burns just as hot for republicans whereas democrats and immigrant advocates see the house bill as a backtothefuture moment for republican politics goodlatte sees delegating some enforcement authority away from the federal government as a check on future presidents of either party if were going to have meaningful immigration reform its got to include a strong enforcement component that doesnt allow the president of the united states the ability to flip a switch and say were not going to enforce this or that area of immigration law he says will goodlattes pitch empty the proverbial benches for an allout brawl no punches are being thrown yet but democrats and immigration reform advocates are snarling at the lip of the dugout some advocates say republicans just didnt learn their lesson from the 2012 election with simon rosenberg founder of the new democratic network calling the house bill an ideological necessity for those on the right who are fighting to rebuild mr romneys immigration strategy of selfdeportation from the ashes of its charring at the supreme court and at the ballot box some say republicans are simply staking out a position for maximum negotiating leverage if or when both chambers pass immigration legislation i understand the political fallout from the immigration reform debate that some of these folks feel like they need cover said tony martinez mayor of brownsville texas a city near the usmexico border in a conference call with reporters on monday i certainly understand the political aspect of it thats fine get it out there i dont think its going anywhere but what really concerns democrats is that the first bill may be a sign of things to come that is of a house gop majority interested only in moving measures that are anathema to the left and that are aimed at blowing up the fragile bipartisan détente over immigration issues on capitol hill the approach this bill takes is dangerous and wrong and i hope todays hearing is not a sign of the direction in which this committee is heading said rep zoe lofgren d of california one of seven lawmakers engaged in a bipartisan effort to craft a comprehensive immigration fix in the house at a hearing on the bill last week on monday goodlatte said fears that the immigration process is heading in a partisan direction are misguided having already written bills on many of the major pieces of immigration reform through standalone measures everify border security agricultural workers highskilled workers goodlatte says several more bills are in the works and will pass through his committee in weeks to come the next batch of bills will include one to provide a framework for legalizing the nations 11 million undocumented residents he says goodlatte who believes that such a framework could end in citizenship for some of the undocumented says hes looking to representative lofgrens bipartisan working group of seven lawmakers to help strike the balance on a pathway to citizenship but without an agreement from the bipartisan house immigration group which has neither broken up nor yet produced a final bill despite hints of either outcome for several weeks goodlatte is left waiting we dont have the vehicle to move forward with he says whatever happens with the bipartisan group however he says he will eventually find a legislative ride for the path to citizenship you cant win after all throwing only high and inside we are definitely interested in addressing that area as well because we dont think that the interior enforcement provisions that were working on in this bill given the democrats resistance to them are likely to become law unless they are a part of a larger overall agreement goodlatte says thats been the plan from the outset but exactly how the pieces will fit together is still not known loaddate june 18 2013 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2013

222 of 997 documents the washington times june 17 2013 monday immigration courts need an upgrade independence from the justice department would increase effectiveness byline by bill mccollum special to the washington times section b commentary pg 3 length 955 words for years the need for an immigration court has been obvious but it has gone unmet as major immigrationreform legislation moves through congress now is the time to create the court under terms in article 1 of the us constitution it may not be a sensational topic or one that inspires heated debate but it is essential to reform it has widespread support in the legal community and it would result in enhanced due process protections and provide an enforcement mechanism which would reduce appeals and delay today immigration judges are classified as attorneys working for the justice department in the executive office for immigration review they are highly specialized with tremendous responsibilities but with no true judicial independence immigration courts are the triallevel tribunals that determine if an individual is in the united states illegally and if so whether there is any status or benefit to which the individual is entitled most frequently matters before immigration judges are initiated by immigration and customs enforcement trial attorneys in the department of homeland security seeking deportation or removal of an individual caseloads are at an alltime high currently there are approximately 327000 cases pending for 256 immigration judges nationwide an average of 1277 pending cases per judge compared with 440 per us district court judge immigration courts are dramatically understaffed one judicial law clerk for every four judges unlike district court judges who have two or three per judge sixty percent of respondents are unrepresented by counsel and 85 percent of detained respondents are unrepresented because these are civil proceedings with no right to counsel despite the high stakes for those involved one can only imagine how dramatically this caseload will increase after the enactment of a new immigrationreform law within the executive office for immigration review there is a board of immigration appeals where decisions of immigration courts may be reviewed and policy set at the discretion of the attorney general the due process clause of the constitution applies to all persons including aliens in considerable measure because immigration judges are not independent and there are inherent conflicts of interest federal circuit courts of appeal are flooded with requests for review of immigration cases despite legislation passed more than 15 years ago granting it immigration judges have no contempt authority because the justice department has refused to allow them to use it this appears to come from an aversion to allowing immigration judges who are justice department attorneys to discipline department of homeland security attorneys who prosecute immigration cases subpoenas issued by immigration judges go unenforced when directed at homeland security attorneys because us attorneys wont pick sides between the two sibling agencies it is not unusual for immigration judges to face personal discipline when making goodfaith legal decisions because the justice department responds to complaints from disgruntled parties the appropriate recourse would be an appeal the basis of most complaints against immigration judges relate to their decisions not to allegations of conflict of interest or personal gain by the judge these judges can also be subjected to personal discipline for not meeting the administrative priorities of their supervisors in the justice department and may be placed in the position of having to choose between risking their jobs and exercising independent decisionmaking authority the only effective way to address these problems is to reorganize immigration courts under article i of the constitution to give them independence from justice or any other agency article i judges are not subject to article iii protections such as lifetime tenure and against salary reduction but they are independent judges the united states tax court the bankruptcy courts and the us court of federal claims are all article i courts it was the recommendation of the 1981 select commission on immigration reform to reorganize immigration courts under article i it was formulated into legislation hr 185 which i introduced in the us house in 1999 the nature and volume of immigration cases dictate that there be a trial division and an appellate division under article i the appellate division would do what the current administrative appellate board does and perhaps more if congress desires all judges would be appointed by the president subject to senate confirmation or alternatively only the appellate division judges would be presidential appointees with the chief judge of the appellate division appointing trial judges tenure should be for a certain number of years perhaps 15 among proponents of an article i court there are differing views over which higher courts should have jurisdiction to entertain review of decisions of article i immigration courts and with which restrictions limiting review to the court of appeals for the federal circuit by writ of certiorari or by application for a writ of habeas corpus would be the most efficient and take into account the benefit of only that court having to tackle complex immigration matters details such as appellate review can be debated and resolved by congress the important thing is that the creation of an article i immigration court should be included in any immigrationreform legislation passed by congress only then will we see our immigration laws effectively and fairly administered and adjudicated bill mccollum is a partner in dentons public policy and regulation practice and a former attorney general of florida loaddate june 17 2013 language english

228 of 997 documents the forward may 3 2013 asylum provisions at risk after boston terror attack section news pg 1 length 1590 words jewish activists are worried that shock waves from the boston marathon terrorist attack could delay congressional action on a longsought immigration reform package and endanger a provision on asylum the hebrew immigrant aid society has been urging lawmakers to include a provision in the reform legislation that would extend filing deadlines for immigrants seeking political asylum in the united states but the groups task may be complicated by the emergence of two ethnic chechen brothers as terrorist suspects who were first admitted into the country as part of a family of political asylum seekers of course hias is worried that immigration restrictionists have already started to exploit the boston tragedy in a manipulative effort to thwart immigration as well as asylum reform said mark hetfield president and ceo of hias the leading jewish advocacy group the boston terror attacks will have a very substantial bearing on the issue for immigrants hetfield countered that among the 11 million undocumented immigrants are refugees who missed the asylum filing deadline and that comprehensive immigration reform would bring them out of the shadows and make america more secure currently visitors who arrive here and decide to seek asylum as political refugees must apply for this status within 12 months hias argues that individuals fleeing persecution should be allowed a longer period of time to file for asylum before being deported to the countries from which they fled it is a small detail in a massive set of rules and procedures offered in the reform but dealing with any asylum issue in the postboston environment has become somewhat more difficult the tsarnaev brothers suspected of carrying out the april 15 attacks entered america on an asylum visa after their parents convinced authorities that as muslim chechens they would face persecution from the russian authorities critics including kentucky republican senator rand paul have tied the tsarnaevs entry into the united states as asylum seekers to the broader question of immigration reform why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the united states from the chechen republic in russia an area known as a hotbed of islamic extremism who then committed acts of terrorism paul asked in an april 22 senate hearing pauls question rests on assumptions that are arguably inaccurate or lacking in context tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev were granted asylum as young children in 2002 based on the governments approval of their parents request there has been no indication that their parents the asylum applicants harbored any extremist sympathies nevertheless the discussion has raised questions about the asylum process it might make a difference politically because of peoples kneejerk reaction said hetfield but he argued that the boston attack could in fact highlight the need for reform that would close immigration loopholes and ensure background checks for all security and immigration reform are not mutually exclusive he said in fact you cant have security without immigration reform still the effort by immigration reform opponents to shift attention to security aspects of the issue could resonate with the jewish community it is a community known on the one hand for its strong support for welcoming immigrants but on the other hand for its sensitivity to security concerns especially when related to islamic extremism im more skeptical of immigration reform now than i was six or seven months ago said william kristol editor of the weekly standard in an interview with fox news he suggested that before we move ahead with 880 pages of immigration reform a closer look should be given to security lapses such as those revealed in dealing with the tsarnaev brothers hetfield making the case for easing asylum procedures noted that the brothers did not abuse the asylum system he stressed that asylum seekers undergo strict background checks before being allowed to stay in the united states proimmigration advocates in the jewish community believe that these questions and similar concerns over entry of extremists to the united states will not weaken jewish determination to see immigration laws fixed were a smart community and we all understand it will make everyone more secure said deborah lauter director of civil rights at the antidefamation league an april 22 hearing at the senate judiciary committee over a proposed comprehensive immigration bill made clear that the boston attack and its aftermath now loom large over the discussion a heated debate erupted as chuck schumer a jewish new york senator who is among the authors of the bill accused republicans of pointing to the boston attack as an excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it for many months the statement led to a harsh response from iowa republican chuck grassley who had said earlier that immigration reforms should be carried out carefully in light of the boston terror attack the fact is that this issue will now be present in the debate but it is hard to say if it will change the structure of the legislation said audrey singer an immigration expert at the brookings institution she noted that following the november 2012 elections focus shifted away from security aspects of immigration and toward the potential economic benefi ts of overhauling a system that has failed to deal with americas immigration needs boston she said shifted back the focus and allowed those who have this point of view to be more vocal the bill compiled by a bipartisan group of senators known as the gang of eight requires beefing up border security to meet specific criteria of preventing illegal crossing followed by establishing a path to citizenship for an estimated 12 million undocumented workers currently living in the united states it also provides more legal opportunities for highskill and lowskill workers to come to america following the gops defeat in the 2012 elections which was attributed in part to the loss of the latino electorate republicans have moved towards support for immigration reform but still not all in the party accept the notion of a path to legalization for undocumented workers proimmigration advocates expressed optimism regarding the chances of reform legislation passing in the senate but a house version has yet to be introduced and the battle there could be tougher the white house has indicated that it would like to see the reform approved this summer for the jewish community immigration reform has always been an easy sell driven by a collective memory of earlier generations reaching americas shores at the turn of the 20th century the organized jewish community has for years maintained a strong sentiment favoring welcoming immigration policy for the current debate jewish groups formed the we were strangers too coalition comprising national jewish organizations as well as local groups and synagogue denominations while all members of the coalition support the call for reform some are pushing for specific amendments and provisions reflecting their jewish interests and values hias has asked lawmakers to permanently designate iranian religious minorities including jews as eligible for refugee resettlement in the united states thus easing their processing overseas currently there are an estimated 700 iranian jews waiting to immigrate to america the reform movement would like to see the bill improve family reunifi cation procedures to include siblings adult children and spouses of all genders and bend the arc a progressive jewish organization is advocating equal rights for samesex couples undergoing immigration procedures public opinion polls show strong support among rankandfile members of the jewish community for a more open immigration policy although this sentiment is not as strong among older and republican jews a 2009 poll however also showed significant concern among american jews over inadequate enforcement of immigration laws critics of immigration reform feel that the boston events could potentially chip away at jewish support for the move by making the connection between a lenient immigration policy and an increase in the threat of terrorism the boston terror attacks will have a very substantial bearing on the issue and will increase public apprehension toward amnesty said stephen steinlight senior policy analyst at the center for immigration studies a think tank opposed to immigration reform steinlight who formerly served as the american jewish committees director of national affairs argued that the boston marathon attack made people understand how inept the federal government is at screening for terrorists this should be a serious concern for the jewish community he said it is critical that america remains a safe place for jews hetfield reached an opposite conclusion he believes that only a process of legalization for those already in the country illegally will put an end to an existent underground made up of millions of immigrants who fear any contact with authorities such a process he said would help the government in identifying extreme elements who have entered or might seek to enter america loaddate

229 of 997 documents the business times singapore april 30 2013 tuesday the gops immigration bill dilemma rejecting bill will draw hispanic voter backlash but partys antiimmigration activists are against approving the plan byline leon hadar washington correspondent section editorial opinion length 1095 words during the presidential election campaign in 2008 the expectation in washington was that whoever would be elected as president either democrat barack obama or republican john mccain the next white house occupant would be working together with a bipartisan congress to launch an historic reform of us immigration policy after all at that time there seemed not to be lot of ideological differences between the democratic and republican presidential candidates and their political allies in capitol hill when it came to the need to come up with solutions to the problem of illegal immigration this issue has dominated political debates for the last two decades it has been estimated that there are between 10 million to 20 million illegal immigrants from mexico and latin america residing in the united states surpassing the number of legal immigrants these people have constituted a huge population flow that has placed enormous pressure on the healthcare and educational systems in many states not to mention the major challenge to the legal system and the police the interesting thing was that until 2008 it was the mr mccain who represents arizona a state with a large hispanic population and growing number of illegal immigrants and not the mr obama who was playing a leading role in congress in pressing for major changes in the immigration policy this included his efforts to craft with the late liberal democratic senator ted kennedy a law that would have provided many of the millions of the illegal hispanic immigrants a path to getting an american citizenship but starting in 2009 something happened to senator mccain and the entire republican party on the road to immigration reform the gop came under the influence of the populist and nationalist wing of the party represented by the tea party movement tea partiers advocated more restrictive policies on immigration and opposed mr mccains plan to allow illegal immigrants to become citizens which they denounced as an amnesty to those who violated the law by entering and staying illegally in the us the antiimmigration sentiment became popular not only in the republican party but also among many americans hit by the financial crisis and rising unemployment produced by the great recession and who feared that illegal and legal immigrants were stealing their jobs so it was not surprising that opposition to immigration reform and in particular to the amnesty plan became a central tenet of the gop agenda with mr mccain and other moderate republican politicians recognising that they would not be able to win the support of the partys activists especially during election primaries without denouncing even modest efforts towards immigration reform the result was that the republicans in congress including mr mccain had emerged during the first term of mr obama as the main obstacle to any proposal that could have been perceived as an amnesty to the illegals indeed with the exception of former utah governor jon huntsman all the republican presidential candidates in 2012 including the nominee former massachusetts governor mitt romney rejected all the plans for providing a path of citizenship for illegal immigrants including mr obamas proposal to grant citizenship to children of illegal immigrants who were born and raised in the us but then starting in 2013 something happened to the republicans on the road to opposing immigration reform that something was the huge electoral loss of hispanic votes that the republicans suffered during the 2012 presidential and congressional elections indeed concluding that the growing electoral power of hispanic voters could determine the outcome of elections in key states in the coming years including in traditionally red ones such as nevada colorado and perhaps even in texas and recognising that their agenda on immigration has been responsible for antagonising voters the republicans decided that they needed to change and to exhibit a more accommodating position on immigration reform with mr mccain and cubanamerican senator marco rubio from florida leading the way the republicans on capitol hill made it clear that they were ready to make a deal with the white house and the democrats on a comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would include a timetable for granting citizenship for illegal immigrants in addition to the consideration of electoral politics playing into the hands of the immigration reformers in the gop has been the improving economy that has started to change antiimmigration public attitudes in fact according to gallup opinion polls around 70 per cent of americans now support a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants who politicians and journalists are referring now to as undocumented immigrants new reality in addition the high rate of unemployment in the us has made the country less attractive to potential immigrants from mexico that new reality together with stricter border security has brought about a decline in the number of mexicans crossing into the us and has helped make the problem of illegal immigration more manageable the endresult is that a group of democratic and republican senators including mr mccain and mr rubio and dubbed by the press as the gang of eight is developing a long 844 pages and complex immigration reform bill that is bound to anger many of the antiamnesty republican activists and lawmakers since its expected to propose a 13year period for processing citizenship for illegal immigrants who would be required among other things to pay penalties and back taxes go through a rigorous criminal and security checkup and pass a citizenship test but while proimmigration and hispanic activists exude a sense of optimism these days about the chances that a bipartisan immigration reform bill would be approved during mr obamas second term they concede that its not a sure thing yet that two immigrants from the caucasus were behind the recent terrorism atrocity in boston has already led a few wavering lawmakers to express some scepticism about the idea of relaxing immigration rules but what would probably determine whether an immigration bill would finally get approved by congress would be the electoral calculations of the republicans or to put it in more simple terms would the republicans be more worried about a potential backlash from hispanic voters if they reject the immigration plan or from the partys antiimmigration activists if they approve the plan loaddate april 29 2013 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2013 singapore press holdings limited

reform the supreme court rejected an appeal from alabama and let stand a finding that the states statute was preempted by federal law byline warren richey staff writer section usa length 1064 words the us supreme court turned aside an appeal on monday from the state of alabama asking the high court to examine whether state governments can pass laws making it illegal to harbor or smuggle illegal immigrants within a states borders the court action came without comment from the justices the order noted that justice antonin scalia dissented from the courts decision not to hear the case the denial comes as congress and the white house are working toward an immigration reform package at issue in alabama v us 12884 was an alabama statute that sought to echo the requirements of federal immigration laws that outlaw similar activities it was patterned on a controversial immigration law passed in arizona in 2010 aimed at discouraging illegal immigrants from coming to or remaining in arizona while alabama argued that its statute was substantively different from those portions of arizonas law previously struck down by the supreme court the justices refusal to take the case lets stand an appellate court ruling that the alabama law was preempted by federal immigration law eight other states have similar laws that seek to regulate activities related to the presence of illegal immigrants within state borders they were adopted in an attempt to compensate for what state officials viewed as lax or ineffective enforcement of us immigration laws by the federal government like it did regarding arizonas sb 1070 the obama administration opposed the alabama law and successfully sued the state in federal court to prevent it from enforcing any statute that might touch on issues involving illegal immigrants that posture toward the states set the stage for a constitutional confrontation pitting the authority of the national government to set immigration enforcement priorities against the power of the states to protect state residents within their own borders the obama administrations crackdown against aggressive state immigration laws also dovetailed with a political strategy in the presidents reelection campaign candidate obama used the statefederal disputes and the promise of a kinder gentler immigration posture by his administration to appeal to latino voters it worked in november the president received 71 percent of the latino vote last june the supreme court invalidated three sections of arizonas sb 1070 saying they were preempted by federal immigration law but the justices also upheld the laws controversial centerpiece the showmeyourpapers provision that ordered police to check the immigration status of anyone they had reason to suspect were in the us without authorization the question in the alabama case was whether alabamas antiharboring statute is preempted by federal immigration laws and the more forgiving immigration enforcement priorities of the obama administration in general laws passed by congress are the supreme law of the land and thus preempt state laws that either intrude into an area of federal power or conflict with an existing federal statute the portion of the alabama law that was being appealed involved state prohibitions on harboring inducing the arrival or transporting illegal immigrants in alabama these provisions are markedly different from the ones this court invalidated in the arizona case alabama solicitor general john neiman wrote in his brief to the court mr neiman said that rather than attempting to regulate the actions of the illegal immigrants themselves an area of federal authority the alabama statute sought to regulate state residents engaged in unlawful activity that was related to illegal immigrants that distinction neiman said differentiated the antiharboring law from the portions of the arizona statute struck down last year by the supreme court the united states makes no attempt to justify equating laws that operate directly on aliens with those that operate on citizens the alabama solicitor general wrote us solicitor general donald verrilli urged the court to not take up the alabama case he said the eleventh us circuit court of appeals ruled correctly when it decided that the alabama law was preempted by federal immigration law mr verrilli quoted the supreme courts decision in the arizona case the government of the united states has broad undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens he wrote whatever power a state may have related to immigration is subordinate to supreme national law washington has wide discretion in every area touching on immigration and immigration enforcement he said the federal governments exclusive authority to regulate the terms and conditions of an aliens entry movement and residence in the united states includes the authority to establish criminal sanctions against third parties who facilitate an aliens violation of those terms and conditions and the authority to decide whether and how such criminal sanctions may be imposed the solicitor general said because congress has occupied this entire field even complimentary state regulation is impermissible verrilli wrote he said the alabama statute stands as an obstacle to the operation of federal law congress provided that state and local law enforcement officials have the authority to arrest individuals for violations of federal immigration law but it is up to federal officials to decide when or whether to prosecute those who are arrested according to the governments brief arizona and eight other states had asked the high court to take up alabamas appeal they are colorado florida georgia indiana kansas michigan oklahoma and south carolina the states friend of the court brief said the eleventh circuit went too far when it ruled that a state law with any connection to immigration is preempted unless specifically authorized by congress no interest is more fundamental or substantial than the states interests in protecting their residents from harm the friend of the court brief said some criminal organizations profit by providing the means for illegal entry or transport or a safe harbor within the united states for unauthorized aliens the brief said other organized crime groups and terrorists exploit immigrants who seek to come to or remain in the united states by forcing the immigrants to commit other crimes such as drug running or prostitution loaddate april 30 2013 language english

231 of 997 documents chicago daily herald april 28 2013 sunday a change of perception section reflejos pg 18 length 917 words ap the national mood on immigration has changed dramatically since arizona approved a firstofitskind immigration law igniting a furor over border security and the countrys treatment of immigrants a mere three years later president barack obama and republicans and democrats in congress are lobbying for the nations first immigration overhaul in nearly three decades and public opinion is on their side the remarkable and almost shocking shift has renewed debate in arizona and other states opposed to mass immigration about whether its time to double down or back off arizonas law drew international complaints of unlawful police scrutiny and inspired a handful of copycat policies across the country the centerpiece of the measure requires police to question suspects about their immigration status a provision that would be vastly undermined if millions of immigrants are able to obtain legal status arizona was is and will always be concerned primarily about border security said state rep john kavanagh one of the republican architects behind the bill no matter how much they wish they are not going to get the american people to turn their back on border security and the rule of law kris kobach kansas secretary of state and the author of arizonas immigration law also remains an avid defender of selfdeportation policies as the best defense against illegal immigration arizona has proved if you ratchet up the penalties people comply kobach said monday during a senate hearing on immigration the proposed immigration overhaul would allow tens of thousands of new high and low skilled workers into the country and extend legal rights for some 11 million immigrants already here it also seeks to strengthen border security and includes stiff penalties for illegal immigration signs that arizonas legacy of tough enforcement lives on but the rhetoric against illegal immigration has become much more polite since 2010 when the fervor was at a climax and arizona passed senate bill 1070 then a national campaign to end birthright citizenship warned of asian and hispanic mothers darting across borders to empty their wombs on us soil candidates ran for the us house with tv spots featuring menacing mexicans there was talk of kidnappings gangs drug cartels and desert beheadings these days both of arizonas republican us senators are among those leading the immigration overhaul effort the arizona state lawmaker who created the landmark immigration law was forced out by voters and the proposal advancing in congress would grant legal status to most immigrants illegally in the country we are looking at a major shift in public opinion said tony payan of the james a baker iii institute for public policy at rice university in texas it took us all by storm republicans and democrats alike say the turning point was the november elections when hispanic and asian voters overwhelmingly swept obama into a second term after years of antiimmigrant rhetoric from the gop and just months after the obama administration announced an unprecedented policy allowing young immigrants to seek legal status while republican president george w bush won more than 40 percent of the latino vote in 2004 romney received 27 percent hispanic support less than any presidential candidate in 16 years if we pass this bill i dont think we gain a single hispanic vote immediately said arizona sen john mccain when unveiling the national immigration legislation last week what it does is it puts us on a level playing field to compete for those votes america has a long history of suspicion toward immigrants said mark hugo lopez associate director for the pew hispanic center in washington dc nearly two decades ago most americans considered immigrants a burden on the country in march only 41 percent of americans said they still felt that way lopez said young liberal voters are shaping public opinion but so are hispanics who comprised 163 of the population in 2010 up from 125 percent in 2000 in all more than 40 million hispanic will be eligible to vote in 2030 according to pew data a steady decline in illegal immigration since 2006 and a gradual economic recovery that put the national unemployment rate at a fouryear low in march have also influenced changes in the immigration debate people are really tired of the issue and they want it to go away said audrey singer a senior fellow specializing in immigration policy at the brookings institution in washington dc the recognition that it is better to know who is living in our country and to bring them out of the shadows so that all workers benefit seems to resonate with people in recent months state lawmakers across the country have debated extending rights to immigrants living in the country illegally including greater access to higher education and drivers licenses democratic state sen steve gallardo has worked for years to overturn arizonas immigration law but he has largely been ignored by the republicanled legislature the conversation in washington is a sign that the state law has a dim future gallardo said this is what america wants he said of comprehensive immigration reform but public sentiment on immigration could easily turn again with a change in

232 of 997 documents the christian science monitor april 25 2013 thursday senate house pursue sharply different paths to immigration reform senates bill is sweeping and its moving fast the house so far is taking up immigration reform piecemeal and is proceeding at a well deliberative pace why are the approaches are so different byline david grant staff writer section usa length 1120 words two key house republicans plan to push ahead on immigration reform by focusing on a few specific bills keeping the issue before the chamber widely expected to have the hardest time with immigration reform legislation even as the senates sweeping bipartisan bill speeds toward the finish line whatever their differences in style and substance though immigration players in both senate and house expressed confidence thursday of approving some kind of reform before the year is out we do have a broken immigration system and the house does intend to play a leading role in making sure this is solved said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte r of virginia whose panel oversees immigration law mr goodlatte and rep trey gowdy r of south carolina who chairs the house subcommittee charged specifically with immigration policy are starting with smaller pieces of the immigration puzzle rather than one overarching bill they say their committees members will introduce two standalone measures one on foreign agricultural workers and one to make mandatory an employee verification system known as everify as a first stab at immigration reform that dripdripdrip approach contrasts markedly with action in the senate where two leaders on immigration reform on thursday offered the hope that their sweeping measure could win significant bipartisan support sens charles schumer d of new york and john mccain r of arizona argued that it is very possible majorities of senators in both parties could support a comprehensive immigration reform solution leading to a final tally of ayes north of 70 in that chamber a bipartisan gang of eight senators unveiled a comprehensive reform bill last week and it has already had three hearings before the senate judiciary committee sen pat leahy d of vermont the panels chairman started the bill toward the senate floor on thursday by scheduling time to amend it in early may when congress returns from a district work week senate majority leader harry reid d of nevada says the bill could hit the senate floor for further debate and amendment in june at a breakfast with reporters sponsored by the christian science monitor senators mccain and schumer said they had taken care to anticipate the needs of their gop colleagues stripping from the bill a diversity visa program that conservatives dislike and ensuring that interests of southern farmers are accommodated if we were to pass this bill with say over 50 democratic votes but only eight or nine republican votes it would pass we would get to 60 but it would bode poorly for the reform effort in the house schumer said the bills supporters want a bold bipartisan senate vote that will jolt the house which has been pursuing a more deliberative tack on immigration reform the houses goslow approach is intended to help educate members from districts with tiny minority populations who have never handled immigration issues as well as to fulfill the promises of republican house leaders that more bills will follow the standard legislative process by which more lawmakers have opportunities to contribute the houses path has its critics of course who predict that the reform effort will be foiled if it is diverted from a comprehensive track rep goodlatte knows full well theres a broad bipartisan bill that is likely to pass the senate and a broad bipartisan bill that is about to be introduced in the house rather than truly supporting these measures he is introducing partisan piecemeal measures that went nowhere in the last congress said frank sharry executive director of americas voice in a statement on thursday goodlattes announcement makes it easier for opponents of broad reform to oppose comprehensive reform while claiming they support something mr sharry continued goodlatte repeatedly emphasized on thursday that his committee is open to an eventual product from the houses bipartisan immigration negotiating group the senates eventual product or somewhere else and he underlines the goal is not to kill the immigration reform effort were certainly not doing that goodlatte says we have been working very hard on this and we respect the effort of others but we encourage all of them to be careful examine the legislation very closely understand how each component of immigration relates to every other component so we dont get the law of unintended consequences taking hold in this matter so why go ahead with small pieces of reform knowing that doing so raises the ire of immigration reformers goodlatte says more than 100 house republicans have attended gop education sessions on immigration but that represents less than half the gop conference by introducing pieces of the immigration puzzle one at a time goodlatte and mr gowdy believe they can drill down on the specifics of each portion of the immigration system so that their members understand the stakes and potential solutions of each one the immigration education sessions have been as wellattended as the information sessions hosted by house budget committee chairman paul ryan during the debt ceiling fight of 2011 but some members are on the sidelines gowdy saysintroducing specific bills goodlatte says will underscore the house majoritys seriousness about taking on immigration reform and will encourage more members to become engaged our function in moving legislation into the committee so we can look at it and hold legislative hearings on it is that doing so will be a wakeup call to those who havent done it to say hey you better come down and start looking seriously at what were doing on immigration he says in other words the house whose bipartisan immigration reform group has yet to produce a bill needs to keep moving and it must keep moving keep educating keep the debate flowing because of members like representative gowdy gowdy a former prosecutor elected during the tea party wave of 2010 who has a flair for giving booming emotional speeches on the house floor noted that hispanics make up less than 2 percent of the citizens in his district in the palmetto state as such his own constituents are not exactly pushing for him to take up immigration reform but gowdy says they might appreciate a policy fix that actually solves americas longrunning immigration problem this is not a political exercise to me says gowdy which is why i appreciate so much the approach the chairman goodlatte is taking i would like a remedy that sustains us for the remainder of my lifetime so im much more interested in a process that is confidenceinspiring than a political remedy loaddate april 27 2013 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2013 christian science publishing society

julia preston contributed reporting section section a column 0 national desk pg 13 length 1039 words washington a senior republican senator said friday that the approaching political debate about an immigration overhaul should take into account the revelation that the suspects in the boston marathon bombing had apparently emigrated to the united states from kyrgyzstan senator charles e grassley of iowa the most senior republican on the senate judiciary committee opened a hearing on immigration legislation by stressing the issues importance particularly in light of all thats happening in massachusetts right now and over the last week given the events of this week its important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system mr grassley said in his opening statement while we dont yet know the immigration status of people who have terrorized the communities in massachusetts when we find out it will help shed light on the weaknesses of our system fridays hearing was expected to offer an early glimpse into how the senate would react to immigration legislation that a bipartisan group of senators introduced this week instead it was overshadowed by developments in the boston bombing case which also affected the meeting directly when the homeland security secretary janet napolitano who was scheduled to testify before the committee on border security and enforcement had to cancel her appearance to oversee her departments involvement in the investigation according to homeland security officials one suspect dzhokhar a tsarnaev 19 who was captured friday night arrived in the united states in 2002 and remained as part of an asylum claim by his father his brother tamerlan tsarnaev 26 who was killed friday arrived in that period but applied for asylum around 2005how can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil mr grassley asked how can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the us senator charles e schumer democrat of new york and a member of the bipartisan group behind the legislation urged caution about linking the bombings to flaws in the countrys immigration system before i get to the bill id like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation mr schumer said in general we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who was here has their fingerprints photos etc has conducted background checks and no longer needs to look at needles through haystacks referring to the legal immigration program that the brothers most likely used mr schumer added both the refugee program and the asylum program have been significantly strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people and determining who should and should not be coming into the country the hearing formally kicked off consideration of a plan that would increase border security and would quickly legalize many of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the united states eventually offering them a path to full citizenship opponents of the plan and conservative pundits have already cited the boston bombings as a reason to move slowly but mr grassley received a rebuke from both sides of the aisle senators lindsey graham of south carolina and john mccain of arizona both republicans and members of the bipartisan group released a statement friday afternoon urging their colleagues and the public not to link the boston bombings with an overhaul of the nations immigration laws some have already suggested that the circumstances of this terrible tragedy are justification for delaying or stopping entirely the effort for comprehensive immigration reform the joint statement read in fact the opposite is true immigration reform will strengthen our nations security by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left a basic function of government that our broken immigration system is incapable of accomplishing today senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont and chairman of the judiciary committee similarly said he did not think the boston bombings should affect the legislation if we change the policies of this country every time something happens whether its oklahoma city 911 this then were never going to do anything he said after the hearing the connection between the boston attacks and the immigration debate is still tenuous if early reports that the suspects came into the country legally prove correct that could undermine attempts by opponents to link the bombings to political concerns about the immigration overhaul still backers of the 844page legislation who include president obama were already facing a delicate task in trying to pass it in the next six weeks to succeed they need to navigate issues of economic fairness border security deportation and charges that the bill would inspire a new wave of illegal immigration the boston bombing not only injects a new issue into that debate but also potentially robs the president and lawmakers of some of the momentum to overhaul the nations immigration laws proponents of the legislation quickly rejected mr grassleys assertions saying that no connections should be made between the boston attacks and the immigration overhaul until more information was known there are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played if any in what happened said alex conant a spokesman for senator marco rubio republican of florida a chief sponsor of the immigration bill regardless of the circumstances in boston immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security frank sharry the executive director of americas voice a group backing an immigration overhaul criticized mr grassley for bringing the boston attacks into the

241 of 997 documents the christian science monitor february 27 2013 wednesday detainees released could that hurt immigration reform video hundreds of immigration detainees deemed low risk have been released part of a national game of chicken over the sequester but the move could have consequences for immigration reform byline patrik jonsson staff writer section usa length 1221 words citing impending budget cuts immigration officials have announced the release of hundreds of detainees considered lowlevel threats to public safety this move by us immigration and customs enforcement ice has quickly turned into one of the most baffling chapters in the publicrelations chess match going on between house republicans and the obama white house over the looming sequester the release of detainees may score some shortterm points for president obama who has been sending dire warnings about the impact of the cuts including with a speech tuesday at a virginia shipyard but the gop could also strike a chord with americans by highlighting security concerns and other issues posed by the release and such concerns could bring into play even more than the fight over federal spending deficits and the debt namely the release of detainees could also affect the debate over comprehensive immigration reform thats important because the gops political future may in part be staked on potential gains that the party can make with hispanic voters mr obama too could lose a lot if immigration reform falters its natural that people in a federal organization are going to take this chance to prove how important they are to the public especially as that goal is aligned with a white house trying to raise the ante over the spending cuts says allert browngort an immigration expert at the university of notre dame in indiana but he adds this also points to some of the questions around the immigration bill right now including how serious the government is about securing the usmexico border according to the department of homeland security the release came as ice prepared for the sequester which is set to kick in friday and which mandates automatic cuts from nearly all corners of the federal bureaucracy including ices 205 billion budget in announcing the release ice insisted that the government is not dropping these deportation cases the agency released these lowrisk noncriminal detainees under a less expensive form of monitoring to ensure detention levels stayed within ices overall budget white house spokesman jay carney said wednesday insisting that the white house was not involved in the decision on monday dhs secretary janet napolitano a member of the obama cabinet offered im supposed to have 34000 beds for detainees how do i pay for those we want to maintain some 22000 border patrol agents ive got to be able to pay their salaries currently 30000 immigration scofflaws are housed in 250 detention facilities nationwide proimmigrant activists hailed ices move calling it a commonsense approach that will save the government a lot of money they also cited research suggesting that those enrolled in alternativetodetention programs which include gps anklets come to their final immigration hearings 96 percent of the time more broadly however 59 percent of all alleged immigration lawbreakers who are not detained by ice fail to show up for their immigration court dates critics say moreover some 600000 illegal immigrants have never answered deportation letters sent to them by ice according to the center for immigration studies cis a washington think tank that advocates stronger borders and tougher immigration enforcement illegal immigrants are by definition flight risks says steven camarota research director at the center so far polls suggest that republicans are on a death march by opposing moves like eliminating tax loopholes and some deductions mr browngort says earlier this week louisiana gov bobby jindal r complained that obama is trying to scare the american people by ginning up potential effects from the sequester which really puts the brakes on spending growth in part by reducing treasury outlays for discretionary spending beyond the sequester showdown are the recent moves toward immigration reform with both obama and a bipartisan group of senators notably including sen marco rubio r of florida outlining proposals that move illegal immigrants toward legalization in that light the obama administration could be particularly vulnerable to criticism over releasing lawbreakers especially if any of those detainees cause mayhem that makes the news the obama administration is basically saying look the republicans are so irresponsible theyre forcing us to release illegal aliens says mr camarota at cis but im not sure this particular gambit is going to play out the way they hope obviously theres nothing in the sequester that says you have to release anybody and if you have legalization thats predicated on a promise of future enforcement and this shows the obama administration is not serious about enforcing laws rep robert goodlatte r of virginia whos been tasked with trying to find a compromise path for immigration reform in the house addressed ices move at a wednesday breakfast with reporters sponsored by the monitor if the presidents idea of how to manage our federal government is to release thousands of people who have been detained and most of the people who have been detained are not just illegally present in the united states but theyve committed some kind of a criminal act in addition to that that seems to me to be a pretty misguided approach to how you save money in that agency representative goodlatte said according to the new york times several highranking republicans shrugged off the release as part of an ongoing number of administration scare tactics designed to undermine those republicans who dont mind seeing the automatic cuts go into effect the situation is a peek into the gops internecine warfare where especially tea party hardliners on spending and immigration are at loggerheads with establishment republicans pushing for immigration reform and a sequester deal that may include a tax hike one of the things youve got right now is that the gop establishment understands that theyve got to get something done on immigration which is why theyre taking a relatively lowkey approach to the detainee releases browngort says they dont want the base riled up on this right now they need them to be quiet it may be too late in arizona pinal county sheriff paul babeu said on npr wednesday morning you dont have to be a detective to figure out that likely this is a weapon in the sequestration fight he added a lot of criminal illegals were released onto streets and neighborhoods in my county and thats not ok house speaker john boehner obamas chief adversary in the sequester debate couldnt hold back either this is very hard for me to believe that they cant find cuts elsewhere in their agency mr boehner said on cbs tuesday im looking for more facts but i cant believe that they cant find the kind of savings they need out of that department short of letting criminals go free also on tuesday the senior dhs official in charge of arresting and deporting illegal immigrants informed his staff of his retirement the associated press reported gary mead will be leaving at the end of april according to an email to his staff that was obtained by ap he apparently told senior dhs leaders several weeks ago of his plans loaddate february

section section a column 0 national desk pg 19 length 826 words washington president obamas nonconfrontational tone on an immigration overhaul in his state of the union address on tuesday night probably did more to advance the issue lawmakers said than if had he offered a fierce rallying cry as he did about gun restrictions as senators gathered wednesday for the first hearing on the proposed sweeping changes in immigration law they said the presidents decision to give members of both parties room to maneuver on the delicate politics of immigration was a strategic choice that could pay off as negotiations continued hes walking a tightrope here trying to allow congress on a bipartisan basis to come up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the senate said senator richard j durbin of illinois the no 2 senate democrat he encouraged us told us he doesnt want this to drag on forever and if we cant get it done hell play more forceful role mr durbin a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators working on an immigration bill added the reason hes on this tightrope is the republicans dont want to make it appear that they are bending to the president on this issue influential republicans praised mr obama as well representative paul d ryan of wisconsin the partys vicepresidential nominee last year said the presidents tone on immigration was measured and constructive i thought on immigration he used the right words and the right tone which tells me he actually doesnt want to politicize this which is conducive to getting something done mr ryan said given their losses in the congressional elections in november republicans in both the house and senate have demonstrated a new openness to immigration changes that could lead to legal residency for millions who have entered the country illegally at the same time polls have shown that the presidents involvement in the debate decreases republican support white house officials said the president was just as aggressive on immigration as he was on firearms though his appeal for changes in gun laws was one of the emotional peaks of the night cecilia muñoz director of the white house domestic policy council said immigration was an issue on which we expect an outcome and we expect it soon the president who most recently laid out his own immigration principles in a january speech in las vegas told congress on tuesday night that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform it was a refrain he repeated several times to applause mr obama proceeded to highlight what he believed are the three goals of any immigration deal ensuring that the borders are secure creating a meaningful path to citizenship and overhauling the system to deal with legal immigration but when talking about immigration he seemed to lack the emotional resonance not to mention the forceful call to action that he exhibited when discussing gun control where he exhorted the country to remember that all victims of gun violence deserve a vote which may have been exactly the point senator charles e schumer democrat of new york began his remarks at wednesdays hearing by thanking the president for his state of the union comments on immigration his remarks last night on immigration were just right mr schumer said he importuned us to act he stated how important it was to get this done for the future of america but at the same time he did not make it a wedge issue he made it clear that we had to act in a bipartisan way and gave us in our little group the space to come up with a bipartisan proposal which we know is really our only hope senator jeff flake republican of arizona and a member of the bipartisan group said he had no complaints actually i thought it was good for the process if he were to be seen as leading the effort it likely wouldnt be that helpful mr flake said but to say that hell sign the bill we put on his desk thats helpful the hearing focused largely on border security and enforcement with an entire panel devoted to just one witness secretary janet napolitano of the department of homeland security ms napolitano said that border security was often used as an excuse to prevent meaningful changes but in a glimpse of the debate to come ms napolitano met resistance from key republicans including senator charles e grassley republican of iowa the committees ranking member and senator john cornyn republican of texas over enforcement i do not believe that the border is secure mr cornyn said and i still believe we have a long long way to go the four democratic senators in the bipartisan group senators michael bennet of colorado and robert menendez of new jersey as well as mr durbin and mr schumer were to meet with mr obama at the white house on

and told the crowd not to get soft on him i hope the topic of immigration isnt going away and everybody doesnt surrender arpaio told the crowd former state senate president russell pearce also spoke lambasting the federal government and noting a few of his accomplishments opposing illegal immigration but no other speaker broached the topic after his speech pearce said the subject of illegal immigration is not going away in arizona even if its no longer a hot topic with his fellow republicans especially those in leadership at the state capitol pearce said the bills the legislature has passed worked noting that many illegal immigrants have selfdeported or left arizona that violent crime is down and that there are fewer illegal immigrant children in the public education system you dont need a lot more bills you need enforcement he said weve done our job at the legislature i think there are some tweaks to be done but we won back at the arizona capitol things arent what they were

leaders who are focused on job creation and improving the state budget in pearces day deporting illegal immigrants was considered a way to create jobs and bolster the budget senate bill 1070 in 2010 was the pinnacle of the antiimmigration movement in arizona  its passage marked the moment when immigration hawks told the federal government they werent going to wait for it to take on the problem that arizona would handle its immigration problems alone if necessary but less than a year after the bill was signed into law the wave of anti immigration rhetoric in arizona subsided on march 17 2011 pearce and his supporters put five antiimmigration bills up for a vote by the full senate even with pearce shepherding the bills through and with a republican supermajority in both chambers the bills failed handily later that year pearce lost a historic recall election in his district by wide margins sending a chilling signal to toughonimmigration lawmakers smith still fighting the only republican legislator still keeping up the fight at the state capitol the only one who has introduced any antiimmigration legislation this session is rep steve smith  he reintroduced two of those five failed

hoping the bills will gain the support of the majority of his caucus this year or at least get a hearing his hb2293 which would require hospitals to contact law enforcement if they cannot verify the citizenship of a patient was assigned to the house health committee but has not yet been scheduled for a hearing house bill 2289 which would require schools to collect data on students who are enrolled in school and cannot prove lawful residence in the united states has not been assigned to a committee he also introduced hb2283 which would reduce requirements for state agencies to publish information in languages other than english allowing them to post spanish versions of documents only online and maintain a spanish copy at their office that bill is scheduled for a hearing in the house government committee the bills all aim to either quantify or minimize the costs of illegal immigration to the state he said if lawmakers honestly care about budgets about spending problems about taxpayer money then these bills will help address all those issues he said unlike pearce smith doesnt think the legislatures work is finished when it comes to border and immigration issues when we had multiple immigration bills introduced in the senate in 2011 you had some republicans stand up and say lets give it a rest so maybe some people have sb 1070 fatigue i dont know he said but i know that was years ago and the last time i checked 1070 did not solve all our border and immigration problems he said he has softened his legislation over the years and he hopes lawmakers who had immigration fatigue last year have rested and are ready to continue the fight but most of smiths colleagues who came into office in 2008 and 2010 on promises of solving the illegal immigration problems are more muted on the topic now melvin enforcement needed sen al melvin rsaddle brooke sponsored four of the five immigration bills that died in the senate in 2011 melvin and smith rmaricopa both represent district 11 after redistricting forced the two into the same district and led smith to move to the house to avoid a primary battle but this year melvin has signed on to only one borderrelated bill he is the prime sponsor of a measure to continue the office of sonora set up to facilitate communications and the exchange of information among companies individuals private organizations and governmental agencies of sonora mexico and arizona melvin said he will support smiths bills if they arrive in the senate and he rattled off a list of problems the state still faces involving illegal immigration but melvin said he wasnt sponsoring any antiillegal immigration legislation because there are other big issues that need to be dealt with and passing a bill like sb1070 every year doesnt make sense we need to enforce the laws that are on the books he said democrats push agenda meanwhile democrats are trying to put a different set of laws on the books and have pushed their own immigration agenda though its still likely to go nowhere in the republicandominated legislature this year far more democratic bills have been filed on immigration than republican bills and although they usually cant get their legislation passed democrats are hopeful  they say the tone the conversation and the momentum have shifted at the state capitol assistant house minority leader ruben gallego dphoenix said democrats have taken the offensive on immigration even though they cant accomplish what they would like back in the day there were a couple of us who were screaming lonely in the woods and the tide was on the side of the russell pearces and the arpaios of the world now clearly the tide has changed he said noting that pearce has been recalled and arpaio narrowly won his most recent election gallego said that nationally republicans have seen the writing on the wall that latinos are becoming an increasingly large portion of the population and are increasingly turning away from the gop and that even at the capitol republicans are moderating their stances on immigration gallego said pearce and melvin didnt believe the laws on the books were sufficient when they were pushing the failed measures of 2011 and he pointed to pearce as a major factor in president barack obamas wide margin among latinos over republican mitt romney when people were out talking to the latino community they would talk about the arizona bills and how russell pearce and mitt romney had the same views on immigration gallego said i know because i did it the national approach in many ways what is happening in arizona politics now mirrors what is happening at the federal level following his victory in which three out of four latinos chose him as their leader obama has again put immigration near the top of his agenda and arizonas two republican us senators jeff flake and john mccain are leading the national conversation on immigration reform with their recentlyannounced bipartisan proposal that would offer illegal immigrants a path to citizenship democratic us rep raul grijalva of southern arizona stood on the capitol lawn shortly after the proposal was announced offering rare praise of arizonas republican us senators and the plan he said arizonas strong stance against illegal immigration galvanized people on both sides of the debate and has provided an impetus for the shift toward comprehensive federal immigration reform i think its been a doubleedged sword one side to try to get something passed at the national level so states wouldnt do what was done here and its also galvanized the enforcementonly people to not look at the other aspects of immigration grijalva said while pearce said his side won the immigration debate in arizona immigrant rights groups say he only won a battle with sb1070 that the war is still going and the momentum is on their side raquel teran statewide director of mi familia vota said the state capitol isnt the hotbed of antiimmigrant rhetoric it was a few years ago she noted a lot of that has to do with efforts to register more latinos to vote latino involvement in the elections increased from 16 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2012  her group alone registered more than 15000 new voters in that timeframe as well as adding 48000 voters to the permanent early voter list she said immigrant rights groups are raising a new class of politically savvy latino citizens through their efforts to educate and involve young latinos adios arpaio a political action committee that focused on registering new voters in their failed attempt to oust the sheriff was staffed mostly by high school volunteers our community has become part of the decisionmaking process were learning about the decisionmaking process

250 of 997 documents the hill january 17 2013 thursday rep paul ryan maneuvers for position on immigration reform byline by daniel strauss section pg 3 length 912 words rep paul ryan rwis is jockeying for position on immigration reform ryan the 2012 republican vice presidential nominee and budget guru of the gop has kept a low profile since the november elections but ryan has quietly been discussing comprehensive immigration reform with rep luis gutierrez dill one of the most outspoken proponents of changing the nations immigration laws the wisconsin republican has also huddled with sen marco rubio rfla a potential 2016 white house rival who is seen as the gops leading voice on the issue ryan this week endorsed rubios plan ¯ a clear sign that he is not planning to be on the sidelines during the 2013 debate university of oregon political science professor daniel tichenor stated its a safe bet that rubio will be at center stage on immigration reform in coming months and ryan does not want to be outflanked or to surrender the spotlight so easily aides close to ryan and gutierrez say the budget committee chairman intends to continue to be involved in immigration reform talks as congress moves closer to passing a comprehensive bill ryans participation in the early negotiations began in december when while at the gym he recommended to gutierrez that the illinois congressman reach out to rep raul labrador ridaho according to gutierrez and congressional aides labrador is a tea party favorite who is pushing his party to embrace immigration reform rubio held a wideranging discussion with ryan last month on the likely major bills of the 113th congress that conversation according to a ryan aide included immigration they both had a frank conversation as peers and decided the time was now to work and move the aide said there are no plans for ryan to meet with gutierrez anytime soon but the two house members plan to keep talking according to staffers for the two congressmen the answer is yes they plan to keep talking according to one of the aides gutierrez recently left the house financial services committee to work on immigration reform as a member of the relevant judiciary subcommittee ryan is quick to cite his support for a comprehensive immigration reform bill sponsored by gutierrez and thenrep jeff flake rariz in 2005 which authorizes nonimmigrant status to undocumented aliens in the us if they pay a fine and meet certain criteria it is apparent that ryan is seeking to put some distance between his position and that of his 2012 running mate mitt romney during the gop primary romney veered to the right and advocated selfdeportation of illegal immigrants that position was mocked by both democrats and republicans ive had a pretty consistent record on the issue ryan said in a brief interview on tuesday indeed the house budget committee chairman has been involved in a number of bipartisan immigration reform bills in 2008 and 2009 but he has also attracted criticism from immigration reform activists in 2005 he voted for a bordersecurity bill sponsored by rep james sensenbrenner jr rwis that advocates lambasted ryan also voted against the dream act which democratic leaders brought to the house floor at the end of 2010 regardless there is no daylight between ryan and rubio on immigration sen rubio is exactly right on the need to fix our broken immigration system ryan wrote on his facebook page on monday i support the principles hes outlined modernization of our immigration laws stronger security to curb illegal immigration and respect for the rule of law in addressing the complex challenge of the undocumented population backing from ryan is a valuable asset for any immigration reform plan because the eightterm lawmaker is popular within the house republican conference and with the gop base gutierrez said ryan is capable of bringing a lot of republican votes hes going to be critical and essential gutierrez told the hill on wednesday gutierrez who has not been shy in criticizing president obamas broken promises on immigration during his first term stressed that ryans involvement doesnt pose a threat to rubio university of dayton political scientist jamie longazel who specializes in immigration law and politics isnt shocked that ryan is weighing in i think because hes in a leadership position its not surprising to see him taking the lead as the republican party tries to change his image on immigration longazel said immigration at its core is about money its about economics ryans website says he does not support amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants already living in the united states but in backing rubios proposal ryan supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants albeit a more conservative one than democrats favor while ryan is eager to make a quick defense of his immigration record hes coy about discussing progress on the latest negotiations when asked when his next meetings with other legislators would happen ryan would only say youll see immigration experts read ryans engagement as a sign that republicans are paying more attention to latinos they finally appreciate that the gop cannot be a viable national party with a competitive future without changing how latino and asian voters perceive their brand tichenor said and his potential involvement on immigration reform not only broadens his policy portfolio but also sets him up as one of the leaders who pushed the republican party to broaden its tent loaddate october 9 2013 language

laws sources gop pledge to america subjects immigration states gop pledgeometer compromise as the state of arizona wrangled with the justice department in 2010 about its authority to help enforce federal immigration laws the new house republican majority sided with arizonas governor the republicans said they would reaffirm the authority of state and local law enforcement to assist in the enforcement of all federal immigration laws that was before the us supreme court invalidated most parts of the law in june 2012 house lawmakers took action some of their most recent moves in march 2012 they held hearings on hr 3808 the scott gardner act which would have empowered state and local law enforcement pulling over drunk drivers to check immigration status and hold in custody unlawfully present aliens the measure didnt make it to the house floor in may 2012 they amended an appropriations bill to try to stop the federal challenge to arizonas law it prohibited funding for the attorney general to challenge state immigration enforcement laws not just in arizona but also in oklahoma missouri utah indiana alabama south carolina and georgia the bill died in the senate in june 2012 they amended a different appropriations bill this time to protect a program that deputizes some state and local law enforcement officers to help with immigration enforcement it prohibited funding from being used to terminate the program known as 287g that bill also died in the senate while those efforts to reaffirm the authority of state and local law enforcement failed congress continues to fund some programs that enlist state and local help they come in two forms in the first type some state and local officials are deputized to enforce federal immigration laws thats the case with the controversial 287g partnerships between us immigration and customs enforcement and local agencies critics argue they encourage racial profiling and discourage immigrants from reporting crime congress funded them through continuing appropriations said chris rickerd of the american civil liberties union though the obama administration is winding down the most contentious task force partnerships then there are programs that enlist state and local help arguably without ceding any real authority those include the secure communities program under which fingerprints taken by local jurisdictions are shared with federal officials to be checked against immigration databases operation stonegarden a grant program to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for work along border areas and the state criminal alien assistance program which reimburses some local corrections systems for detaining people who are in the country illegally those are examples of congressional support for local and state law enforcement assistance said jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies which advocates for low levels of immigration but rickerd of the american civil liberties union which opposed the arizona law and 287g argues that since decisions about enforcement remain with federal agencies the programs dont necessarily reaffirm any authority on the part of local officials house republicans in the 112th congress promised to reaffirm the authority of state and local law enforcement to assist in the enforcement of all federal immigration laws lawmakers made a series of attempts to do that but efforts stalled or were rebuffed by the senate still congress did reauthorize funding for several programs that enlist state and local participation in federal

253 of 997 documents the washington post january 7 2013 monday regional edition beyond secure borders byline doris meissner section editorial copy pg a13 length 892 words illegal immigration and enforcement have been the dominant concerns driving immigration policy for more than 25 years deep public skepticism over the federal governments will and ability to enforce the nations immigration laws has come with them as a result enforcement first a proposition that argued for effective enforcement as a precondition to broader reforms became widely embraced in a report released monday the migration policy institute documents how dramatically facts have changed from those longheld perceptions particularly since sept 11 2001 but dating to the 1986 immigration reform and control act irca which attempted to end illegal immigration through employer sanctions increased border enforcement and legalization the nation has made unprecedented steep investments in the capacity of federal agencies to aggressively enforce immigration laws since the 1986 legislation was enacted nearly 187 billion has been spent on immigration enforcement budgets for the two main federal enforcement agencies us customs and border protection cbp and us immigration and customs enforcement ice and its primary enforcement technology initiative the us visitor and immigrant status indicator technology usvisit program are nearly 15 times what was spent to operate the us immigration and naturalization service in 1986 today the federal government spends more on its immigration enforcement agencies than on all its other principal criminal law enforcement agencies combined spending for customs and border protection immigration and customs enforcement and usvisit reached nearly 18 billion in fiscal 2012 contrast that with the 144 billion spent for the fbi drug enforcement administration secret service us marshals service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives such spending which reflects a strong proenforcement consensus in congress has built a muscular complex crossagency system it extends beyond us borders to screen visitors against multiple intelligence and law enforcement databases before they arrive in the united states it also reaches into communities across the country through information sharing interoperable databases and partnerships with state and local law enforcement the system that has emerged is generating record levels of enforcement results l customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement refer more cases for federal prosecution than all the justice department law enforcement agencies combined including the fbi dea and atf l a significantly larger number of individuals are detained each year in the immigration detention system just under 430000 in fiscal 2011 than are serving sentences in federal bureau of prisons facilities for all other federal crimes l more than 4 million noncitizens primarily unauthorized immigrants have been deported from the united states since 1990 with removals rising from 30039 in fiscal 1990 to a record 409849 in fiscal 2012 l imperatives for border control have led to record highs in border patrol staffing technology and infrastructure at the same time apprehensions have fallen to 40year lows 340252 in 2011 down from more than 16 million in fiscal 2000 after the 1986 reforms growth of the resident unauthorized population resumed and increased to levels of about 525000 annually but that began to change in 2007 and there has been a negative flow since the shift primarily stems from reduced job demand in a recession economy and changing conditions in mexico but it also reflects the buildup of enforcement capacities together they have led to a fundamental reset in the calculus of illegal migration the nation has built a formidable immigration enforcement machinery judging by resource levels case volumes and enforcement actions immigration enforcement ranks as the federal governments highest criminal law enforcement priority enforcement first has become the nations de facto response to illegal immigration changes to the immigration system have focused almost entirely on building enforcement programs and improving their performance gaps in enforcement such as employer accountability remain to be addressed but building an everlarger enforcement bulwark is hard to justify in an era of fiscal restraint and one in which illegal immigration has abated because of factors that include strengthened enforcement and immense resource infusions even with recordsetting expenditures and the full use of a wide array of statutory and administrative tools enforcement alone no matter how well administered is an insufficient answer to the broad challenges that illegal and legal immigration pose for americas future changes must also be made to better align immigration policy with the nations economic and labor market requirements and with future growth and wellbeing the enforcement machinery that has been built can serve the national interest well if it also provides a platform for policy changes suited to the

immigrants in fiscal year 2012 a new record it emphasizes deporting criminal aliens to protect public safety but the high figure serves to remind latinos of the presidents unfilled pledge to reform immigration policy byline david grant staff writer section usa length 831 words the united states deported more than 400000 illegal immigrants in 2012 the most of any year in the nations history us immigration and customs enforcement ice reports the record number released friday is also important for another reason it is a stinging reminder to latinos that president obama failed during his first term to pursue the comprehensive immigration reform that they seek the obama administration framed its 2012 work in immigration enforcement as focused mainly on criminals 55 percent of deportations came from convicted criminals a record high rather than on indiscriminately rounding up illegal immigrants and sending them home ice on friday also issued new detention guidelines intended to emphasize legal action against those who have committed crimes above and beyond immigration violations while the fiscal year 2012 removals indicate that we continue to make progress in focusing resources on criminal and priority aliens we are constantly looking for ways to ensure that we are doing everything we can to utilize our resources in a way that maximizes public safety ice director john morton said in a statement in four years the obama administration has deported threequarters of the number of people that president george w bushs administration did in eight and unlike mr bush obama made no concerted effort to reform the us immigration system a history thats not lost on the presidents latino supporters this is nothing to be proud of said rep luis gutierrez d of illinois a leading lawmaker on immigration reform for a decade in a statement on the deportation statistics while representative gutierrez lauded the crackdown on criminals as necessary he said some 90000 undocumented parents of americanborn children continue to be deported each year we must also realize that among these hundreds of thousands of deportations are parents and breadwinners and heads of american families that are assets to american communities and have committed no crimes the gutierrez statement said solving this problem in a humane and sensible way requires congress to act on immigration reform and do what we have been unable to do for 25 or 30 years the closest the obama administration came to reshaping immigration policy was the summer 2012 implementation of the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program whereby some young unauthorized immigrants could gain a twoyear deferral of deportation and access to work permits and drivers licenses some 355000 people have applied under the program and just over 100000 have been approved through middecember according to the latest data from us citizenship and immigration services as many as 17 million undocumented immigrants could be eligible for the program over time experts say while immigration advocates cheered the presidents daca order they also remember his unfulfilled promise at the start of his term in 2009 to take on immigration reform as well as the record number of deportations under his watch the credibility of the president is on the line says ali noorani executive director of the national immigration forum the president has to lead the president has to show republicans and democrats that hes serious about this and that hes not just going to use it as a political lightning rod obama has promised to tackle immigration reform early in 2013 and congressional discussions about potential legislation are under way between lawmakers from both parties in the house and senate if obama doesnt republicans will be eager to point out that democrats once again broke their promises to some of the lefts key voting blocs i just want to remind all of you though that the democrats had two years to do something about immigration reform said rep raul labrador r of idaho after a vote on a gopled bill that would havewould have didnt that pass killed the diversity visa lottery in favor of more visas for highly educated immigrants in the stem science technology engineering and math fields they had a white house they had the house they had the senate and they did nothing about immigration reform he said and that could make latino and asian voters who sided overwhelmingly with democrats in the 2012 election susceptible to republican overtures in the future everybody talks about the incredible turnout of the new american vote in 2012 but latinos asians and other voters are not diehard democrats mr noorani says theres a lot of space there for republicans to step into until obama and reformminded members of congress make good on their vows that 2013 will yield a comprehensive fix to americas immigration system however latino asian and other proimmigration forces will continue to

258 of 997 documents deseret morning news salt lake city november 13 2012 tuesday evangelical coalition sees opportunity for immigration reform byline matthew brown deseret news length 939 words washington dc a broad coalition of evangelical leaders seeing a political opportunity to address immigration on the federal level on tuesday renewed its call for president obama and congress to begin tackling the historically divisive issue within the first three months of next year letters from the evangelical immigration table have been sent to obama and house and senate leadership requesting meetings between the lawmakers and the groups leaders and urging them to introduce legislation within the first 92 days of obamas second term the timeline is in reference to the number of times ger the hebrew word for stranger or immigrant appears in the bible the time frame also underscores the approach religious organizations take on immigration which isnt always political for us its not most about politics its most about bible teaching and relationships said leith anderson president of the national association of evangelicals and one of the principals of the coalition which is comprised of liberal conservative and latino leaders of the national evangelical community the bible teaches how people should treat their neighbors and newcomers to the land he said and evangelicals interact with immigrants at church in schools and in the immigrants native countries where missionaries have worked for generations the evangelical immigration tables announcement follows calls from other business and political groups since last weeks election for the president and congress to reach a bipartisan solution to immigration the letters are the evangelical groups second attempt this year to put immigration on congress radar since election day however a political window has opened that influenced the trio of letters the evangelical immigration table sent out tuesday last week house speaker john boehner rohio urged obama to take the lead in coming up with a plan that would look at both improved enforcement of immigration law and the future of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally over the weekend democrat chuck schumer of new york and republican lindsey graham of south carolina also disclosed they have resumed talks on immigration policy that broke off two years ago and have put together an immigration reform blueprint that has the real potential for bipartisan support based on the theory that most americans are for legal immigration but very much against illegal immigration anderson said those comments show the political momentum is moving toward immigration reform we have a unique moment right now to achieve this goal and we plan to move forward with it added barrett duke vice president for public policy and research at the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention in their letters the evangelical immigration table asks that the bipartisan solution respect the godgiven dignity of every person protect the unity of the immediate family respect the rule of law guarantee secure national borders ensure fairness to taxpayers and establish a path toward legal status or citizenship immigration policy has been largely ignored since president george w bushs proposal for reform died in 2007 immigration was seldom a topic mentioned from the pulpit during church services leading up to the 2012 election surveys by the pew research center showed abortion and samesex marriage were more often preached to churchgoers from the minority of pastors who chose to speak about politics but the issue has resurfaced as a way for republicans to rebound from their election performance in which more than 70 percent of hispanic voters supported obama who has committed to addressing comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 hispanic evangelicals make up 10 percent of the electorate and in the coming years that number will grow said rev gabriel salguero president of the national latino evangelical coalition this election season split our country but today we come together in an unprecedented show of unity within the evangelical community black white hispanic and asian the evangelical immigration table first unveiled its immigration reform plan to congress in june and urged them to address the issue the during the election year the table represents about 150 evangelical organizations across the country that includes thousands of churches and millions of protestant churchgoers the roman catholic church and the church of jesus christ of latterday saints mormon have also signed on and supported local efforts for comprehensive and compassionate immigration reform state lawmakers including utahs legislature have also moved ahead during the past five years with their own immigration initiatives some of which have been challenged in federal court for overstepping into federal jurisdiction business labor and local governments are also organizing to push for immigration reform these coalitions of strange bedfellows in faith business and government should give the president and congress the political will to reach a bipartisan solution to immigration said jeremy robbins director of the partnership for a new american economy a bipartisan coalition of 500 mayors and business leaders making a case for immigration reform the reality is there are a lot of extremely persuasive reasons for immigration reform and different ones resonate with different groups robbins said the evangelical vote is a huge portion of the electorate so the letters from the evangelical immigration table should have huge influence on the push for reform loaddate november 14 2012 language

260 of 997 documents pittsburgh postgazette october 21 2012 sunday two star edition whos killing the american dream ready for a reasonable discussion on us immigration pilar marrero forcefully makes the case of openborder advocates but undermines her case for dialogue byline john f rohe section arts entertainment book review pg b5 length 804 words b killing the american dream how antiimmigration extremists are destroying the nation b by pilar marrero palgrave macmillan 27 in 1987 one of pilar marreros first assignments as a journalist focused on the 1986 immigration and control act this statute was intended to amnesty 3 million illegal immigrants while preventing future illegal immigration as she notes only the first objective was met illegal immigration persisted and proliferated over the intervening decades with an eye on the past ms marrero discusses the benefits of illegal immigration in killing the american dream she finds it fills jobs americans wont do and it lowers the price for consumer goods she considers enforcement efforts against illegal immigration to be not only counterproductive but futile because willing and desperate employees will always beat an inexorable path to willing and costcutting employers while identifying ineffective strategies in the nations struggle with illegal immigration the author mentions the socalled section 287g collaborations between local and federal law enforcement californias and arizonas propositions denying public benefits to illegal immigrants president bill clintons enforcement efforts post911 laws president obamas deportations local enforcement strategies as in hazleton pa alabamas recent statutes and the supreme court ruling on arizonas immigration laws ms marrero an editor and reporter for the spanishlanguage daily la opinion finds immigration to be an extremely controversial topic and the system is dysfunctional she laments that since the mid1990s it has been impossible to have a reasonable discussion on the issue the highly volatile complex issue offers few rewards to any politicians who decide to address it as comprehensively and honestly as it merits she expresses hope for the nation to someday engage in a detailed analysis killing the american dream however offers no criteria by which a national policy might determine the optimum level of immigration in light of jobs the environment resources or the means to provide public assistance on a planet experiencing a daily net population gain of 331000 births minus deaths essentially another pittsburgh daily the need to foster a detailed analysis on the optimum level of immigration is destined to rise in prominence the author seems content to allow this national policy to be determined by prevailing migration patterns she discredits any attempt to address the level of immigration as hateful to this extent the book seemingly undermines the authors aspiration for a reasonable discussion the national policy in establishing a nondiscriminatory sustainable level of immigration will be enhanced by dignified communications and mutual respect not everyone at the table is filled with hate the author offers no insight why for example 47 percent of hispanics supported arizonas prop 200 denying public benefits to illegal immigrants in cnns exit poll she fails to explain why during clintons administration the barbara jordan immigration commission called for an end to illegal immigration and for substantially reduced levels of legal immigration she offers no insight on why an april 2012 poll by dallasbased pulse opinion research revealed only 10 percent of us voters approve the current rate of population growth which according to the us census bureau will double us population from 313 million as of april to more than 600 million by the end of the century she makes no attempt to explain why recent immigrants minorities underprivileged and others would have concerns over the nations anticipated 40 percent population increase in less than 40 years is there too little congestion too much unfilled landfill space are jobs too plentiful wages too high is water in the parched south too abundant access to credible projections and worrisome trends often outpaces our ability to responsibly process the information the human act of data gathering and prediction is not always a common enterprise this book becomes a case study on how these variables can nurture a bias the aspiration to convene a reasonable discussion might begin by formulating a criteria for the level of immigration in a nation which as the author observes continues to welcome more legal immigrants than any other country in the world imputing detestable motives to anyone weighing into the conversation will not advance a reasonable discussion killing the american dream capably lays out the claims of open border advocates if however you seek substantive information on ethical criteria in formulating a longrange

273 of 997 documents the christian science monitor june 25 2012 monday arizona did supreme court take the steam out of states immigration activism a majority of americans want to see their states adopt immigration laws similar to arizonas but the supreme courts decision monday may give state legislators more wiggle room to avoid the subject byline patrik jonsson staff writer length 990 words while the us supreme court on monday struck down major pieces of arizonas controversial immigration law as state overreach its far from clear whether the ruling will quash legislative efforts in other states to ferret out illegal immigrants in their populations the political backlash over state immigration laws and the natural ebbing of illegal migration resulting from the poor economy were two reasons the number of immigrationrelated bills at the state level declined by 44 percent between 2011 and 2012 but a big part of that equation was also the supreme courts pondering of arizonas sb 1070 as states awaited an inkling of where the nations top judges stood on the topic the decision on monday was in parts decisive chiding arizona at one point for introducing intrusions on the federal scheme but it left intact the arizona laws papers please provision that allows police officers to ask for identification from people they suspect to be in the country illegally that caveat leaves enough of an opening for state legislators to keep weighing the majority support among americans for tough immigrationrelated laws against such laws political and economic risks short term this decision keeps immigration as a frontandcenter issue in the 2012 election because it didnt provide closure and essentially told both sides to go at it says peter brown assistant director of the quinnipiac university polling institute in the long term what it means is that state legislatures at least in some states will likely have to deal with this in terms of whether they get an arizonastyle law that includes the parts that got the seal of approval the supreme court did draw some definitive lines for states pondering arizonastyle laws making it a state crime for an illegal immigrant to seek work and walk around without immigration papers for example is not allowed also not allowed is giving police authority to arrest people for immigration related crimes federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep track of aliens within the nations borders justice anthony kennedy wrote in the 5to3 majority opinion justice kennedy noted specifically that if the court allowed arizona to arrest people for not carrying papers attesting to their legal residency status every state could give itself independent authority to prosecute federal registration violations on the papers please aspect the court in effect said it needs to be tested after implementation since the justices could not gauge its legal implications without seeing it at play the arizona law allows police officers in the process of enforcing other laws to check the immigration status of people they reasonably believe to be in the country illegally a key part of the broader symbolism of state immigration laws intended to push illegal immigrants to move elsewhere that spectre of racial profiling is a critical one as attitudes around immigration are looming larger in the presidential election across the us about 56 percent of americans want to see their states adopt an arizonastyle law according to quinnipiac but among hispanics in battleground states the spectre of the supreme court upholding the papers please provision showed that 60 percent of latino voters thought it would create an antiimmigrant and antihispanic environment with 28 percent of latinos saying the law would have no effect on attitudes according to a recent latino decisions poll in tennessee polls regularly show at least 70 percent of voters backing tougher immigration laws and joe carr a republican lawmaker from murfreesboro has acquiesced sponsoring several key antiillegal immigrant bills that have passed the tennessee legislature with bipartisan majorities dissatisfaction with washingtons ability to control immigration remains a driving force in the states politics he says although he concedes lawmakers dont have much more work to do on the immigration front now that the supreme court decision has come down we will be taking a hard look at what other additional measures we can take that the court has allowed to move forward mr carr says some immigration experts say its likely that the steady growth in immigration related state bills since 2005 is over punctuated by mondays supreme court decision in the first quarter of 2012 legislators introduced 865 immigrationrelated bills and resolutions compared with 1538 in the same period in 2011 according to the national conference of state legislatures arizona lawmakers introduced 33 immigrationrelated bills this year compared with 57 last year i think at this point weve literally exhausted every state or municipality willing to pass these kinds of laws says jamie longazel a sociologist who studies immigrationrelated issues at the university of dayton one telling fact the supreme court in a case out of arizona last year confirmed the ability of states to demand that employers use the federal everify immigration database to check the status of new employees in the year since no states even states like alabama and georgia which passed sb 1070style laws in the interim have actually walked through the door the supreme court opened to mandate such checks meanwhile backlash from not just hispanic activists but also from teachers religious leaders business people and farmers have made immigrationrelated legislation more difficult and politically risky to pass policy experts say its really possible that were seeing an important turning point says tamara jacoby president of immigrationworks usa which advocates immigration reform on behalf of small businesses i think a lot of people in the states have been waiting for a way to save them from having to pass tougher immigration laws and i think the supreme court decision helps them loaddate june 25 2012 language english publicationtype newspaper copyright 2012 christian science
