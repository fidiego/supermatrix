Krauthammer: Should we trust pope or man behind broken ObamaCare promise?
 Charles Krauthammer said Thursday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that people can either believe President Obama’s version of what happened at his meeting with Pope Francis, or they can choose a different option offered by the Vatican.While President Obama said he avoided discussing “social schisms” during his meeting with Pope Francis, the Vatican’s official readout said discussion turned to “the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection, as well as the issue of immigration reform.”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“On the one hand, you’ve got the bishop of Rome, the Holy See, of whom a billion co-religionists believe in his infallibility,” Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, said. “On the other hand, you’ve got the man who said, 'If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.’”Krauthammer said it is possible there is a way to “square the circle” between the two versions.“The Vatican made clear it was including the conversation with the pope and the one (President Obama had) with the secretary of state, whereas Obama tried to make it very narrow, just a conversation with the pope,” he said. “So if you wanted to say they’re both right, you’d say the emphasis on Obama’s conversation with the secretary of state was on the religious issues.”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics
