Immigrants, supporters rally across the US for Obama to halt immigrations
PHOENIX –  Dozens of immigration advocates and supporters are rallying in cities across the country in a renewed effort to push President Barack Obama to put a freeze on deportations.Organizers of Saturday's "Day of Action" demonstrations say Obama has the executive power to stop deportations that separate immigrants living in the country illegally from their loved ones.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn Eloy, Ariz., numerous supporters have converged in front of a federal detention center after journeying more than 60 miles from Phoenix.Organizers say many of those present have relatives who have been inside the facility for more than a year.In March, Obama asked Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review enforcement practices to ease his administration's rate of deportations.Under Obama's leadership, almost 2 million people have been removed from the U.S.
