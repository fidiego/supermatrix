Former NYC Mayor Bloomberg Group Rolls Out Ads Pushing Immigration Reform
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg may be out of office, but at least one project he actively participated in is still going strong.A group he backs, the Partnership for a New American Economy, is rolling out an ad campaign to push Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year.The commercials are to appear in inside taxicabs in the nation’s capital, , according to USA Today, with the objective that constituents and members of Congress will see them and be motivated to act on a reform measure.“Immigrants invented many of the things we use every day,” a female narrator says. “Without them, America wouldn’t be America.”The ads mention businesses begun by immigrants, among them Levi Strauss of blue jeans fame, who came from Germany and Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is from Russia.Bloomberg’s organization also includes News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO and president.The commercials also will run online and on television.USA Today quoted John Feinblatt, the group’s chairman, as saying the “lack of action on immigration reform is causing American industries to lose their competitive edge.”Last June the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure that, among other things, tightened border security, expanded foreign worker visas and provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But the effort has stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority and several of them have vowed not to pass a bill that gives amnesty to people who have broken immigration laws.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino
