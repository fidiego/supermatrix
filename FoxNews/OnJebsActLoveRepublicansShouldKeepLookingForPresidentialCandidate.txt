On Jebâs 'Act Of Love': Republicans Should Keep Looking For A Presidential Candidate
Call it the Jeb Bush, establishment-Republican variation on âthey are just looking for a better lifeâ clichÃ©. And letâs just call him âJeb.âIn what should be the last words of a viable presidential campaign probe, Jeb defends the victims of borders who illegally enter the remnants of the Republic and take American jobs with the unforgettable words "yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love, it's an act of commitment to your family.â- D.A. KingIs Jeb saying that anyone in the world with a commitment to their family should be allowed to live and work in the U.S. as long as they don't plan on felonious activity?  If so, it could get very crowded. We already take in more than a million legal job-seekers every year.Not many Americans should have much trouble closing their eyes and imagining Jebâs mindless, pandering proclamations coming out of the mouth of any screaming SEIU street protestor carrying a ânot one more deportationâ placard.If not a careful explanation of why Marco Rubio took a painful â and likely permanent â nosedive in the presidential polls, somebody may want to forward the current unemployment numbers to the Bush compound. And maybe send along the United States Code regarding identity fraud and theft of Social Security numbers. Or the fact that coming back to the USA after deportation is a felony.Jeb floated his âso be itâ ramblings while at least 20 million Americans who are committed to their families are out of work or underemployed. The day after Jebâs remarks, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a bill to again extend unemployment payments for Americans who have been out of work for at least six months.Apparently American families â of all descriptions â are not a priority for Jeb when it comes to the politics of dutifully providing the business bosses with âcheapâ labor.Call it an exploratory expedition. In publicly supporting the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty/immigration expansion scam that will never see the presidentâs desk and putting forth his Chuck Schumer-esqe âitâs an act of loveâ notion, Jeb set out to gauge the progress of the tireless propaganda work of the amnesty-again coalition. Somebody had to venture out to see if Big Business, Big Religion, âBig Razaâ, many in Big Media, the Democrats and the Republican establishment bosses have convinced the GOPâs conservative base that it is time for another amnesty. âDo you believe us yet?â they wonder, âthis time, we are really going to secure the borders. But later. Trust us.âIt was big of Jeb to allude to âthe rule of lawâ in his remarks. And to the possibility that the 40 percent or so of the illegal aliens present in the U.S. who are visa overstayers may be âpolitelyâ asked to leave. What next, a Jeb suggestion that the âsecure the homelandâ laws put in place after 9/11 requiring biometric monitoring of temporary visa holderâs departures actually be funded and politely enforced?Many Americans who love their families suspect that if there were any real intent to secure American borders and enforce our immigration laws, it would have begun on September 12, 2001.Using information recently released by DHS, Jessica Vaughan at the Center for Immigration Studies notes âICE released 68,000 criminal aliens in 2013, or 35 percent of the criminal aliens encountered by officers. The vast majority of these releases occurred because of the Obama administrationâs prosecutorial discretion policies.ââThe preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed. Even those with criminal convictions are being released. DHS is a department in crisisâ says Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama.One can only imagine a Jeb-run immigration enforcement apparatus.Somebody tell Jeb: According to news reports, in an annual report released this month, "One Nation Underemployed: Jobs Rebuild America," the National Urban League noted that the underemployment rate for African-American workers was 20.5 percent, 18.4 percent for Hispanic workers and 11.8 percent for white workers."Many Americans are being left behind, and that includes African-Americans and Latinos who are being disproportionately left behind by the job creation that we see," National Urban League President Marc Morial said. We wonât hear it from the âparty-of-the-working manâ Democrats, but another amnesty and doubling immigration is not the solution to this shameful crisis.Neither is Jeb.Republicans with a commitment to inclusion and victory should keep looking for a presidential candidate. As an act of love.D.A. King is president of the Georgia-based Dustin Inman Society, which works to control immigration . He is not a member of any political party.
