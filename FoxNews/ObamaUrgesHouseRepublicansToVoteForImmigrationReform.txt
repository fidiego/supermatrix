Obama urges House Republicans to vote for immigration reform
President Barack Obama marked Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the introduction of the bipartisan immigration reform approved last June by the Senate by calling on Republicans in the House of Representatives "to listen to the will of the American people" and bring the measure to a vote."The Senate's commonsense agreement would grow the economy by $1.4 trillion and shrink the deficit by nearly $850 billion over the next two decades, while providing a tough but fair pathway to earned citizenship to bring 11 million undocumented individuals out of the shadows," the president said in a statement."Simply put, it would boost our economy, strengthen our security, and live up to our most closely-held values as a society," Obama said of the Senate legislation.While House Republicans, who refuse to allow the bill to be voted upon "have repeatedly failed to take action, seemingly preferring the status quo of a broken immigration system over meaningful reform," the president said."Instead of advancing commonsense reform and working to fix our immigration system, House Republicans have voted in favor of extreme measures like a punitive amendment to strip protections from 'Dreamers,'" Obama said, referring to GOP attempts to undo his administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.He went on to cite "broad support for reform, including among Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and faith and law enforcement leaders."
