132 Haitian migrants intercepted in Bahamas
Authorities intercepted 132 undocumented Haitian migrants during a routine patrol near Ragged Island, the Bahamian government said Tuesday.The group includes 22 women and six children.The migrants were apprehended aboard a sloop with the assistance of local fishermen, police said.None of the Haitians managed to reach the shore of Ragged Island, according to the Bahamas' director of Immigration, William Pratt."The whole boat was apprehended. And from what I was told, they all appear to be in good health, but when they get in Nassau the medical team will examine them," he said.Authorities are still trying to determine exactly where and when the migrants began their journey.Pratt said the immigrants were being transported to a detention center on New Providence island.That facility, according to officials, is already holding 202 migrants, including 126 Haitians.Immigration officers picked up around 90 Haitian immigrants in Exuma last week during a special operation, Pratt said, adding that both the Exuma and the Ragged Island contingents will likely be repatriated to Haiti by the end of this week."We don't want the detention center to get overcrowded," he said.
