Texas Democrat Calls GOP Attacks On Migrants Insulting
Austin –  State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, the Democrat who is trying to become the first woman and first Hispanic to serve as lieutenant governor of Texas, sees the rhetoric Republicans use to attack clandestine immigration as insulting."It's disheartening to hear the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor use such a harsh rhetoric," she said here in an interview with Efe, referring to comments by the two men vying for the GOP nomination.Incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst faces state Sen. Dan Patrick in a May 27 runoff to decide who will oppose Van de Putte in the November election.Patrick describes clandestine immigration as "invasion" and has made disparaging comments about the region along the Mexican border."The real fact of the matter is that there is zero net migration and that we trade $720 million a day with Mexico," Van de Putte said.Close to 65 percent of the U.S.-Mexican border is in Texas, whose population is 38 percent Hispanic.Van De Putte acknowledges the importance of prosecuting human and drug trafficking, but says the federal government added 8,000 Border Patrol agents in recent years, built 700 miles of border fence and deported tens of thousands of the undocumented who have no criminal records."When Republican candidates refer to a very vibrant area of our state as a third world and as a war zone, people of these communities are insulted. And I am insulted because I am Texan," the San Antonio resident said.Van De Putte expressed disappointment at Washington's inability to pass immigration reform."It's very difficult when the primary goal of the Republicans is to win the next election rather than do what is right," she said. "But I also know that if we had a president and the Congress working together, we can solve this and come to middle ground".In Texas, where many voters look with distrust at federal authorities and only 34 percent approve the administration of President Barack Obama, Democrats make few references to the White House in their political rallies."I am not running for U.S. Congress, I am running for lieutenant governor in the state of Texas," Van de Putte says about the matter.The Democratic candidate for governor of Texas is Wendy Davis and, though these are two separate elections, the leadership of two women for the first time in the history of the state is symbolic.In the primaries, however, Davis got fairly poor support in some Latino-majority counties in south Texas, which her Hispanic colleague attributes to confusion and their unfamiliarity with the candidate."When they get to know her, they will see how great a leader she can be," Van de Putte said.A pharmacist by training, the 59-year-old Van de Putte has been married for 36 years and has six children and six grandchildren.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino
