At the Women in the World summit in the New York honing her pitch to be the nation’s first female president, Clinton lamented “pure ideology, pure partisanship” in American politics today and warned that “we cannot afford to have people who deny the right and the need for compromise.” It’s a good pitch for Clinton who needs to soften her political image and develop a rationale beyond her gender and 90s nostalgia for voters to grant a third Clinton term in the White House. But it’s not very good for President Obama who, halfway across the country, was escalating his partisan attacks to a new, weird level.[Dems join GOP for ObamaCare changes - Eighteen Democrats joined with House Republicans in voting to scrap ObamaCare’s 30 hour-a-week definition of full time work. More.]This stinkburger tastes gamy - While Clinton was oozing bipartisanship in New York, Obama went to the University of Michigan this week to attack Republican (but not Democratic) opponents of his call to increase the federal minimum wage by 40 percent. How about Republican counterproposals like the fiscal plan on offer from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan? If it was a sandwich at a local delicatessen, Obama said, Ryan’s plan would have to be called “the stinkburger” or the “Meanwich.” Keeping with the attack mode of taunting GOPers as he did in his remarks Tuesday celebrating the end (kind of) of the open enrollment period for his health-insurance entitlement program, Obama was revving up the base with just the kind of “pure partisanship” decried by Obama’s 2008 rival and prospective successor. This dichotomy is likely to only get worse as Democrats face a difficult choice in a difficult election year: embrace the base with Obama-style attacks or run to the middle, a la Clinton.

Arkansas, by the way, is home to one of the Democrats who oppose Obama’s minimum-wage hike, the highly vulnerable Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Arkansas also has a state-level alternative to Obama’s minimum wage plan designed to protect low-income jobs. The 42nd president will campaign for his former head of Emergency Management., James Lee Witt who is seeking Rep. Tom Cotton’s, R-Ark., House seat as Cotton takes on Pryor. Clinton heads to Little Rock on Sunday to campaign for Democratic Mayor Pat Hays. The high pressure from expected midterm losses, compounded by 2016 positioning, is threatening to break apart what remains of the Obama’s once-doughty coalition.[Inky and Hinky - Noonan: “Given a program whose complexity is so utter and defeating that it defies any normal human attempt at comprehension, two things will happen. Those inclined to like the spirit of the thing will support it on the assumption the government knows what it’s doing. And the opposition will find it difficult to effectively oppose – or repeal the thing – because of the program's bureaucratic density and complexity. It's like wrestling a manic, many-armed squid in ink-darkened water.”]OBAMACARE STILL CRASHING
Enrollments trail cancellations in Maryland - CNSNews: “The head of the Maryland Health Insurance Exchange testified Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that only 60,000 people have signed up for Obamacare through the state’s exchange - 13,000 less than the number of individuals reported to lose their insurance due to Obamacare.”State blight roundup - WSJ: “Oregon's website still isn't fully functional: Applicants can't secure a policy without a worker finishing the task by hand. Maryland this week voted to scrap its exchange and build a new one at an expected cost of $40 million to $50 million. Hawaii's exchange has attracted just 7,242 enrollees, not enough to keep it financially viable in the long run, state officials said. The exchange also is struggling to process a backlog of 11,000 applicants who didn't get coverage by the March 31 enrollment deadline.”Insurance lockout - AP: “Many people who didn't sign up during the government's open enrollment period that ended Monday will soon find it difficult or impossible to get insured this year, even if they go directly to a private company and money is no object. For some it's already too late. With limited exceptions, insurers are refusing to sell to individuals after the enrollment period for HealthCare.gov and the state marketplaces. They will lock out the young and healthy as well as the sick or injured.”Deadline redux - Fox News: “The White House announced Thursday that April 15 will be the new deadline to sign up for ObamaCare. The two-week extension came after a series of technical glitches earlier in the week prevented people from filing new online applications. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 100,000 people were using the system on March 31 – the previous deadline to sign up for President Obama’s signature [law].”RIGHT TIME, WRONG PLACE…WaPo: “After he’d finished a lengthy opening to his question, a staffer slipped [Sen.

It was not always so. This summer will mark the 50th anniversary of the New York World’s Fair, which sprang from and helped shape a Midcentury culture not only obsessed with futurism but imbued with the belief that the toil and strife that had marked every chapter of human history could be swept away by ever more prosperity and technology. Americans of the era seem largely to have believed that the future would be like their present, in which Postwar affluence, common purpose and the wonders of science would produce the culture of which Progressives had long dreamed. Until James Rosen no doubt one day writes an even better book on the topic, we will have “Tomorrow-Land” from Joseph Tirella, a historian whose native Queens played host to the fair. Lauren Zelt reviews Tirella’s work for The Weekly Standard, harkening to a time when 51 million people in a nation of 190 million would come to marvel at the mirage of a future that seemed so real.Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, leaned on his rural family upbringing to try to soften the blow with voters. “I made a mistake. Braley said. “And good people who listened to my comments – people who I respect and admire – were upset by what I said. If my dad were still alive, he'd probably be telling me not to get too big for my britches.… My parents both grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression.

More than 800 supporters, allies, aides and even former opponents of Mr. Bush, the 41st president, will gather in College Station, Tex., on Friday for a three-day reunion to mark the 25th anniversary of the first Bush administration and try to burnish its legacy along the way…”[43 has his debut - WSJ: “George W.

If you have, there may be something more tangible out there, for a price of course. Inspired by this tweet, Brian Thompson, a writer and marketing pro, decided to act on his wife’s frustration over his Twitter obsession and launched #PermanentRetweet on April 1 (not a prank says he). “If you really, really like a tweet, you now can get it laser-etched onto a small piece of wood or metal,” Yahoo news reports. Thompson’s custom “permanent tweets’ cost $20 for wood, $25 for metal. The entrepreneur also offers the tweet that inspired him to customers. “’That tweet,’ Thompson told Yahoo, ‘just got me off my ass to actually execute the idea.’… As for his wife’s point about Thompson being a little too distracted by Twitter? ‘Of course,’ he concedes, ‘now I probably spend more time looking for great tweets, so that backfired on her.’”Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
