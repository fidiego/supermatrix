Obama pledges "more humane" immigration enforcement
President Barack Obama ordered a review of immigration enforcement at a time when his administration is being strongly criticized by the Hispanic community, which is about to surpass the 2 million mark in deportations.That was announced by the White House in a communique after Obama met Thursday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Ruben Hinojosa, CHC Immigration Task Force Chair Luis Gutierrez and Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Xavier Becerra.The president told the Congress members that "he has asked Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to do an inventory of the Department's current practices to see how it can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law", the statement said.Obama, the statement said, also "emphasized his deep concern about the pain too many families feel from the separation that comes from our broken immigration system."Thursday's White House meeting reached a moment when lawmakers put the finishing touches on a resolution urging him to use all legal measures to suspend, delay or cancel the deportation of immigrants, media outlets said.His deportation policy has earned Obama harsh criticism from the Hispanic community, whose support was key in his two presidential campaigns.The latest to raise her voice against the president was National Council of La Raza head Janet Murguia, who recently called him the "deporter in chief" for the record number of deportations during his presidency.One out of every four deportees is the parent of a U.S.-born child, according to figures compiled by La Raza.
