This struggle keeps happening,” Luna continued. “The struggle and fight of these people is still so much alive, and they deserve attention. Hopefully this film can draw attention, not just to farm workers but to all of those workers that today are feeding the country, that are building this country that deserve immigration reform.”“Cesar Chavez” tells the story of famed Mexican-American labor leader’s fight to unionize farm workers in California. Chavez, who founded the United Farm Workers of America, fought to win better pay and conditions for the laborers picking grapes in the fields.“There’s more than 11 million workers today that are making America what it is and don’t share the same rights as those who are consuming the products or of those who are enjoying the fruits of their labor,” Luna told The Wrap.Michael Peña (“American Hustle”) plays Chavez in the film, while American Ferrera (“Ugly Betty”) plays his wife. Rosario Dawson (“Sin City”) portrays Chavez’s ally and labor leader union leader Dolores Huerta.
