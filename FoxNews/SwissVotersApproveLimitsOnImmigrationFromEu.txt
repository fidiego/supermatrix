Swiss voters approve limits on immigration from EU
Swiss voters decided in a referendum Sunday to limit the entry of citizens of European Union countries into their labor market by imposing annual quotas.The official results from all the Swiss cantons - with the exception of Zurich, where the voting in one district is still under way, although the results there will not change the final tally - show that 50.4 percent of voters supported the so-called "Against mass migration" initiative.The proposal by the extreme rightist Democratic Union of the Center, or UDC - also known as the Swiss People's Party - reestablishes the principle of preference for Swiss workers over foreigners, a measures that had been abolished for all workers coming from EU nations.The result will force a renegotiation of the bilateral agreement between Switzerland and the EU regarding the free circulation of people, which has been in force since 2002.All political commentators and representatives of the economic media are asking what the reaction of Brussels will be to the vote and the fear is that the EU will decide to renegotiate the full package of agreements that regulate its relations with Switzerland.The consequences for the Swiss economy and the labor market could be very negative, analysts said.During the course of the campaign prior to the referendum, the UDC said that immigration was causing an unsustainable increase in the country's population and creating problems such as rising unemployment, particularly in border regions.The party blamed immigrants for rising real estate prices, the overcrowding on trains, traffic problems and unfair salary competition.About a quarter of the eight million people living in Switzerland are foreigners.
