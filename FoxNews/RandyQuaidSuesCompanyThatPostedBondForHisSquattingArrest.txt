Actor Randy Quaid arrives at Canadian Immigration Court prior to a hearing in Vancouver, British Columbia.ReutersActor Randy Quaid has sued a suburban Indianapolis bond company that bailed Quaid and his wife out of jail after they were arrested on squatting charges in California in 2010.The Indianapolis Star reports the 63-year-old "Independence Day" star sued Carmel, Ind.-based American Surety in Hamilton County Court, saying the company posted two $50,000 bonds for the couple without being asked, obligating them to repay bonds that they hadn't requested.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTRandy and Evi Quaid were arrested in September 2010 on suspicion that they were living in the guest house of a Montecito, Calif., home they previously owned. Authorities said at the time the Quaids were suspected of causing more than $5,000 in damage.A month later, the Quaids were detained by immigration police in Vancouver after a California judge issued a bench warrant for their arrest. They missed a hearing scheduled for Oct. 18, 2010, but the Quaids say they were never notified that a court date had been set.American Surety posted two $50,000 bonds for the couple, but the Quaids contend in an April 10 Indiana court filing that they never authorized the company to issue the bonds."The Quaids did not enter into a written agreement with American or its agent to provide the $50,000 bonds and did not agree to pay any sums to American or its agent in exchange for the bonds," their attorney wrote in court documents.The couple is seeking unspecified damages for lost wages and emotional distress.American Surety and their lawyer had no immediate comment Friday.Randy Quaid, 63, is best-known for supporting roles in films such as "Independence Day" and "National Lampoon's Vacation."
