Australian man asks US government to reopen green card case after his American husband dies
LOS ANGELES –  A 72-year-old Australian man widowed by his American husband of more than three decades is renewing his pitch for a green card since the Obama administration eased policies on gay marriage.Anthony Sullivan asked immigration authorities Monday to reopen a petition filed in 1975 by his late husband, Richard Adams, so he can be awarded legal residency as the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe two were married during a brief period when a county clerk in Boulder, Colo., issued marriage licenses to gay couples in 1975. But the U.S. refused to grant immigration benefits for them.A spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to comment on the case. The agency began issuing green cards to married gay couples last year after a Supreme Court ruling.
