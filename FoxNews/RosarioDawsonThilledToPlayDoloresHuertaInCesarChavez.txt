Rosario Dawson thilled to play Dolores Huerta in "Cesar Chavez"
In the film biography "Cesar Chavez," Rosario Dawson had the honor of playing one of the women who admires him most, Dolores Huerta - the righthand person for the union leader - who continues to be active at 83 and tweeted the actress to congratulate her on her performance."She's a woman who continues writing her own story, who is very active, who continues to collaborate with multiple causes. I had the privilege of getting to know her when we were at a meeting on immigration where she was with Maria Teresa Kumar (of Voto Latino) and politician Lawrence O'Donnell," Dawson told Efe in an interview.Diego Luna made the film more than 20 years after the death of the labor leader, who in the 1960s took up the struggle for the rights of Latino workers and founded the United Farm Workers, for which Huerta was co-founder and vice president.In this film, which opens in theaters on March 28 starring Michael Pe√±a, America Ferrara and John Malkovich, Dawson has been able to synthesize her two careers: artist and activist.In the artistic area, she has transformed herself into one of the most influential Latinas in the United States thanks to her work in films like "Kids" and "25th hour," both containing extensive social content, as well as purely entertainment films like "Sin City" and "Death Proof."In the activist area, although she has taken up causes such as gay rights and the environment, her main focus of activity has been raising awareness among the Latino community about the importance of its members' votes via the Voto Latino organization.
