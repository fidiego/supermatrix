Sen. Schumer Calls Out GOP: Pass Immigration Reform Now To Go Into Effect After Obama Leaves Office
WASHINGTON (AP) –  Sen. Chuck Schumer says he has an easy fix to the GOP's latest doubts about overhauling the nation's immigration laws.Pass legislation this year, but don't let the law go into effect until after President Barack Obama's second term ends.The New York Democrat offered his idea Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press in response to House Speaker John Boehner. The Ohio Republican recently cast doubts on the prospects for an immigration overhaul this year, saying President Barack Obama can't be trusted to implement the law.“There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws, and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," Boehner said Thursday, after months of saying he wanted to move ahead with reform and releasing a set of principles in late January outlining such a bill.”Schumer said he believes that Boehner's rap against Obama is false. He said Obama has deported more immigrants living illegally in the U.S. than any other president, but it would be easy enough to pass the law this year to start in 2017.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino
