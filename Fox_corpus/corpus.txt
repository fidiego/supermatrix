132 Haitian migrants intercepted in Bahamas Authorities intercepted 132 undocumented Haitian migrants during a routine patrol near Ragged Island, the Bahamian government said Tuesday.The group includes 22 women and six children.The migrants were apprehended aboard a sloop with the assistance of local fishermen, police said.None of the Haitians managed to reach the shore of Ragged Island, according to the Bahamas' director of Immigration, William Pratt."The whole boat was apprehended. And from what I was told, they all appear to be in good health, but when they get in Nassau the medical team will examine them," he said.Authorities are still trying to determine exactly where and when the migrants began their journey.Pratt said the immigrants were being transported to a detention center on New Providence island.That facility, according to officials, is already holding 202 migrants, including 126 Haitians.Immigration officers picked up around 90 Haitian immigrants in Exuma last week during a special operation, Pratt said, adding that both the Exuma and the Ragged Island contingents will likely be repatriated to Haiti by the end of this week."We don't want the detention center to get overcrowded," he said.

13 Migrants kidnapped on Mexican-U.S. border, Amnesty International says Thirteen migrants were apparently kidnapped by a gang in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas and their lives may be in danger, Amnesty International said Thursday.Army troops rescued about 40 migrants on March 19 in Reynosa, located across the border from McAllen, Texas, but 10 of the migrants were abducted a second time as they made their way to a shelter, AI said.The 10 migrants "were heading to a Catholic shelter when they were once again kidnapped and their whereabouts is unknown," the human rights group said.Shelter workers reported the mass kidnapping, but no law enforcement personnel have spoken with them or started investigating "what happened or the location of the migrants," AI said.On March 18, a day before the kidnapping, three women deported by U.S. officials "were presumably kidnapped in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, near the border crossing," AI said.A fourth woman "managed to get away and ran to a nearby bus station, where she told police what happened, but the search launched (by officers) did not turn up any leads on the whereabouts of the three women," the human rights group said.AI said it was "deeply concerned about the safety of the kidnapped individuals."Federal and state officials should open a "complete and impartial" investigation to determine what happened to the migrants, AI said.Authorities should offer protection to migrants rescued from gangs and to those deported from the United States, AI said.Criminal organizations, working with corrupt Mexican officials, commit all kinds of crimes, including kidnapping, extortion and rape, against migrants, the human rights group said.Mexican immigration agents stopped 82,269 migrants in 2013, of whom 75,704 were deported.The vast majority of migrants are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.A total of 278 kidnappings were reported during the first two months of this year, up 11 percent from the same period in 2013.Human rights activists, however, say only about 10 percent of the kidnappings in Mexico are reported to authorities.National Anti-Kidnapping Coordination organization head Renato Sales said Tuesday that criminal organizations that previously focused on peddling drugs on the streets "are now staging kidnappings for small sums."

30 Members of a drug gang arrested in Puerto Rico At least 30 members of the same gang engaged in trafficking drugs at a public housing project in San Juan were arrested Tuesday, also charged with illegal possession of arms.The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Puerto Rico, Angel Melendez, told Efe that the gang's center of operations was in the Nemesio Canales building next to Plaza Las Americas, the biggest shopping mall in the Caribbean."It's an organization considered to be extremely violent, well organized, that has its leaders, drug suppliers and others who provide security for gang members," Melendez said.Those in custody are on the list of suspects drawn up by the Office of the U.S. Attorney in San Juan, which includes the names of others who have mostly been arrested, tried and jailed previously.Collaborating in this operation have been the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Puerto Rico Police Department and Border Patrol.The economic crisis that Puerto Rico has been going through for the past seven years has not helped eliminate one of the island's main problems: streets that have become the scene for settling scores between criminal gangs trying to control drug points of sale.

4 ways to cure an unhealthy relationship with food My teenage daughter's summer job was at an ice cream shop. She asked me to swing by one day so she could make me a sundae. I should have run over there and slurped down my treat with unfettered joy. But I begged off. The thought of eating a sauce-covered mountain of sugar and fat gave me a jolt of guilt and shame. I hadn't even entered the store, and I was already full of regret.It's awful being in a dysfunctional relationship with food. I would compare it to regrettable hookups with losers in my past, but those flings didn't last very long. Food and I have been breaking up and making up since childhood. The worst part? Our affair is completely one-sided. A cheeseburger doesn't know I exist. My feelings for a cheeseburger, however, are complicated. But although I'm a chronic dieter, my eating habits are considered normal. I don't have a clinical disorder like bulimia or anorexia. I simply want to be thin and healthy.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAnd I'm not the only one, judging from my friends, the best-seller lists and the cult of Whole Foods. We live in a world in which we know self-starvation is bad, but somehow believe drinking only juice is good. "Our obsession with appearance, our fixation on diet and our food- and information-abundant culture have given rise to an epidemic of unhealthy relationships with food," said Dr. Michelle May, author of Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat. "Food has become our focus instead of being the fuel for a full life."To ease the strangle-hold your diet has over you, consider what about it leaves you so powerless. Check out the following culprits. Chances are, you can relate to at least one—if not all—of them.Health.com: 16 Ways to Lose Weight Fast Problem No. 1: You're ruled by rules A healthy romantic partnership revolves around compromise. Some women, though, treat food like they would an unpredictable puppy—something to be disciplined. Ann, a photographer in New York City, keeps a list of food rules on her fridge."Just a few," she said. "No sugar, no white or fried food, no dairy, no gluten and no carbonation. I do eat beef."A friend from Orlando packs a separate suitcase for her protein bars when she travels to make sure she won't be tempted by dubious hotel offerings. On a recent trip, there was an issue about bringing food into a country. She freaked out at immigration, ranted hysterically and cried. The officials were so shocked, they let her keep her bars.This kind of rigidity is all about fear of losing control, said Susan Albers, PsyD, author of 50 Ways to Soothe Yourself Without Food."Our minds love to think in black-and-white terms," Albers pointed out. "Right versus wrong. Fat versus thin. Perfect versus ruined."Or that's how it might seem when in the throes of an obsession."Some people feel lost without structure," added Mary Pritchard, professor in the department of psychology at Boise State University. "Walking into a restaurant or opening a fridge kicks off an algorithm of counting."These thoughts aren't limited to type As, though. They're on a mental loop in many of our heads, thanks to an overload of (often conflicting) information about what we should and shouldn't be eating. And unless you clue into this desire for dietary perfection, you can do serious damage to your self-esteem."When you break a rule, that can spiral into 'I'm a bad person,'" Albers noted. "But food isn't good or bad. There are 50 shades in between. Rule-based eating doesn't take hunger and cravings into account."And that sets you up for a fall when your stomach starts grumbling and you're forced to deviate from your well-laid eating plans. Instead of sticking with a regimen, try to be a bit less strict."I encourage women to eat a wide variety of foods," Albers said. "It's healthier from a nutritional and emotional standpoint." Of course, that's much easier said than done.A half-step: Every day, break your rules, just a bit."Start small," she urged. "A piece of bread. Pasta once a week. When you see that nothing bad happens, flexibility won't be as intimidating. You might even enjoy it."Health.com: 14 Ways to Cut Portions Without Feeling HungryProblem No. 2: You don't trust yourself Another given in a healthy relationship is trust—believing you and your partner will do the right thing when faced with temptation. In a dysfunctional "foodship"—as I like to call it—distrust can be rampant. I know I am weak around cake, for instance. To keep from eating too much, I have doused baked goods in water. A friend told me, "I use hot sauce." Another: "Liquid soap."My friend Rachel from New Jersey has a full bag of tricks."I use a timer between bites," she explained. "When I'm done, I freeze the leftovers so I won't eat them. My boyfriend is in charge of doling out snacks under the instruction that he can't give me more than my allotment, even if I beg."It's not our fault that it's so hard to resist chips and candy. It's plain biology: Eating carbohydrates (plentiful in pizza and cupcakes, but not so much in kale) boosts our levels of the feel-good hormone serotonin. And we may have happy childhood associations with certain treats. No wonder that some of us crave comfort food when we're upset, bored, lonely, etcetera. Stress triggers a jones for sugar; cookies are readily available. If you try not to think about the treat, your mind just becomes fixated. So when you finally buy the cookies, you're too obsessed to stop at just one (or three).If we were more mindful of hunger cues, though, we'd make better choices."Before eating, pause to ask yourself, Does my body need fuel? Why am I thinking about food if my body doesn't need it?" May said.If you do need to eat, listen to your cravings: Indulging a little now can keep you from overdoing it later, Dr. May notes. As for how much to eat, your body can help with that, too."The right amount is about feeling good," May said, and not uncomfortably stuffed afterward.Health.com: 31 Superfood Secre ets for a Long and Healthy LifeProblem No. 3: You Beat Yourself Up Imagine having a boyfriend who, after you made a small mistake, called you a worthless failure. You'd dump his butt. But many of us do the same thing to ourselves if we dare to enjoy a piece of cake. "The food-as-enemy voice shames you for overindulging," Albers said. "The food-as-friend voice is a cheerleader. If you mess up, it encourages you to get back on track."To silence your inner bitch, steer dark food thoughts to the light. When you're being hypercritical—I'm a failure. Everyone thinks I'm fat—stop and listen to what you're saying to yourself. Then replace the harmful message with a kind one, like No one's perfect. My friends and family love me. Over time, this will become natural.Speaking of family and friends, do yours include dieters who are even more critical than you are? They're not helping. Your ideal dining companions: "People who eat slowly and take pleasure in their food," Albers said.Health.com: Best Superfoods for Weight LossProblem No. 4: You really, really want to be skinny A healthy relationship is honest. An unhealthy one is full of deception. I know I lied to myself during a recent juice fast. I said I was doing it for the antioxidants. Bull! I wanted to lose weight. "The number one cause of food restriction is body dissatisfaction," Pritchard said. "Ninety percent of women don't like what they see in the mirror."There's nothing wrong with wanting to be slim. But depriving yourself of crucial nutrients (or eating only a select few)—whether through cleanses, fasts or cutting out food groups—and pretending it's all for the good of your health is a dangerous game. Ironically, it can backfire and set off the "starve, binge, hate yourself" cycle that makes you gain weight instead.And all that negative self-talk is no recipe for weight loss, either. I know that when I'm nicer to myself, I tend to eat better and maintain a weight that's healthier for my body—and my sanity. "In our culture, so much is driven by shallow perceptions of what's worthwhile," May said. "By obsessing about weight loss, we're not achieving what we're capable of. It's crowding out stuff that's more important"—like our happiness and well-being. I'll eat to that.This article originally appeared on Health.com. 
$50M worth of cocaine seized off Puerto Rico's north coast SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico –  Federal authorities have seized $50 million worth of cocaine after intercepting a boat off Puerto Rico's north coast.U.S. prosecutor Carlos Cardona said Wednesday that more than 1.7 metric tons (3,700 pounds) of cocaine were found aboard a boat headed toward the north coastal town of Dorado.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said authorities are still investigating where the boat had departed from as it headed toward the U.S. territory. Two people have been arrested.Authorities said Monday's seizure is among the largest in Puerto Rico in recent years. 
5 immigration detainees on fifth day of hunger strike at Washington detention center TACOMA, Wash. –  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say a hunger strike at the Northwest Detention Center in Washington state that started with hundreds of participants is down to five detainees on its fifth day, and they are under medical evaluation.The agency said Tuesday that 27 people had refused to eat at the start of the day. They were placed under medical observation and separated from others at the Tacoma facility. By Tuesday afternoon, 22 detainees had eaten, and five remained on hunger strike and under medical evaluation.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTDetainees are seeking better food and treatment. Some want to be released on bond while their cases are heard.At one point, about 750 of the center's nearly 1,300 detainees refused to eat.Detainees were told Monday of the potential consequences of remaining on a hunger strike, including forced feeding. 
750 immigration detainees on hunger strike TACOMA, Wash. –  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement department has confirmed that 750 detainees at the Northwest Detention Center have refused to eat and say they are on a hunger strike.An immigrant activist says the hunger strike started Friday as a protest of deportations as well as center conditions.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe center currently houses nearly 1,300 people, being investigated for possible deportation.ICE spokesman Andrew Munoz says the agency respects the right of people to express their opinions without interference.The detainees are under continuous observation by center staff and medical personnel.Activist Maru Mora says the hunger strikers are seeking better food and treatment as well as better pay for center jobs.ICE detention standards state that a detainee who has not eaten for 72 hours is considered to be on a hunger strike. 
ACLU Asks Court To Strike Down Arizona Law Denying Undocumented Immigrants Bail SAN FRANCISCO (AP) –  The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday urged a federal appeals court to strike down an Arizona law that denies bail to immigrants in the country illegally, a voter-approved law that Arizona's lawyers call necessary to prevent criminal suspects from fleeing the U.S.ACLU attorney Cecelia Wang asked a special 11-member panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to find the law unconstitutional, saying immigrants are being unfairly singled out as flight risks.The case marks the latest battle over Arizona's crackdowns on illegal immigration from the past decade. Arizona voters passed the law in 2006 to deny bail to people who are in the country illegally and charged with certain felonies, such as murder, sexual assault and even aggravated identity theft.Wang argued that no empirical data exist that show immigrants are any more of a flight risk than others cut loose before their final court appearances.The ACLU and other legal aid groups maintain that the Latino detainees are unfairly held while other nationalities are allowed to put up bond in exchange for their freedom before trial."It's unfair to subject a certain subsection of the population to rules that don't apply to everyone else," Wang said.Lawyers for the state argue that the law prevents defendants from fleeing the country before their court hearings.Arizona Assistant Attorney General Tim Casey noted that Proposition 100 was approved by 78 percent of the voters. Casey argued that the law is in the "compelling interest in keeping Arizona safe and undocumented workers out of the country."A smaller three-judge panel rejected the ACLU's arguments in 2011, but the organization appealed to a larger en banc panel of 11 judges.Four of the judges Tuesday asked questions of both sides but gave no indication of how they would rule. One judge, Marsha Berzon, asked rhetorically, "How does one overturn the will of an overwhelming majority of voters to support the (federal) law?"It could take months before the court rules, and the outcome can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.Arizona is one of at least three states with laws confronting the issue of bail for people in the country without authorization. Missouri and Virginia have similar laws.Arizona passed the no-bail law as it targeted illegal immigration through a series of measures in the Legislature and at the ballot box. It was among four immigration proposals approved by Arizonans in 2006. The no-bail law was proposed by then-state Rep. Russell Pearce, who would later succeed in pushing through Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration enforcement law.The challengers say the push by the Arizona Legislature to put the measure on the ballot was permeated with the intent to punish people in the country illegally for federal immigration violations. They also argue the state law is trumped by federal law.The lawyers defending the law say its intent was to improve public safety, not punish people for federal immigration violations. They also said the state law doesn't conflict with federal law.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
ACLU celebra la aprobaciÃ³n de ley de matrÃ­cula de residentes para "soÃ±adores" Miami, 2 may (EFEUSA).- La UniÃ³n Americana de Libertades Civiles de Florida (ACLUF) aplaudiÃ³ la ratificaciÃ³n hoy de la CÃ¡mara de Representantes del proyecto de ley que otorga matrÃ­culas universitarias como residentes a decenas de miles de "soÃ±adores" de este estado.La medida, que ya habÃ­a sido este jueves debatida y aprobada en el Pleno del Senado con algunas enmiendas, supone el fin de la "polÃ­tica que exigÃ­a que los 'DREAMers' pagaran una tasa de matrÃ­cula universitaria tres o cuatro veces superior a la de sus compaÃ±eros de clase", destacÃ³ la ACLUF en un comunicado."DespuÃ©s de aÃ±os de esfuerzo, la equidad en la matrÃ­cula universitaria finamente estÃ¡ en camino al escritorio del gobernador" de Florida, Rick Scott, quien ya dejÃ³ claro recientemente que firmarÃ­a la ley tan pronto como llegase a sus manos.El director ejecutivo de ACLUF, Howard Simon, asegurÃ³ que se trata no solo de una "victoria para las decenas de miles de estudiantes de Florida", que ahora podrÃ¡n acceder al "sueÃ±o de una educaciÃ³n universitaria", sino tambiÃ©n el triunfo de un "sistema de educaciÃ³n superior mÃ¡s justo".Esta ley termina de una vez con la "prÃ¡ctica de exigir a miles de estudiantes de Florida el pago de matrÃ­cula al coste de aquellos que viven fuera del estado" o "simplemente por su estatus migratorio" irregular, insistiÃ³ la ACLU.En opiniÃ³n de Simon, los votos favorables emitidos en el Senado y la CÃ¡mara de Representantes representan una "ruptura de la rÃ­gida oposiciÃ³n polÃ­tica que muchos en la Legislatura de Florida" habÃ­an mantenido "ante cualquier iniciativa que beneficiara a la comunidad inmigrante de nuestro estado".Varios grupos a favor de los inmigrantes, entre otros la CoaliciÃ³n de Inmigrantes de Florida (FLIC), Students Working for Equal Rights (SWER) y Reform Immigration For America (RI4A), junto con la ACLU, habÃ­an batallado desde hace aÃ±os por la aprobaciÃ³n de "la equidad de la matrÃ­cula".Por 85 votos a favor y 32 en contra, el Pleno de la CÃ¡mara de Representantes dio luz verde al proyecto de ley HB851, que ofrece las ventajas de la matrÃ­cula estatal a los estudiantes indocumentados que asistieron a una escuela de secundaria en Florida durante tres aÃ±os y concluyeron sus estudios.

Activist Barred By Dominican Immigration Officials To Travel To US For Meeting With Human Rights Group SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) –  Dominican immigration officers have barred a woman of Haitian descent who's fighting for Dominican citizenship from flying to the U.S. to meet with a human rights body.A legal challenge by Juliana Deguis Pierre resulted in a Dominican constitutional court ruling last year that could let the government retroactively strip citizenship mostly from people of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic.Pierre went to Santo Domingo's airport Sunday with lawyers headed for a U.S. meeting of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which will discuss the citizenship issue at a Monday meeting in Washington.Pierre showed immigration officers a special document provided to her by the U.S. State Department. But the Dominican officers decided it was not sufficient to allow her to travel on an international flight and said she needs a passport.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Activists On Both Sides Of Immigration Debate Unhappy With President Obama's State Of The Union Speech President Obama’s State of the Union address drew a mixed review, even from his supporters.In particular, many Latino groups and advocates for more lenient immigration policies expressed bewilderment over Obama’s fleeting mention of the need to reform the system to both tighten border security and provide a path to legal status for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.And again, many vented their frustration over his record rate of deportations – more than any other U.S. president."The President spent barely 30 seconds talking about immigration reform, the issue that affects 11 million lives and that matters the most to 53 million Latinos," said Jonathan Fried, executive director of the Florida-based WeCount, a group that favors more flexible immigration laws. “Once again, President Obama mentioned he supports immigration reform, but talking won't keep our families together when they are being separated every day.”Fried continued: “The President can prove that he truly cares about our families by stopping the deportation of our family members now and easing our communities' suffering. Otherwise he will still be known in our communities as the deporter-in-chief.”The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, lauded Obama’s call for helping more Americans improve their financial health.“Following the Great Recession, the Latino community has found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet--experiencing higher rates of unemployment, foreclosure, and loss of household wealth,” according to a NALEO statement. “ By implementing policies that grow the economy, spur job creation and make college more accessible for all Americans, more Latinos will be able to pursue their piece of the American Dream, resulting in a more skilled work force and an expanded middle class."The organization appealed for the kind of bipartisan spirit in Washington D.C. that has been in tatters in the last several years.“We urge Congress and the President to work together on bipartisan measures,” the statement said, “such as early learning and college readiness programs that will foster educational and economic opportunity for this increasingly significant sector of the population and all Americans in the coming year.”Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, echoed many of his fellow GOP lawmakers when he took aim at the president’s determination to act unilaterally on certain issues – by using executive orders -- if Congress does not work with him."While the President discussed some areas of common interest, the heart of his 2014 agenda is clearly more about working alone than with the American people's representatives on the major reforms we need,” Rubio said. Rubio characterized some of the programs that Obama pushed as a big-government approach that undermines the upward mobility the president said he was interested in expanding for more Americans."President Obama missed an opportunity on several fronts, especially by insisting that Washington keep spending more money than it takes in,” Rubio said, “keep dictating to entrepreneurs how to run their businesses, and failing to level with the American people about how we can save our retirement programs. We need a real opportunity agenda that helps people seize the enormous potential that the coming years hold."Groups that back stricter immigration policies said that Obama’s support for reform measures that would expand foreign worker visa programs and allow millions of undocumented immigrants to legalize their status is at cross purposes with the concept of helping more Americans improve their economic situation and job opportunities."These two policy goals are mutually incompatible," said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, the nation's largest anti-illegal-immigration lobby group. "With 92 million working age Americans either unemployed, under-employed, or not participating in the labor market, the president's immigration agenda would only further depress the wages of most American workers.”Income disparity goes hand in hand with reducing illegal immigration, Stein noted.“No amount of government regulation, or mandated increases in the minimum wage, will narrow the income gap so long as the supply of labor dramatically exceeds the demand for workers."Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Activists set out for immigrant detention center in Arizona Activists and leaders of efforts to defend immigrants on Wednesday here began a march that will end on April 5 at Arizona's Eloy Detention Center, where they will demand an end to deportations and approval of immigration reform."We must fight. It's unfair that so many people are in jail just for wanting to work and earn money for their families," Martha Espinoza, 63, told Efe as the procession prepared to leave Phoenix.Espinoza, who was born in Veracruz, Mexico, and has been living in the United States for 14 years, was detained last year during a workplace raid carried out by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.She spent three months in jail and was later transferred to a detention center.Guatemalan immigrant Anselma Lopez also will participate in the march and said that she is carrying the photograph of her son Elder Gomez, who has already been in the Eloy Detention Center for two years.Lopez was also part of a group of demonstrators who last month staged a hunger strike in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix."We're ready not to eat, to walk, to do whatever it takes to get him out of that place," Lopez told Efe."There are thousands of families like mine who are separated, who are suffering. So, we're asking President Obama to stop the deportations. We're not people who came here to hurt anyone, we just want to work freely," she emphasized.The march participants will walk approximately 70 miles during the next three days."We're fed up with so many deportations. We did the hunger strike and we didn't get any results. Now we're marching, we're not going to give up," Lourdes Hernandez, a mother of four whose husband is currently being held in the Eloy Detention Center, told Efe. EFE 
After Appearing To Move Toward Immigration Reform, Speaker Boehner Says 'Not Yet' A week ago, House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, raised hope and drew praise from many groups that push for more lenient immigration policies when he released a set of so-called "immigration principles" that seemed to hint that he and other GOP leaders were ready to work on legislation that would overhaul laws governing the border, visas and undocumented people in the U.S.Boehner and other Republican leaders in the House, where their party holds the majority, indicated that they were ready to roll up their sleeves and work on immigration measures with the possibility of votes this year.But on Thursday, the speaker struck a different tune, shocking many who closely follow the immigration issue.Boehner all but ruled out passage of immigration legislation before this fall's elections, saying it would be difficult for the Republican-led House to act on the issue that President Barack Obama has made a top domestic priority.In his most pessimistic comments, Boehner blamed the stalemate on widespread skepticism that Obama would properly enforce any immigration reforms that Congress approved. The GOP leader didn't mention that his own members have balked at acting on the contentious issue, which could enrage core conservative voters in the midterm election year."The American people, including many of our members, don't trust that the reform we're talking about will be implemented as it was intended to be," Boehner told reporters at his weekly news conference. "The president seems to change the health care law on a whim, whenever he likes. Now, he is running around the country telling everyone he's going to keep acting on his own."Just last week, Boehner and other House Republican leaders had unveiled broad principles for immigration changes, including legal status for the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally, tougher border security and a shot at citizenship for children brought to the country illegally.Groups that favor an immigration reform measure that would provide a path to legal status quickly condemned what they said was Boehner's about-face. “Today, Speaker John Boehner reminded us how his party continues to test the patience of American voters, showing particular disdain for the views of Latino, Asian and young voters," said the Service Employees International Union’s (SEIU) Executive Vice President Rocio Saenz in a statement. "The urgency to pass reform has never been louder, the moral crisis caused by our broken immigration system has never been starker, and the bipartisan support has never been clearer."“Republicans have a choice: they can pander to a small, extremist arm of the GOP and follow them into the political wilderness or they can do the right thing for our nation and pass immigration reform."National Republicans see the failure to act on immigration as a political drag on the party after 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney captured just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, and they are pressing for action to moderate the party's image. The principles endorsed last week were seen as a congressional jump-start for an issue that had been stalled since Senate passage of a comprehensive, bipartisan bill last June.But conservatives rebuffed their leaders and questioned the wisdom of acting this year, equating legal status with amnesty and resisting giving Obama a long-sought legislative victory. Republicans also worry about primary challenges from the right and fear that new Hispanic citizens will add to the Democrats' voter rolls.Control of the Senate, Republicans say, is within reach, giving them hope for greater leverage in negotiations on immigration in 2015. But the year leading up to the presidential election could be a tough one for making progress since Republican candidates tend to move right to shore up support ahead of the primaries.The latest unraveling on immigration came quickly.Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had advocated for action on immigration within his caucus, said this past weekend that passage of a bill was unlikely this year and cited distrust of Obama. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who faces a primary challenge, said Tuesday that differences between the Senate and House were an "irresolvable conflict."On Thursday, shortly before House members left Washington, Boehner said, "Listen, there's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes."Boehner said Obama has to rebuild that trust. White House spokesman Jay Carney dismissed that demand."The challenges within the Republican Party on this issue are well-known, and they certainly don't have anything to do with the president," Carney said.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she was willing to give Boehner time to succeed. Democrats could try to force the issue later this year, rounding up support to require a vote on the Senate-passed bill."Just knowing him, I believe he does want an immigration bill," Pelosi said of Boehner. "I do believe he does not want to be the speaker who says, 'I'll do an immigration bill as long as it creates an underclass in America.'"The Senate last June passed a bipartisan bill that would tighten border security, provided enforcement measures and offer a path to citizenship for those living in the United States illegally.The measure stalled in the House, where Boehner and other leaders have rejected a comprehensive approach in favor of a bill-by-bill process.Boehner's comments raising doubts about the prospects for action on immigration legislation this year angered advocacy groups."I wish I could say I was surprised Speaker John Boehner is blaming President Obama for his own unwillingness to act on immigration reform," said Eddie Carmona, campaign manager for PICO National Network's Campaign for Citizenship. "The truth is, the speaker has, time and time again, proven that he would rather pander to the extreme portions of his party than work to achieve a bipartisan solution for an issue that impacts countless families and communities across the country."Rocio Saenz, the Service Employees International Union's executive vice president, said Republicans have a choice: "They can pander to a small, extremist arm of the GOP and follow them into the political wilderness or they can do the right thing for our nation and pass immigration reform."Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he didn't "blame Boehner alone. Because the Senate Republican leader threw cold water on this," a reference to McConnell's comments.Yet Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who worked to ensure passage of the Senate bill, said "I'm still optimistic that we'll get this done."Though Obama has threatened to act on his own if Congress does not move on some of his other priorities, Carney signaled that Obama was not prepared to act unilaterally on immigration."There's no alternative to comprehensive immigration reform passing through Congress," Carney said. "It requires legislation. And the president's made that clear in the past, and that continues to be his view."The Associated Press contributed to this story.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

Much like his policy on Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, President Obama seems to believe he has already won, but that it will take time for the world to see his wisdom.[Somebody’s got a case of the Mondays -Visitors to ObamaCare’s online home were told this morning that they couldn’t log on because the government was “performing maintenance.” Maybe they weren’t ready because they were going by whitehouse.gov, which this morning advertised “15 days, 50 hours” until March 31 in a countdown clock at the top of its homepage.]Slim solace for endangered Dems - Retreating into future history is not where the law and its namesake expected to be today. But as Obama’s former campaign manager, David Plouffe, told ABC News on Sunday, Democrats can at least take solace in the fact that the law is unlikely to be repealed. That’s not much solace, however, if you are among the dozen or so Democratic Senate candidates currently having to explain why higher premiums, disrupted coverage and flummoxing federal requirements are necessary parts of improving health care for Americans, even though it wildly misses the mark of its stated aim of covering the uninsured. Despite massive press boosterism, the law has never been able to escape the gravity of its shoddy initial construction and laughably bad rollout.Cleveland Clinic CEO: Three Quarters of ObamaCare holders will find higher premiums - Washington Free Beacon: “A leading healthcare expert poured cold water on the administration’s recent Obamacare enthusiasm, saying that three quarters of those signed up will face higher premiums than under their previous insurance. ‘Out of people that have signed up, about three quarters will find premiums higher than previously with other insurance,’ Dr. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic said on [“Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo”]. ‘Hospitals are going to be paid less for what they do,’ Cosgrove continued. ‘And we also know insurers are paying less too. We have to become more efficient in how we deliver care which is a big change for health care providers.’”Obamacare voter form pre-marked for Dems - Daily Caller: “A couple in La Mesa, California received a voter registration card from California’s Obamacare exchange already pre-marked for the Democratic Party… ‘I’m an old guy and I never would have noticed it, except I have an accountant that notices every dot and dash on a piece of paper as a wife,’ the man who received the card said… Covered California is in the midst of sending out voter registration cards to all of its sign-ups, due to pressure from left-wing groups threatening legal action if they don’t comply… Covered California denied responsibility for the violation.”STUDY: WAGE HIKES HURT JOBSA new study from the conservative American Action Forum finds higher minimum wages required by 19 states increased the number of unemployed Americans by 747,700 and reduced job growth by 83,000.[Watch Fox: Sen.

Christie told Adelson he “misspoke” and that he did not believe that Israel was occupying the disputed area, Andy Abboud, a senior vice president of Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp, said on CNN.

After Four Years, Nebraska Town Finally Ready To Enforce Immigration Law OMAHA, Neb. (AP) –  Four years after Fremont residents first voted to impose restrictions on illegal immigration, the small Nebraska city will finally start requiring renters to get a $5 permit on Thursday.Earlier this year, nearly 60 percent of voters in the conservative city of about 26,000 again backed the housing restrictions that require renters to swear they have legal permission to live in the United States and prohibit landlords from renting to anyone without a city permit.The housing restrictions originally adopted in 2010 had been on hold while lawsuits challenging them worked their way through the courts, and the City Council gave voters a chance to reconsider in February.Now a U.S. Supreme Court review is about the only thing that could stop the permits from being issued."Unless the U.S. Supreme Court jumps in during the next few hours, we're going ahead," Fremont Police Chief Jeff Elliott said Wednesday afternoon.The civil rights groups that challenged Fremont's immigration ordinance in court have asked the nation's high court to evaluate the appeals court ruling that upheld it. And the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska has said it will be watching implementation of the rental rules closely for examples of discrimination that might be grounds for a new lawsuit.Attorney Alonzo Rivas, with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said he expects the Supreme Court to decide this spring whether to hear the case after both sides finish submitting briefs this month.Critics say the immigration restrictions are ineffective and might cost Fremont millions of dollars in legal fees and lost federal grants. They also believe the ordinance has hurt the image of Fremont, which is about 30 miles northwest of Omaha.Most other cities that have tried to restrict illegal immigration — including Hazelton, Pa., and Farmers Branch, Texas — have wound up mired in costly court battles.Beginning Thursday, Elliott said adult renters are required to get the licenses before moving into an apartment or home. Current renters don't have to get permits, but a new permit is required with each move within the city. Application forms in English and Spanish are available at the police station or on the city's website, www.fremontne.gov .Applicants will be asked to supply basic identifying information and swear whether or not they have legal permission to be in the country, either as citizens or legal residents. No identification is required.Initially, everyone who fills out the form and pays the fee will be issued a permit. But those who say they aren't U.S. citizens will have their information submitted to a federal database for review.If the federal government says an applicant is not in the country legally, police will begin revocation procedures. But Elliott said the ordinance prohibits Fremont police from investigating anyone's citizenship status.It's difficult to determine how many people live in Fremont illegally. According to census figures, the town is home to 1,150 noncitizens. That figure includes immigrants who do not have permission to be in the U.S., as well as lawful permanent residents, foreign students and refugees who are legally in the U.S.If a license is revoked, both the renter and the landlord will be informed.Elliott said that if the landlord continues to allow a renter without a license to stay, the landlord could be fined $100. The ordinance doesn't specify any penalties for renters.Another section of Fremont's immigration ordinance that requires employers to use a federal online system to check whether prospective employees are permitted to work in the U.S. has been in place since 2012. Many larger employers, including the major meatpacking plants just outside Fremont, were already using that federal E-Verify system before the ordinance was adopted.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
After lawsuit, feds release hunger strikers from solitary at Washington state detention center SEATTLE –  Lawyers who sued the federal government on behalf of about 20 immigrant hunger strikers at a Washington state detention facility say their clients have been released from solitary confinement.The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and Columbia Legal Services sued on behalf of the men, and say they were returned to the general population by Friday morning after six days in solitary confinement.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn the lawsuit filed this week, the lawyers said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were unlawfully retaliating against the men for exercising their right to free speech.The agency denied that and said the men had been intimidating others to join their hunger strike.The hunger strikers were protesting U.S. immigration law as well as the conditions at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. 
All-Star Panel: Reaction to new rules for clemency This is a rush transcript from "Special Report," April 23, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMES COLE, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: For our criminal justice system to be effective, it needs to not only be fair, but it also must be perceived as being fair. These older stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today's laws erode people's confidence in our criminal justice system.THOMAS DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: By making these sorts of executive orders either on the immigration front or here on the sentencing front, so if he can't get Congress to go along with what he wants, he is sending a signal to his supporters that he's preparing to take executive action unilaterally to accomplish the same thing.(END VIDEOTAPE)SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR: And today, a word of clemency from the Department of Justice with regard to many drug offenders already in jail, let's talk about it with our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Welcome, everyone. Steve, what do you make of this, because there's been bipartisan support? There have been conservatives who have supported these efforts as well, saying it's a good idea. Our jails are overcrowded. Let's use some common sense.STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I guess this is what struck me as sort of curious about this move, and it speaks to the last comment that we heard â the last soundbite that we heard. The president seems intent on doing unilaterally what there appears to be growing support for doing legislatively. But he's choosing to do it unilaterally. I don't actually have any problem necessarily with the substance of what he is doing -- with the policy of what he's doing. I think most people on the left and right agree that there need to be some sentencing reforms. The question is how to do them, how to sequence it, and shouldn't we be doing this legislatively.You had Dick Durbin and Mike Lee in the Senate introduce the smarter sentencing act which doesn't lift mandatory minimum sentences but allows for some escapes or some exceptions and gives judges some discretion on what they will do sort of on a case by case basis. And you had scholars at the conservative Heritage Foundation making similar arguments and similarly legal scholars on the left making those arguments.I guess what I don't understand is why President Obama is choosing to sort of ignore all of that, to build on that growing consensus and actually lead as opposed to just doing what might be easier. But, you know, I think, to speak to FBI Director Coles comments that these kinds of older, more stringent sentences can erode the rule of law, you can make the argument that in a sense doing this the way the president is doing this by taking sentences that have already been imposed and in effect saying never mind also could have the same effect.BREAM: Charles is already nodding over here. Chomping at the bits.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Actually, Steve is entirely right, so I endorse everything he said, although â(CROSSTALK)BREAM: The seal of approval. The Krauthammer seal of approval.KRAUTHAMMER: It was slightly understated. This is lawlessness. If it were just this along, you would say, yes, on the merits that's not a bad idea. There was over-sentencing in the past. But we know what he's done with immigration reform where he unilaterally has enacted the Dream Act which the Congress had rejected, which you are not supposed to do. The Constitution is very, very specific. Legislation comes from Congress. It doesn't come from the White House. Why can't the president obey the Constitution, execute the laws faithfully, and let Congress change them, which is what he ought to be doing?Now, on the substance I think it's not a bad idea, but there is one thing we ought to consider. Many of these people who end up with sentences like these have plea bargained. So they really should have gotten much tougher stuff. They could have been a dealer, but in order to get a prosecution, they would get an admission that the person either used or was small time or wasn't involved in a gang or what, so you've got people who may be pretty bad apples in this crop that you want to be extremely careful about releasing. Yes, some of them were over-sentenced but I'm hope this is not going to be a mass clemency done for political reasons and for show reasons.BREAM: Well, let's talk about the convicts who are going to have to meet these six requirements. Carl Cameron reported on this tonight. This is the criteria that they are going to have to meet if they are going to qualify to then apply for clemency, serving a sentence under the old law greater than what they would get today, if they are convicted of nonviolent crimes, no links to organize the crime, served at least 10 years of their sentence, no other significant criminal history, good prison records and no history of violent. A.B., is that good enough for you?A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE HILL: I think if they follow through on that criteria and they scrutinize the applicants, because they have to apply for this, it sounds like it is not controversial and it's reasonable that if they have a good record, they are nonviolent, they never were involved with any gangs, they have had a good prison record, and they have served 10 years, that that's reasonable.President Obama is no longer in interested in waiting for Congress to act for anything. Whether there is bipartisan support building or not, he's obviously made it clear that he wants to speak to his supporters, perhaps galvanize them to turn out in the midterm elections on issues that are important to them and he's going to go it alone no matter what. So that's not really new and surprising. I don't think if they uphold these -- the strict criteria and this process that it will lead to anything dangerous or controversial.KRAUTHAMMER: Obama may not be interested in working with Congress, but the Constitution requires him --STODDARD: I know it's his job. I'm just saying this is one of a long string --KRAUTHAMMER: It's not just he's negligent in executing his job. He's being unconstitutional, and if it's becoming a habit, which it's becoming, and that's the problem, it's going to establish a principle that a Republican will come into office and he will say I campaigned against capital gains taxes so I'm going to order the FBI not to collect it.  That's not -- if that were to happen, you could be sure that the liberals would be screaming about --STODDARD: Of course.KRAUTHAMMER: But that's the point. This is eroding the rule of law in a systemic way time after time.BREAM: And a lot of people think that's the foundation of liberty and freedom is the rule of law and the ability of citizens to rely on that. It's something that President Obama talked about when he was campaigning. He said one of the primary things he was going to do was to rein in this over use of executive power. But Steve, we've mentioned many things that people feel like with regard to prosecutorial discretion, with not deporting, and there's a big debate over what their deportation number really do and don't mean, there is this ongoing conversation with those who even supported the president through both of his campaigns saying now they feel like it does set a dangerous precedent.HAYES: But he's all over the place on this. Even if the president were consistently abusing the law, which I think he is mostly in the domestic field, he's not consistent overseas. He's not consistent with respect to powers that I think the executive probably does have. Remember, the one time he decided to go to Congress was when he went to Congress on Syria so that they could constrain him to keep him from doing what he had already pledged to do. So why is Congress important in that context but something to disregard in all of these other contexts?BREAM: Well, and there is a lot of criticism being levied at the Hill as well, saying people can complain all day about this overuse of executive power and they have held hearings, and there's compelling testimony. But, A.B., a lot of people are pointing to folks on the Hill saying why aren't you doing anything about it? What can be done?STODDARD: Look, if you examine how many legislative days are left, it's about 54. But there are not even going to legislate on all those days before they take off for an active midterm campaign, there is no plans to tackle anything. House Speaker Boehner said last week to some supporters privately he's hell bent on doing immigration reform. You can ask anyone who is involved in the process, they said they couldn't even pass a rule. It's entirely impossible. There will be no big debates or small in Congress this year.  And so no matter how much bipartisan support there is for something that sounds very reasonable, that would actually make both parties, I think, look good, they are doing nothing this year.BREAM: Final word on this, Charles?KRAUTHAMMER: I think it's all been said rather --BREAM: And with the Krauthammer seal of approval.KRAUTHAMMER: I do think there's going to be a day when Democrats will rue the day that they did not at one point, any point on immigration, on sentencing, on any of the things Obama has done unilaterally, simply stand up and say it ought not be done this way. And it's a precedent that's going to haunt us in the future.BREAM: And we'll see how they feel about invoking the nuclear option in the Senate as well, something else that we'll see how it turns about possibly.KRAUTHAMMER: If it's nuclear, I'm in favor.BREAM: OK. With that, next up, the president is in Asia trying to calm anxious allies.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

All-Star Panel: Setting the stage for a Bush vs. Clinton rematch? This is a rush transcript from "Special Report," April 7, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   FORMER GOV. JEB BUSH, R - FL: And it turns out that not running has generated more interest than if I said I was running. It's kind of weird. I'm not that smart. I promise you it wasn't -- it just kind of happened that way. And so I go about my business each day trying to avoid having to think about it. I've got a lot of work to do, and I have a fulfilled life, and at some point, pretty -- you know, maybe a year from now --SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Marking it down.BUSH: End of the year I'll make a decision.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Former governor of Florida Jeb Bush talking to our own Shannon Bream over the weekend about his plans and whether he will decide -- when he will decide, he said by the end of year, about running for president.Take a look at the latest polls, the Real Clear Politics average in the GOP, and you see, obviously this is very early, but you see that Rand Paul is up there, Mike Huckabee, and then Jeb Bush at 11.5 percent over Chris Christie.Take a listen to Governor Bush on the issue of immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: Yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's kind of a -- it's a -- it's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime that should be -- there should be a price paid, but it shouldn't be -- it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families. And the idea that we're not going to fix this but with comprehensive reform ends up trapping these people when they could make a great contribution for their own families but also for us.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Let's start off talking about Jeb Bush. Let's bring in our panel tonight, Jason Riley, editorial board member of The Wall Street Journal, Charles Lane, opinion writer for the Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Jason, your thoughts about Jeb Bush, and he's getting a lot of attention.JASON RILEY, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Sure. I think right now Jeb Bush is sort of Chris Christie without the bridge scandal. He's a moderate Republican who can raise a ton of money who's got some issues with the base of the party. And I don't think those issues are really the biggest variant, at least what I heard from that interview. What I heard from that interview and some say he doesn't want to get into the mud. And I think that more than any of the issues, immigration, or Common Core could be a bigger problem with regard to the base. I think they are looking for someone who wants to get into the mud. Remember, they were upset for McCain for not going after Jeremiah Wright. They were upset with Romney over the Bain attacks and him not pushing back much harder.I think the Republican â the conservative Republicans are looking for someone who is willing to fight, who wants a fight. And if Jeb Bush is saying I don't want to get in the mud, I want to keep it clean, I want to stay up here, I think they might see a whiff of elitism there, and that could be a big problem.BAIER: Well, here's how he phrases it, Chuck. Take a listen to this, optimistic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: I think we need to have that kind of optimistic sense again. But when we grew up, we were told that this was the greatest country on the face of the earth, and we believed it. And I think America needs to have that more hopeful, optimistic feeling again.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A lot of people say that might be just rosy talk. But he wants to, he says, run a campaign, if he runs it, in an optimistic way.CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER, WASHINGTON POST: Well, I'm sure it will start out optimistic and positive and bright. And then when the opponents start attacking him, it will get a little more negative. That's the way these things go.I think Jeb Bush is a very formidable candidate on paper, two-term governor of Florida. He did a lot of things to reform the state's teacher tenure system. Obviously, all the things Jason said are true. He's an establishment figure. He can raise a lot of money. And of course, he comes from a great political family.But when you really get into the actual Bush candidacy and this changed Republican Party, very different from what it was like when he was last governor, in I guess the end of 2006, 2007 -- I'm not sure it works. And you see right there in those poll numbers you show, he's right in the middle of the pack. He's not breaking out. He's not leading.BAIER: No one really is.LANE: But he's behind a guy like Rand Paul, and Rand Paul was not even a factor, as I say, the last time Jeb Bush sort of held office. If he ran, he would not be anointed. He would really have to work for this, and I think some of the things he said on immigration will not go down well in some of the early primary states like South Carolina and Iowa and indeed could come back to haunt him. As candid as he was being, those are not popular things to say in Republican primary.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: If he was feeling any optimism before that interview, I think it's gone away after the interview. And I don't think it's a matter of fire in the belly and will he be tough enough or mean enough on the Democrats. That statement he made about illegal immigrants being an act of love is kind of bizarre. I grant him the complete sincerity and honesty of his view. He's always had that kind of approach, but that's leading with your chin.After all, there are millions of people around the world equally compassionate about the future of their children who are waiting patiently and legally in line and who love their children no less, and yet there is supposed to be this special compassion for those who jump the fence and break the law. Secondly, there's a question of if it were just one person and your opinion about it, or one family who jumped the fence, it wouldn't be a national issue, but it's 11 million. And then it becomes a national issue, an issue of sovereignty, and the president has to make a statement that an elementary principle of sovereignty is we control who comes into the country. I believe in immigration, but I believe that we set the parameters and the criteria for who gets in, and not to blithely say, well, you know, a lot of people want to get in and that should be a good thing. If we're ever going to have a solution to the immigration problem, and I believe in legalization, it will only happen when a Republican stands up and says, yes, we will legalize, but we're not going to get swindled like Reagan in '86 with a promise of closing the borders. You close the border, you prevent the compassionate parents who want to better the lives of their children but who want to jump the fence, and then you legalize the 11 million who are here.    BAIER: So getting in, does he get in?KRAUTHAMMER: I think there will be a reaction against this particular issue. I think he will, but I don't' think he's going to be as well received as he hopes.BAIER: Quickly, I want to go down the row, as you take a look at the latest polls about the Democratic Party race and Hillary Clinton where she stands over potential rivals. Obviously, Elizabeth Warren has said she's not going to run. But the sitting vice president sits at about 12 percent, Jason. There's a number of piece that the field in the Democratic side is essentially on hold waiting for this decision.RILEY: And the longer she waits to make up her mind the more she hurts her party if she doesn't run because it's difficult for people to raise money, and that's what is generally done this time in the cycle, people out there trying to raise money, but it's hard to get money out of donors if people know or think that Hillary might be running. I think her rivals are hoping, make up your mind, either get in or get out and let us get on with things, because the longer she keeps things in flux here the more damage she's doing to her party.BAIER: A lot of speeches in a short time.LANE: Yeah well, that's how you make money when you're out of office these days. I almost had a feeling reading some of these stories where people are saying we're all frozen until you make your decision. They all seem to be sourced to Democrats as if these Democrats are trying to push her. It's all the hope they have is that they can somehow push here into declaring her intentions. One of our guys who is pushing hardest is our Governor O'Malley here in Maryland. And he's been turned down by fundraisers for that very reason.KRAUTHAMMER: In the absence of a medical issue that's a major issue, she will run. The Clintons have a biological need to run and to govern. And unless there's a biological obstacle, she runs.BAIER: Next up, arguments over a congressional report on torture and outrage over the word "emotional."Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.

All-Star Panel: Speaker of the House pulls the plug on immigration reform? This is a rush transcript from "Special Report," February 6, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R â OH, HOUSE SPEAKER: There is widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.HARRY REID, D â NV, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Last week, at their retreat, they outlined a principle of immigration. Well, I guess today they decided they have no principles that relates to immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: Senate majority leader Harry Reid enjoying the dramatic change in direction today from the House Speaker John Boehner on the subject of immigration reform. And we're back now with the panel. Well, last week House Republican leaders had their caucus and they released a set of standards for comprehensive immigration reform. Today, as you heard, House Speaker John Boehner said it would be difficult to push any immigration reform this year. George, what happened?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I think they are rethinking the whole idea of "comprehensive." We are waste deep in the big muddy of comprehensive health care reform. And now they want to do comprehensive immigration reform. And I will show you what it looks like. That big boy is the Senate immigration bill. It's 1,197 pages long because it answers every conceivable question. It tells you what should be the hourly wage of an immigrant animal sorter in 2016 -- $9.84 if you are wondering about it. You know, everything.This is how we used to do things. This is the Homestead Act of 1862, settled the American West. It was immigration bill. It was designed to attract immigrants. To be fair, the copy and the parchment copy in the archives is four pages long, but still 1,193 pages shorter than this one. We don't do comprehensive well. We can break it up into little bits, but don't do more comprehensive.WALLACE: Now, it's interesting. Speaker Boehner said today, that given President Obama's selective enforcement, and I think that certainly is true of the rules in ObamaCare, that he and other Republicans don't trust the president in terms of enforcing both the borders as well as a path to legalization. Juan, do you think that's what's really going on here?JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: No. I mean, it's such a cover story. I mean, it's incredible. I mean, obviously, a week or so ago, John Boehner thought that he was able to lead his troops towards an immigration deal that was going to be acceptable, doing it piecemeal and getting that through the House in part, and then forcing the Senate to negotiate, and had the Senate and had the Democrats waiting, saying, you know what, the president is not going to get involved. We don't want to screw up what John Boehner is trying to put together.What you have now is a situation where Boehner all of sudden says, you know what, we can't trust President Obama. But, gee, isn't President Obama the one who is deporting so many Hispanics at a cost to his political stature with the Hispanic community? There is a real anger in the Hispanic community at the fact that he deports a record, historic number of people. Two-thirds of the American people support immigration reform. What you have seen today is Boehner  -- who was, after the last shutdown, angry and able to speak out against Heritage Action and all the rest -- caving to the talk radio crowd that sank immigration reform under George Bush. That's what's going on.WALLACE: The fact is, Charles, that after Boehner released and the Republican leaders released this set of standards for -- it was going to be piecemeal but it was going to add up to a comprehensive immigration reform, that there were a lot of Republicans who said that no matter what he called it, it was still amnesty and that it was crazy to bring up an issue that divided Republicans right in the middle of an election that they look like they are going to do pretty well in.CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, it was one of those rare, dawning of sanity among Republicans. The principles, I think, are really good, and I would agree with almost all of them -- border enforcement and then legalization, but not amnesty.But, the tactics that they have settled on today are exactly right. The point is that this is something you need to wait for next year for several reasons. A, it would fracture the Republicans in a year that will be all of theirs, all theirs, if they concentrate on the one issue, which is dividing the country, extremely unpopular, and is the embodiment of Obama liberalism, namely ObamaCare. You don't want to introduce a distraction.Second, you want immigration reform -- and to concentrate now on winning the Senate. Therefore, second, if you win the Senate and do you this next year, you're in a position to actually pass a bill which would be infinitely better than anything you could get today.And then, third, the Republicans are absolutely right to say that if you cannot trust the president to carry out the law faithfully. And he hasn't even carried out faithfully his own law, which he's amended 16 times and he is now going to continue to amend unilaterally and lawlessly, how do you expect him to carry out faithfully a law in which he is going to have to compromise on enforcement? So it's absolutely right. Not this year. Work on health care reform, win the Senate, and do it next year.WILLIAMS: Isn't it the case that he has deported a record number of people, and don't you think there is a risk to the party of energizing the Hispanic vote?WALLACE: You have five seconds to answer that.KRAUTHAMMER: Deportation is irrelevant. The question is --WILLIAMS: When he enforces the law it is irrelevant.KRAUTHAMMER: Would he enforce the border. There isn't a single indication that he would.WALLACE: And that's it for the panel. But stay tuned to find out why preparations for the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi are still such a mess.Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

American farmers confront 'big data' revolution March 19, 2014: A farmer pulls a disc harrow in a field near Tonganoxie , Kan.APWICHITA, Kan. –  Farmers from across the nation gathered in Washington this month for what has become an annual trek to seek action on the most important matters in American agriculture, such as immigration reform and water regulations.But this time, a new, more shadowy issue also emerged: growing unease about how the largest seed companies are gathering vast amount of data from sensors on tractors, combines and other farm equipment.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe increasingly common sensors measure soil conditions, seeding rates, crop yields and many other variables, allowing companies to provide farmers with customized guidance on how to get the most out of their fields.The involvement of the American Farm Bureau, the nation's largest and most prominent farming organization, illustrates how agriculture is cautiously entering a new era in which raw planting data holds both the promise of higher yields and the peril that the information could be hacked or exploited by corporations or government agencies.Seed companies want to harness the data to help farmers grow more food with the same amount of land, and the industry's biggest brands have offered assurances that all information will be closely guarded.But farmers are serving notice in Washington that the federal government might need to become involved in yet another debate over electronic security and privacy. Some members of Congress from rural states such as Kansas were already aware of the concerns, although the issue is new to many urban lawmakers.Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Kansas Republican who grew up on a dairy farm, said agriculture must achieve technological advances to keep up with population growth, which is expected to require 60 percent more food by 2050. But she has heard farmers' concerns about data collection."Information and data utilization is the way of the future," Jenkins said in an emailed statement. "And just as our federal government struggles with privacy concerns through records at the NSA and various health records, so too must we maintain appropriate privacy protection of individuals from corporate entitles."The Farm Bureau isn't sure what it needs from Washington, or whether action is even warranted yet. But farmers want their elected officials to be aware of how the industry is changing.This year's trip to Washington was primarily "an educational effort" to make sure members of Congress know about the data collecting and understand "the implications of the issue for our farmers and ranchers," Steve Baccus, an Ottawa County farmer and president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. "We may need to come back at some time in the future and talk to them about legislation."Farmers worry that a hedge fund or large company with access to "real-time" yield data from hundreds of combines at harvest time might be able to use that information to speculate in commodities markets long before the government issues crop-production estimates.Others are concerned that GPS-linked farm data could be obtained by the Environmental Protection Agency, antagonistic environmental groups or, in the Farm Bureau's words, "an overall-clad Edward Snowden," a reference to the former National Security Agency analyst who disclosed intelligence-gathering operations."It is not like we don't all trust them," Mark Nelson, director of commodities for the Kansas Farm Bureau, said of agribusiness companies. The new data-collection systems deliver "a lot of good things" to producers. "But as an organization we are looking at, `What is the big picture?"'The Farm Bureau Federation put together a "privacy expectation guide" to educate its members and recently drafted a policy asserting that data should remain the farmer's property. The bureau also opposes allowing any federal agency to serve as a clearinghouse for proprietary or aggregated data collected by private companies.Agribusiness giant Monsanto and other corporations have tried to allay fears by reassuring farmers their data is secure and will not be used beyond providing services farmers request.This season, growers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota can even buy for the first time a Monsanto "prescription" that offers a precise seeding recipe tailored to their soil type, disease history and pests.The St. Louis-based company, which has dominated the bioengineered seed business for more than a decade, expects to expand its prescription services to other states. It calls the advancements the "Green Data Revolution" -- a play off the so-called Green Revolution of the 20th century in which mechanical, chemical and biological advancements drove unprecedented increases in food production.Monsanto expects the use of ag data to offer comparable improvements in the next few years. It bought Precision Planting, a high-tech farm equipment maker, in 2012, followed last October by the purchase of the Climate Corporation, a data-analytics firm that provides weather-related farm services and crop insurance and is handling Monsanto's fledgling data-related services.The Green Data Revolution will help farmers make more profit per acre, said Dave Friedberg, chief executive officer of The Climate Corporation. The average farmer, he says, won't have to be "tech savvy.""Tech will just become integral to the work that they do ... in the same way that more than 100 years ago, we adopted machine-based farming equipment as the standard in the industry," Friedberg said.Companies are also pushing an Open Ag Data Alliance, which would set uniform data standards and allow systems built by different manufacturers to talk to one another.Farm equipment manufacturer John Deere has partnered with DuPont Pioneer to tout what it calls "Decision Services," a system in which farmers upload data onto servers that respond by sending seed and fertilizer prescriptions directly to Deere tractors in the field. Other companies offer services that let farmers connect a tablet computer to the seed monitor in the cab and download the information.Farm groups are conflicted about what role, if any, government should have in regulating data-gathering practices."We don't believe ultimately there is a legislative fix for this," said Terry Holdren, chief executive officer and general counsel for the Kansas Farm Bureau. "It is a contractual model for folks who have technology and folks who want technology."Nick Guetterman, who farms roughly 10,000 acres of corn and wheat with his father and three brothers in eastern Kansas, already uses GPS technology and has been considering sending all his data to a specialized service. But he still has reservations about what a seed company or an equipment manufacturer will do with it."I have not found it on my farm beneficial enough to pay them to analyze my data," Guetterman said. "I either analyze it myself or do nothing with it." 
Americans for Prosperity hits Landrieu with Iraq vet ObamaCare victim FILE: Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., at a health care conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.AP**Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

Mary Landrieu, D-La, in which Marine veteran Christopher Schiff blames her for the disruption of his family’s health insurance. The ad will hit airwaves in Louisiana this afternoon, and features only Schiff speaking to the camera from what appears to be his home.The script - “I did two tours in Iraq. Because of my service I was able to get a health care plan that worked for me. So I get a letter from my insurance company that said my insurance costs were going way up because of ObamaCare. And oh, by the way, you should be happy about it. Mary Landrieu said that ObamaCare is going to make things better. Better? Not for people like me. I don’t think Mary Landrieu is looking out for my best interests or the people in Louisiana.  Tell Mary Landrieu, ObamaCare is hurting Louisiana families.”[Landrieu Tuesday toWaPo: “This race will be won not on the president’s record, but on my record…The Affordable Care Act won’t be the centerpiece of my campaign. The centerpiece will be my leadership and ability to deliver for the people of my state, no matter who the president is.”]The Boonstra affect? - The ad is similar to a spot that premiered in February and helped upend the Michigan Senate race. That ad, featuring cancer patient Julie Boonstra attacking Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., for his support of the law, set off a firestorm. While Democrats attacked Boonstra and worked to make the Koch brothers into central figures, the spots seemed to have helped likely Republican Senate nominee Terri Lynn Land get into contention and maybe even pull into the lead. Americans for Prosperity is planning an even larger ad barrage against Landrieu, an entrenched incumbent who still leads Republican frontrunner Rep. Bill Cassidy in Pelican State polls.The background on Schiff’s claim from AFP - “Christopher had a plan from Assurant Health/Time Insurance Company backed by the USAA. Because of Obamacare, he lost the plan that he chose and liked. That plan was cancelled because of the affordable care act, and his monthly insurance premiums for a similar Obamacare compliant plan increased.”IRS COMPLAINS OF TIGHT BUDGETS, PAYS BIG BONUSES TO PROBLEM EMPLOYEESFox News: “IRS employees who had been disciplined for tax and conduct issues were nonetheless rewarded with monetary awards or time off, according to a watchdog report released Tuesday. The report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that while for the most part the reward program for IRS workers complied with federal regulations, employees who had themselves failed to pay their federal taxes and had discipline problems were also rewarded… The watchdog found that in the period from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012 over 2,800 employees who had been disciplined for conduct problems, including issues with federal tax compliance, had received over $2.8 million in monetary awards and over 27,000 hours in time-off awards.Heckuva job on that launch - Washington Examiner: “Despite controversial delays in Obamacare and costly problems with its healthcare.gov website, most officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were paid more last year than the year before, newly released data show. …The total cost of the CMS payroll data released to the Examiner increased to more than $76 million, compared to $69 million in 2012.”WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Like a good bottle of wine, research shows personalities get mellower with age. WSJ looks at why behavior traits naturally occur and how to deal with those slow changes. “From the ages of 20 to 65, people report increases in positive traits, such as conscientiousness, and decreases in negative traits, such as neuroticism. Most people tend to become more agreeable, more responsible, more emotionally stable—in other words, their personalities improve.”[Ed. note: We used to call it wisdom.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., answered calls from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and others on the left for increased gun control in the wake of an Easter Weekend outbreak of violence in the city that left eight dead and 44 wounded. Paul, in Chicago to promote his call for school choice for children in blighted neighborhoods, told Megyn Kelly that gun control efforts were misguided, citing a “sickness of spirit” as the cause. “There is also just a thuggishness that’s out of control that no longer knows right from wrong,” Paul said. “It’s something maybe beyond government. It's spiritual. People need to be taught right and wrong, there needs to be an influence in their lives and a police presence. It's not as simple as banning guns. They have tried in D.C. and Chicago and it hasn't worked.” Watch the interview from “The Kelly File.”Paul answers Dole on inexperience charge - Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is revisiting his old stomping grounds in Kansas, meeting with supporters, posing for pictures and showing that at 90 he’s still ready to hit the trail. Along the way, he’s again voicing criticism of the current condition of the Republican Party and chiding its potential 2016 field. Though he praised former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Dole told the Wichita Eagle “A number of the younger members, first-termers like Rand Paul, (Marco) Rubio and that extreme-right-wing guy - Ted Cruz? All running for president now. I don't think they've got enough experience yet.” Paul told reporters: “I absolutely disagree with that because I think in some ways, when you have people who are career politicians, they’ve been beaten down by the system and are so part of the system that they can't see all the problems of the system.”ROMNEY COMES TO MCDONNELL’S DEFENSEWaPo: “Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has made a personal donation of $10,000 to former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell's legal defense fund, a Romney aide confirmed Tuesday. McDonnell and his wife, [Maureen McDonnell], were indicted in January on federal charges of bribery and fraud involving their relationship with a prominent Virginia businessman and campaign donor. The McDonnells are scheduled to face trial in July.”TEA PARTY CANDIDATE SNAGS WIN IN FLORIDA RACEAP: “Curt Clawson has won a Republican primary in a special election that was called after the district's congressman resigned in January after being arrested for buying cocaine. With 96 percent of precincts counted, Clawson had 38 percent of the vote in Tuesday's four-way race, ahead of Lizbeth Benacquisto, who had 26 percent. Paige Kreegel had 25 percent and Michael Dreikorn had 11 percent. The 54-year-old former CEO of an aluminum wheel company will face Democrat April Freeman in the June 24 general election in the heavily Republican district, which includes parts of Lee and Collier counties. The winner will fill the seat left vacant by Trey Radel, who pleaded guilty to cocaine charges.

Former Reebok CEO David Perdue, the cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel and Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga. have emerged as frontrunners in the race, but don’t count out, Rep. Paul Broun or Rep. Phil Gingrey hoping to secure the conservative nomination. Which two will survive the May 20 primary and advance to the August runoff? Watch video here.CRUZ BACKS SASSENebraska senate contender Ben Sasse has won the backing of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The Midland University president is locked in a tight battle with former state Treasurer Shane Osborn in the Republican primary to fill the seat of retiring Sen. Mike Johanns,  From the Sasse campaign statement: “I have gotten to know Ben Sasse, and while Nebraskans have good choices, Ben is the strongest conservative voice running for United States Senate,” said Sen. Cruz.  “Ben will not be just another vote in the Senate – he will be a leader in the fight to stop the Obama agenda and repeal ObamaCare from day one.  We need strong reinforcements like him in the United States Senate.” Cruz will join Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska and former Gov. Kay Orr, R-Neb., to stump for Sasse in North Platte on Friday. The primary, already two weeks into early voting, is set for May 13.UDALL AD ATTACKS GARDNER ON ABORTIONIn a sure sign of trouble, Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., goes on the attack on abortion in in the first ad of his re-election bid. RCP: “[The] Colorado senator has gone straight for the negative in his opening spot, hitting his Republican opponent, Rep. Cory Gardner [R-Colo.], on his anti-abortion views and previous support for personhood legislation. Udall’s choice to run a negative ad early in the campaign may signal the difficult path ahead of him…the spot also highlights the Democrats’ strategy to retain seats in an unfavorable climate: characterize the opponent as extreme, especially when it comes to women’s health issues.”Gardner responds - KDVR: “Gardner’s campaign responded quickly, attacking Udall for going negative and alleging that the ad distorts Gardner’s record. ‘After nearly two decades in Washington, Senator Udall has decided to launch his reelection campaign with a negative, misleading attack ad because he has no record of accomplishments,” Gardner campaign manager Chris Hansen said in a statement.”[America Rising’s opposition research boss Joe Pounder observes that Udall once lamented those who would “divert attention to divisive social issues.”]NORTH CAROLINA SENATE GOP CANDIDATES DEBATERepublican North Carolina Senate hopeful Greg Brannon targeted frontrunner state House speaker Thom Tills Tuesday night in the first debate among the field of GOP contenders vying to challenge vulnerable Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. Brannon and Tillis jousted over immigration, ObamaCare and gun rights. In the exchange, Brannon tried to paint the state House speaker as weak, while Tillis sought to keep the focus on defeating Hagan.  Charlotte Observer reports, “Brannon cited the Constitution at least 15 times in the first dozen questions, while Tillis advocated a ‘practical conservatism’ that encouraged bipartisan cooperation.” The two will face off in the second debate tonight in Raleigh.

Those who resist their efforts to curb carbon emissions? Well, they’re like the defenders of slavery. “The leaders of slave power were fighting a movement of dispossession. The abolitionists told them that the property they owned must be forfeited, that all the wealth stored in the limbs and wombs of their property would be taken from them. Zeroed out.... [writer and activist Bill McKibben] leads us inexorably to the staggering conclusion that the work of the climate movement is to find a way to force the powers that be, from the government of Saudi Arabia to the board and shareholders of ExxonMobil, to leave 80 percent of the carbon they have claims on in the ground…” Hayes says that it is different in the sense that “Humans are humans; molecules are molecules” but says “the political economy of slavery and the political economy of fossil fuel” are alike.[Ed. note: If you ever wonder why climate change activists are so intolerant of dissent these days, now you know.

Americans Soften Strict Views On Immigration If They Engage With Immigrants, Commuter Study Finds The test went thusly: If train commuters suddenly were exposed to immigrants speaking a foreign language, how would they react?The answer, a Harvard professor’s experiment found, was that commuters developed stronger negative views of immigrants after a few initial days of consistent exposure, but the disapproving views leveled off over time.The study, which was conducted on various train platforms in the Boston metro area, consisted of Mexican immigrant men, mainly in their 20s, standing on nine platforms every day for more than a week, according to the Boston Globe.Initial surveys of the commuters, 85 percent of whom identified themselves as white, conducted after about three days of being around immigrants showed that respondents favored stricter policies regarding immigration, but then softened their stance, though they remained more firm in their views of how immigrant issues should be handled than they were before the experiment began.Author Ryan D. Enos saw the study as proof that the more exposed to those unlike themselves people are, the more people are likely to change their attitudes toward them, including in a positive way.“These things like public transit and the way we build our cities very much affect how we interact with people and how we get along as groups,” the Globe quoted Enos, assistant professor of government at Harvard and author of the study, as saying. “When we invest in infrastructure, we bring intergroup harmony by encouraging people to interact.”Enos said he decided the rare approach of conducting a study using rail commuters because of the difficulty of finding many real-world environments in which race relations can be observed over a period of time.“We’re probably not going to start randomly buying houses in a neighborhood and move people in,” Enos said, according to the Globe. “We wanted to use the infrastructure of a city to simulate changes that people would experience if they were exposed to different types of people in their day-to-day life. We thought, ‘Where in the world do we see that kind of routinized behavior?’"The immigrants reported to Enos what kind of reactions they received from commuters.“Because we are chatting in Spanish, they look at us,” wrote one of them wrote to Enos. “I don’t think it is common to hear people speaking in Spanish on this route.”Commuters received a survey to complete before and after the immigrants first arrived, and were given $5 gift cards for participating.After the first three days, the respondents expressed support for such government policies as making English the official language, and for strict immigration enforcement laws.“People’s attitudes moved sharply in this exclusionary direction,” Enos said. “I was surprised that the effects were strong.”Those positions grew less adamant after about 10 days but, the newspaper noted, they nonetheless remained stronger in favor of strict immigrant-related laws than were before the immigrants appeared on the rail platforms.“Regions predicted to become more diverse should expect initial conflict,” Enos said. “However, these results also suggest that more prolonged contact or interpersonal interaction can diminish initial exclusionary impulse.”Sam R. Sommers, a psychology professor at Tufts University, agreed.“The initial effects of diversity can be negative and tough,” Sommers said. “But, with time, negative effects on cohesion and morale begin to diminish, and diversity starts to become an asset.”One of the immigrants noted in his comments to Enos: “People have started to recognize and smile to us.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Amid Concerns About Immigrant Asylum Claims, Homeland Security Revises 'Credible Fear' Guidelines WASHINGTON (AP) –  The Homeland Security Department has reissued asylum rules to immigration officials amid concerns that they are misinterpreting how to decide which immigrants get to see a judge for asylum claims.The chief of the asylum division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has told asylum officers that immigrants who make a "credible fear" claim, the first step in the asylum process, must have a "significant possibility" of winning an asylum case before a judge.In a Feb. 28 memo, the official, John Lafferty, said in order to meet that standard immigrants have to "demonstrate a substantial and realistic possibility of succeeding in court."The memo, which updates an officer training course lesson plan, does not substantially change the standard for how the immigration agency handles such cases. The same language was used to describe the standard to win a full hearing before an immigration judge as far back as 2008, according to the USCIS website.Lafferty wrote that the there were concerns that the standard was not always being met in recent cases."In light of concerns that the application of the 'significant possibility' standard has lately been interpreted to require only a minimal or mere possibility of success, the revised (guidance) clearly states that a claim that has no possibility or only a minimal or mere possibility does not meet the ... standard," Lafferty wrote.Lafferty also said the revised guidance was issued because of a significant increase in the number of "credible fear" claims cases the agency was handling.In 2013, Lafferty wrote, USCIS handled more of these claims than from 2007 through 2011 combined. And the agency recorded a 250 percent increase in such cases from 2012 to 2013.The National Immigrant Youth Alliance, an immigrant advocacy group that has staged several protests along the border that have included young immigrants seeking asylum, released the memo to the news media Thursday. It was first reported on by the Los Angeles Times.Jeff Carter, a USCIS spokesman, said in a statement late Thursday that the government's rules for asylum seekers have not changed."The current training guidelines are to ensure proper implementation of the statutory standard that governs these screenings," Carter said.Republican lawmakers recently have voiced concern that the asylum system was being abused by immigrants who have little or no chance of winning asylum.In many cases, asylum seekers who are approved to have a judge hear their case are released from immigration detention and allowed to apply for a work permit while their cases are pending. In some cases, it could take years for an asylum case to reach a courtroom.Immigrants who ask for asylum at the border are subject to what the government has called "expedited removal," meaning they can be deported without seeing a judge if their initial "credible fear" claim is denied.While asylum requests from Mexican nationals and immigrants from Central America fleeing drug cartel and gang violence have spiked in recent years, the odds of winning asylum in the United States remain low.David Bennion, a lawyer who has worked with the immigrant youth alliance, said multiple asylum cases in San Diego recently have been denied since the memo was issued internally at USCIS. He described the denials as "retaliation" for the group's advocacy activities.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Amid Mixed Signals From GOP, President Obama Resists Demands That He Act Alone On Immigration WASHINGTON (AP) — For a president looking for a legacy piece of legislation, the current state of the immigration debate represents a high-wire act.President Barack Obama could act alone to slow deportations, and probably doom any chance of a permanent and comprehensive overhaul. Yet if he shows too much patience, the opportunity to fix immigration laws as he wants could well slip away.As Republican leaders dampen expectations for overhauling immigration laws this year, the White House is hoping that the GOP resistance is temporary and tactical, and Obama is resisting pressure from some political allies to take matters into his own hands and ease his administration's deportation record.House Speaker John Boehner this week all but ruled out passage of immigration legislation before the fall midterm elections, saying Republicans had trouble trusting that Obama would implement all aspects of an immigration law.White House officials say they believe Boehner ultimately wants to get it done. But they acknowledge that Boehner faces stiff resistance from conservatives who oppose any form of legalization for immigrants who have crossed into the United States illegally or overstayed their visas. As well, Republicans are eager to keep this election year's focus on Obama's health care law.Obama is willing to give Boehner space to operate and to tamp down the conservative outcry that greeted a set of immigration overhaul principles the speaker brought forward last week. For now, the White House is simply standing behind a comprehensive bill that passed in the Senate last year, but is not trying to press Boehner on how to proceed in the Republican-controlled House.Vice President Joe Biden told CNN that Obama is waiting to see what the House passes before responding.The White House view could be overly optimistic, playing down the strength of the opposition to acting this year.For Republicans the immigration issue poses two political challenges. In the short term, it displays intraparty divisions when they want to use their unified opposition to the health care law as a key issue in the 2014 elections. Immigration distracts from that strategy. But failure to pass an immigration overhaul would be a significant drag on the chances of a Republican winning the 2016 presidential election if angry Latino voters are mobilized to vote for the Democratic nominee.Making the case for a delay, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said there's "overwhelming support for doing nothing this year." Labrador, who worked with a small group of Republicans and Democrats on comprehensive legislation last year then abandoned the negotiations, said it would be a mistake to have an internal battle in the GOP. He argued for waiting until next year when the Republicans might have control of the Senate.Some Republican supporters of a new immigration law are pushing back."I'm trying to convince my colleagues that regardless of primaries, regardless of elections this November, that we have an obligation and a duty to solve this crisis once and for all," Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., told the Spanish-language television network Telemundo in an interview scheduled to air Sunday.White House spokesman Jay Carney did not criticize Boehner's talk of a delay, though he called the speaker's claims that Obama is the problem "an odd bit of diversion." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, however, did not hold back, signaling that Democrats are prepared to lay the blame on Boehner and his party if legislation does not materialize."Republicans should be candid about putting extremism ahead of the good of the country," she said.Democratic officials familiar with the White House thinking say there is also a possibility that the House could act in November or December, during a lame-duck session of Congress after the elections. That would require swift work in a short time. What's more, if Republicans win control of the Senate, there would be pressure to leave the issue to the new Senate.The longer the immigration issue remains unresolved, the more pressure will fall on Obama from immigrant advocates to act alone and ease the deportations that have been undertaken by his administration. Since Obama took office in January 2009, more than 1.9 million immigrants have been deported.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Anger Mounts As Hope Fades: Activists Push Obama To Act Unilaterally On Deportation, Immigration WASHINGTON (AP) –  Latinos and immigration activists are warning of political peril for President Barack Obama and Democrats in the fall election unless the president acts boldly and soon to curb deportations and allow more immigrants to remain legally in the U.S.Many activists say Obama has been slow to grasp the emotions building within the Latino community as deportations near the 2 million mark for his administration and hopes for immigration legislation fade. With House Republicans unlikely to act on an overhaul, executive action by Obama is increasingly the activists' only hope."There is tremendous anger among core constituencies of the president and the Latino and Asian communities in particular," said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, which champions immigration change. "He has a momentous choice to make."Activists credit their sit-ins and hunger strikes for Obama directing new Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review the administration's deportations policy and suggest ways to make it more humane. Now they're focused on ensuring they get the outcome they want — an expansion of Obama's two-year-old policy allowing work permits for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children who have been in school or the military.Despite the complaints from activists, Republicans accuse the Obama administration of inflating its record on deportations by counting people removed as they're attempting to cross the border or shortly thereafter. In the 2013 fiscal year more than 60 percent of the nearly 370,000 deportations were of recent border crossers, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The program has helped more than 600,000 people. Activists want it expanded to include more immigrants, such as those who have been in the U.S. for at least five years or who since their arrival have had children. Depending on how it's defined, that could help many millions more.Obama has said he doesn't have the authority to take such a step without Congress. At a White House meeting with religious leaders Tuesday he emphasized he wouldn't act on his own while there still was a window for congressional action, participants said.Republicans have warned that a unilateral move by Obama would end any possibility for cooperation on immigration legislation. A bill to improve border security and offer a path to citizenship for many of the 11.5 million immigrants here illegally remains stalled in the GOP-led House 10 months after passing the Senate.But many activists say they've all but given up on Republicans and argue that Obama has the responsibility and authority to take expansive steps to legalize large segments of the population. They worry that Johnson's review will produce only small measures aimed at slowing deportations and improving procedures."At this point anything short of an affirmative administrative relief program for parents of U.S. citizens and Dreamers is not enough," said Lorella Praeli, director of advocacy at United We Dream, which represents immigrants brought here illegally as kids, known by their supporters as Dreamers. "The clock on Obama has run out."Administration officials haven't tipped their hand on the timing or outcome of Johnson's review, though activists anticipate initial steps fairly soon. Peter Boogaard, spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said the review will be completed expeditiously and the aim is to see "if there are areas where we can further align our enforcement policies with our goal of sound law enforcement practice."Despite the complaints from activists, Republicans accuse the Obama administration of inflating its record on deportations by counting people removed as they're attempting to cross the border or shortly thereafter. In the 2013 fiscal year more than 60 percent of the nearly 370,000 deportations were of recent border crossers, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Immigration activists, meanwhile, say they feel betrayed by Obama, who was elected with strong Latino and Asian support in 2008. They complain his strategy of winning GOP cooperation by increasing enforcement has failed.Cynthia Díaz, 18, participated in a six-day hunger strike outside the White House last week to protest her mother's detention. She pointed to Obama's promise to prioritize immigration reform."That's how he got the Latino vote, and now he just stabbed us in the back," Díaz said, adding she and others would think twice in the future before supporting the president and his party.Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said recent polling shows a drop-off in enthusiasm among Latino voters. "Lack of progress on immigration is hurting our chances of getting these voters out to vote," Lake saidImmigrants' rights leaders say executive action by the president would energize Latino and Asian voters, as happened before the 2012 election when Obama deferred deportations for young immigrants. However, it also could mobilize conservative voters.Frustration has spilled over onto some of Obama's allies in Congress. Protesters from California were arrested last week after swarming the offices of Democratic Reps. Loretta Sanchez and Xavier Becerra to push toward stronger action."We're doing everything that we can," Sanchez later complained. "So when they come and they pressure us it's almost like, 'Guys, we understand where you're coming from, but what we need to do is we need to get a vote out of" House Speaker John Boehner. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said activists were giving "a gift to the Republicans" by targeting Obama instead of the GOP.Obama expressed a similar complaint at a meeting with immigration rights groups last month, asking officials present to give him 90 more days and meantime keep the focus on the GOP. Participants portrayed a president getting drawn reluctantly into contemplating executive action and focused, at least initially, on smaller steps that he told them would likely not satisfy them.That meeting, and Obama's announcement of a review by Johnson, came shortly after Janet Murguia, head of the National Council of La Raza, labeled Obama "deporter in chief."Now activists are waiting for Obama's next step."The pressure for sure is working, and I think the question is how bold are they ready to go," said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. "The hard part is this is not a bold administration, and especially on immigration where the focus has been on legislation."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Another Democrat suggests racism within GOP, drawing another sharp response In this Sept. 3, 2013 file photo, Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y. is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington.AP/FileNew York Rep. Steve Israel said Sunday a significant part of the Republican Party is “animated by racism,” marking the third time in recent days that a leading Democrat has appeared to make race an issue and drawn a sharp response from Republicans.Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, whose major role is the get his House members re-elected, told CNN’s “State of the Union” that not all of his Republican colleagues are racist.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“Not all of them, of course not,” he said. “But to a significant extent, the Republican base does have elements that are animated by racism.”Israel made his comments after Attorney General Eric Holder testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, then suggested the next day at a forum on civil rights that the past five years in Washington have been marked by "unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.""If you don't believe that … you look at the way the attorney general of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee," Holder continued.The comment drew a sharp response from House Speaker John Boehner, who on Thursday told reporters: “There's no issue of race here. The frustration is that the American people have not been told the truth about what happened at the IRS.“The American people have not been told the truth about what happened in Fast and Furious. The administration has not told the American people the truth about Benghazi. We've been going through all of these hearings, having to hold people in contempt because they've made it impossible to get to the documents. They have not been forthcoming.”On Sunday, Washington Republicans suggested Democrats, at risk in November of losing more House seats and their control of the Senate, in large part over problems with ObamaCare, are trying to change the topic of public discussion.“Dems are desperate to try to discredit conservatives because they don’t have the facts on their side,” the Republican National Committee said in a statement. “Holder tried to play the same racism card. … This must be the Dems’ latest strategy to distract from ObamaCare. Like their previous attempts, though, this one won’t work either.”On Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared to suggest race is playing a part in why congressional Republicans do not want to act on comprehensive immigration reform.“I think race has something to do with the fact that they’re not bringing up an immigration bill,” the California Democrat said. “I’ve heard them say to the Irish, ‘If it were just you, this would be easy.’ ”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Graham Hughes)The Associated PressMONTREAL –  The Liberal Party won Quebec's legislative elections Monday, in a crushing defeat for the main separatist party and major setback for the cause of independence in the French-speaking province.The results will allow the Liberals, staunch supporters of Canadian unity, to form a majority government, less than 18 months after voters had booted the party from power for the first time in nine years amid allegations of corruption.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTWith 99 percent of the polling stations reporting, the Liberals had 41.4 percent of the vote and took 70 of the National Assembly's 125 seats.The separatist Parti Quebecois had 25.4 percent, and was on track to win 30 seats. The Coalition for Quebec's Future, which downplayed the sovereignty issue to focus on the economy, was close behind with 23.3 percent and 22 seats.Quebec Premier Pauline Marois, who led a minority government, called the snap elections last month in hopes of securing a majority for her PQ party. But the campaign stirred up speculation that a PQ majority would ultimately lead to another referendum on independence from Canada, an idea that has lacked support in recent years.Fears of a referendum galvanized supporters of the Liberals. Marois suffered a humiliating defeat, even losing her own district seat, and announced that she would step down as party leader."The defeat of our party tonight makes me sad," Marois told supporters. "I am leaving my post."Marois had tried to mute talk of another referendum on independence. She had hoped instead to make the election about the PQ's proposed "charter of values," a controversial but popular law that would ban public employees from wearing Muslim headscarves and other overt religious symbols.But the strategy backfired early in the campaign when one PQ candidate, multi-millionaire media baron Pierre Karl Peladeau, burst onto the scene with a fist-pumping declaration of his commitment to "make Quebec a country."Peladeau, who won his district, congratulated Liberal leader and new premier Philippe Couillard.Couillard, a former brain surgeon and ex-Liberal health minister, has vowed to return the Canadian flag to the legislature. The PQ has always removed the flag when elected."My dear friends the division is over. Reconciliation has arrived," Couillard told supporters at his victory rally.With the PQ out, it means Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper won't have to worry about a national unity crisis as he heads toward the 2015 federal election.Harper said the results "clearly demonstrate that Quebeckers have rejected the idea of a referendum and want a government that will be focused on the economy and job creation."Quebec has had two referendums on sovereignty. The last such vote, in 1995, narrowly rejected independence.Quebec, which is 80 percent of French-speaking, has plenty of autonomy already. The province of 8.1 million sets its own income tax, has its own immigration policy favoring French speakers, and has legislation prioritizing French over English.But many Quebecois have long dreamed of an independent Quebec, as they at times haven't felt respected and have worried about the survival of their language in English-speaking North America.John Zucchi, a professor of history at Montreal's McGill University, said the PQ defeat is a serious blow to the separatist movement."I think separatism is going to go on the backburner for quite a while, perhaps a generation," he said. "In these difficult times the people of Quebec have to face many serious issues regarding work, the economy, regarding an uncertain future and they know that separatism is not the magic solution."The election outcome is also likely to bury the PQ's hopes of passing the charter of values, which the Liberals oppose.Marois had hoped that the proposed law would electrify French-speaking voters in swing regions, where many feel the bill aims to preserve Quebec's fundamental values, including the equality of men and women and the separation of church and state.The law would forbid government employees from wearing Muslim headscarves, Jewish yarmulkes, Sikh turbans and larger-than-average crucifixes. It would also prohibit citizens from covering their faces while receiving public services, such as applying for driver's licenses, for the purpose of identification.Protests against the proposal have drawn thousands of Muslims, Sikhs and Jews to Montreal's streets to denounce what they call an affront on religious freedom.Pierre Martin, a political science professor at the University of Montreal, said the charter is just not a priority for the Quebecois."This issue was actually very low on the priorities of Quebec voters. It was actually a very weak issue for the Parti Quebecois to campaign on," Martin said.Federal Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau applauded the Quebecois for saying no to the charter."I had the utmost confidence that Quebec voters would reject the negative, divisive politics of Ms. Marois' proposed plan," Trudeau said in a statement. "I am proud that my fellow Quebeckers have chosen unity and acceptance as we move forward together."The provincial Liberal party of Quebec was previously haunted by allegations of corruption that tainted their nine years in power. But Couillard hammered away at the referendum issue and framed the election as a choice between uncertainty and stability.Marois became Quebec's first female premier in Quebec's last election in September 2012, but her victory rally was marred by a deadly shooting.A man opened fire outside the Montreal theater where the rally was being held, killing a stage hand and wounding another. The masked gunman, wearing a bathrobe, was shown on television ranting and shouting "The English are waking up!" in French as police dragged him away. Richard Henry Bain has been charged with first-degree murder and is awaiting trial.____Gillies contributed to this report from Toronto.

But Arizona's leaders are logging lots of miles to put a new face on their home state.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTOfficial delegations have come across the border several times in the last year looking to drum up more trade and tourism in what is already a big business relationship — but one they say could be much bigger. They're talking binational everything: companies with headquarters in Phoenix and factories in Mexico, wine tours that visit both sides of the border, even the first Super Bowl with Mexican sponsorship when Phoenix hosts the mega-sports event next year."We're just like you are," said Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin, who voted for Arizona's controversial law. He was speaking to a binational cocktail party in Mexico City this week, saying Mexicans and Arizonans want the same future for their children: "We'll be here a lot more frequently, and we're here to continue to make friends.""Friends" was the furthest term from mind in 2010, when the Arizona legislature made it a state crime to fail to get or carry immigration registration papers — a provision that was later thrown out by the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices upheld the law's provision that police, while investigating other crimes, are required to question people's immigration status if they're believed to be in the country illegally.Drawing cries of racial profiling, the law sparked international protests and calls for boycotts of Arizona. It was loudly condemned by then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and U.S. President Barack Obama called it misguided.Though it was largely gutted, the impact on the state's image was lasting."Arizona has a stigma, just like Ciudad Juarez has a stigma," said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a Mexican academic and government adviser, referring to the Mexican border city known worldwide for drug-related violence, even though its homicide rate has dropped.Tobin, who was leading his second delegation in six months and plans to be back in June, said he supported the legislation because "we were in a crisis mode."What changed? The global economy.Arizona emerged from severe recession and recognized it sits next to a country that has lured manufacturing back from Asia, is aggressively seeking foreign investment and plans to open its rich oil sector to the rest of the world. Not only that, Texas and California were already far ahead in boosting economic ties with the "new Brazil."Other state delegations arrive regularly, with Utah coming in April and Massachusetts' governor stopping in Mexico City at the same time as the Arizona delegation."We have changed our economic policies and now we can show on paper that any investor here in Mexico City ... will find Arizona is a better investment than Los Angeles or Austin," Tobin said.But the political climate has to go along with that, Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said, noting the immigrant law known as Senate Bill 1070 "gets brought up regularly" on his missions to Mexico."My message is that 1070 doesn't reflect the values of the people of Phoenix," said Stanton, who wants to double his city's exports to Mexico in the next five years. "Mexico in the next 20 to 30 years is going to be one of the top economies in the world, passing up Brazil. If we don't get this right now, we're going to miss out on a massive opportunity."Mexicans are already Arizona's biggest foreign trade partners, with the state exporting $7 billion worth of goods last year, the U.S. Commerce Department says. But that's way behind Texas at $100 billion and California at $24 billion.Mexican visitors to Arizona spend an average of $7 million a day, according to the Arizona-Mexico Commission, a nonprofit group that promotes economic ties.Members of the Arizona delegation were quick to note that state Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the immigrant legislation, has since been voted out of office.David Farca of the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, who came on the trade mission, said the anti-immigrant law was never implemented as written, but that wasn't widely noticed."There's a complete misconception about that," he said. "On the other hand, there's a perception from Arizona that if you come to Mexico City, you're going to get kidnapped. Yet here we are. So perception is not everything."___Associated Press writer Josh Hoffner in Phoenix contributed to this report.

It was loudly condemned by then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and U.S. President Barack Obama called it misguided.Though it was largely gutted, the impact on the state's image was lasting."Arizona has a stigma, just like Ciudad Juarez has a stigma," said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a Mexican academic and government adviser, referring to the Mexican border city known worldwide for drug-related violence, even though its homicide rate has dropped.Tobin, who was leading his second delegation in six months and plans to be back in June, said he supported the legislation because "we were in a crisis mode."What changed? The global economy.Arizona emerged from severe recession and recognized it sits next to a country that has lured manufacturing back from Asia, is aggressively seeking foreign investment and plans to open its rich oil sector to the rest of the world. Not only that, Texas and California were already far ahead in boosting economic ties with the "new Brazil."Other state delegations arrive regularly, with Utah coming in April and Massachusetts' governor stopping in Mexico City at the same time as the Arizona delegation."We have changed our economic policies and now we can show on paper that any investor here in Mexico City ... will find Arizona is a better investment than Los Angeles or Austin," Tobin said.But the political climate has to go along with that, Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said, noting the immigrant law known as Senate Bill 1070 "gets brought up regularly" on his missions to Mexico."My message is that 1070 doesn't reflect the values of the people of Phoenix," said Stanton, who wants to double his city's exports to Mexico in the next five years. "Mexico in the next 20 to 30 years is going to be one of the top economies in the world, passing up Brazil. If we don't get this right now, we're going to miss out on a massive opportunity."Mexicans are already Arizona's biggest foreign trade partners, with the state exporting $7 billion worth of goods last year, the U.S. Commerce Department says. But that's way behind Texas at $100 billion and California at $24 billion.Mexican visitors to Arizona spend an average of $7 million a day, according to the Arizona-Mexico Commission, a nonprofit group that promotes economic ties.Members of the Arizona delegation were quick to note that state Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the immigrant legislation, has since been voted out of office.David Farca of the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, who came on the trade mission, said the anti-immigrant law was never implemented as written, but that wasn't widely noticed."There's a complete misconception about that," he said. "On the other hand, there's a perception from Arizona that if you come to Mexico City, you're going to get kidnapped. Yet here we are. So perception is not everything."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
As Immigration Reform Sputters, Activists Begin Focusing On Stopping Deportations DENVER (AP) –  President Barack Obama's surprise announcement last week that his administration would change its deportation policy to become more "humane" shows how the immigration battle has narrowed after months of congressional deadlock.As recently as last year, immigrant rights activists, along with an unusually broad coalition of business, labor and religious groups, were united in their demand that Congress pass a sweeping bill to both remove the threat of deportation from many of the 11 million people here illegally and eventually make them citizens. But now activists just want to stop deportations.They have pressured Obama to limit the number of people sent back overseas, which led to his administration's announcement Thursday of a review of deportation policies after a meeting with the Hispanic Congressional Caucus. Activists also are pushing state legislatures to end participation in a program to help federal immigration authorities deport people and chaining themselves across entrances to local jails or immigration detention centers.- Reyna Montoya, 23, of Phoenix"We need relief and we need it soon," said Reyna Montoya, 23, of Phoenix, whose father is fighting deportationand who co-wrote an open letter with dozens of other young activists urging immigrant rights groups to stand down on the citizenship issue. "People who are directly affected just want peace. Later on they'll worry about becoming citizens."Immigrant rights groups still want to win citizenship for many who are in the U.S. without legal permission. But the shift to deportation relief shows the desperation felt by immigrant communities as deportations have continued, even as the president and many in Congress say they support changing the law to allow some of those people to stay in the U.S.It also represents the possible splintering of the diverse coalition for an immigration bill that would overhaul the system by expanding citizenship. And the more aggressive, confrontational tactics also raise the risk of a public backlash."One picture of a cop with a bloody nose and it's all over for these people," Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors greater restrictions on immigration, said of the activists.The change comes after many expected Congress to pass a sweeping immigration overhaul last year. Republicans have been torn between some in their base who want to step up deportations and others alarmed at how Hispanics, Asians and other fast-growing communities are increasingly leaning Democratic.The Senate in June passed a bipartisan bill to legalize, and eventually grant citizenship to, many of the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally. But the bill died in the Republican-controlled House. Republican leaders there floated a proposal that could stop short of citizenship for many people here illegally. But Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, acknowledged it stood little chance of passing.Meanwhile, Obama's administration is on track to having deported 2 million people during the past six years. Critics say that's more than President George W. Bush's administration deported, though some who push for a tougher immigration policy argue the Obama administration's numbers are inflated.Obama already has eased some deportations. In 2012, as he was trying to generate enthusiasm among Hispanic voters for his re-election, Obama granted people who were brought to the country illegally as children the right to work in the United States and protection from deportation if they had graduated high school or served in the military. Advocates are pressuring the president to expand that to other people here illegally. The administration has said it cannot make sweeping changes without Congress, and it is unclear what steps it will take after its review is completed to limit deportations.Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said it's inevitable that Obama makes changes. "This is a White House that has told the immigrant rights community that they had to build up enforcement massively to create the political climate for comprehensive immigration reform," Newman said. "Well, that gambit failed."Roy Beck of Numbers USA, which pushes for a more restrictive immigration policy, said expanding deportationrelief could also fail. "It looks radical," he said of the notion of sharply limiting removals.Activists are willing to take that risk and have grown tired of waiting for Washington.Late last year the Austin Immigrant Rights Coalition's members acknowledged there were no hopes of a big immigration bill anytime soon. They began pushing the local sheriff's office to end its participation in the Secure Communities program, which checks the immigration status of anyone booked into local jail and refers people here illegally to federal authorities. Last month, six coalition members were arrested after locking themselves together to block entrance to the county jail."We decided we needed to change our focus because this is a more winnable campaign," Executive Director Alejandro Laceres said. Of Congress, he added, "We don't have the luxury of moving at their pace."In Arizona, activists have launched a series of protests, including blocking buses transporting immigrants to courts. "We just realized we are losing too many people in our community," Carlos Garcia of the group Puente Arizona said in a telephone interview minutes before he was arrested outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. Worries about whether their tactics could cause a backlash "go out the window," he added. "Our heads hurt from thinking about the politics around it."At the state level, activists have had notable successes. The biggest victory came last year in California when Gov. Jerry Brown signed the Trust Act, barring California police from participating in Secure Communities. Immigrant rights groups are trying to replicate that legislation in Illinois and Massachusetts.Driving the efforts are cases like that of Abel Bautista, who was stopped for traveling 8 miles per hour over the speed limit on a Colorado interstate in 2012 and has been fighting deportation ever since. At first he was not too worried, because he expected an immigration overhaul last year to make the case moot. Now he worries about the lack of legislative action and the trauma inflicted on his three U.S. citizen children as his case drags on."We're just left hanging at loose ends," Bautista said in an interview, recounting how his children's performance at school has deteriorated and how they sob when he leaves for court hearings. "If the community unifies and has more demonstrations, maybe they will listen to us."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Attorney general says 'Dreamers' eligible for in-state tuition in Virginia FILE: Protesters call for immigration reform in 2012.APALEXANDRIA, Va. –  Attorney General Mark Herring is telling Virginia colleges that they can grant in-state tuition to thousands of students who were previously considered ineligible because of their immigration status.The policy change, announced Tuesday at Northern Virginia Community College, is a change from the Democrat's Republican predecessors.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn the past, the attorney general's office had advised that students who entered the country illegally were barred from receiving in-state tuition, even if they were children when they immigrated.Herring says students can qualify for the reduced tuition under a special immigration status created by the Obama administration for certain young people brought to the country as children.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Australian man asks US government to reopen green card case after his American husband dies LOS ANGELES –  A 72-year-old Australian man widowed by his American husband of more than three decades is renewing his pitch for a green card since the Obama administration eased policies on gay marriage.Anthony Sullivan asked immigration authorities Monday to reopen a petition filed in 1975 by his late husband, Richard Adams, so he can be awarded legal residency as the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe two were married during a brief period when a county clerk in Boulder, Colo., issued marriage licenses to gay couples in 1975. But the U.S. refused to grant immigration benefits for them.A spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to comment on the case. The agency began issuing green cards to married gay couples last year after a Supreme Court ruling. 
Biden To Push Immigration Reform At Naturalization Event In Atlanta (AP) –  Vice President Joe Biden will head to Atlanta this week to promote the need for an immigration overhaul during a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens.Biden will speak at a naturalization event Thursday at The King Center in Atlanta, the White House said. About 8,000 new U.S. citizens will be naturalized during 120 ceremonies at the beginning of November.A day earlier, Biden and President Barack Obama plan to huddle with religious leaders to urge the House to act on immigration. Among the leaders that will meet with Obama, Biden and top aides at the White House Wednesday morning are megachurch pastor Joel Hunter, National Association of Evangelicals President Leith Anderson and Jim Wallis of the social justice group Sojourners.On Tuesday Biden told Catholic clergy and other faith leaders he doesn't want immigration reform to die like gun control did.“Work the districts so these members understand how all their constituents feel, not just the loudest ones,” Biden said in Tuesday's conference call according to Politico. “This kind of reminds me of the gun control kind of fights we had, and gun safety. You know, the people who don’t want anything changed to have a more rational position, they’re the ones who show up in large numbers. The ones who strongly support us, they don’t show up. You guys have to show up.”Biden and Obama are backing an immigration overhaul that passed the Senate in June with bipartisan support. The bill has stalled in the House, where GOP leaders prefer a piecemeal approach.Hoping to dissolve the impasse, the Obama administration has been stressing the support the legislation enjoys from a broad range of groups, including business and religious groups that traditionally have been in lockstep with Republicans. Biden spoke Tuesday to Catholic leaders on a conference call about immigration, following pressure the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has placed on the House to pass the bill this year.But a top House Republican leader has told immigration advocates that lawmakers won't vote this year on the issue, raising the prospect that immigration will be postponed until 2014, when looming midterm elections may make it more difficult to pass a bill.In Georgia, Biden will address the need for a path to legalization for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the White House said. Such a path was included in the Senate bill but has faced stiff resistance from House Republicans.While in Atlanta, Biden will also headline a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.Based on reporting by the Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
The Billionaire And The Immigrant â Mark Zuckerberg And Carlos Vargas Join Forces In Silicon Valley For Immigration Reform They were born one year apart, into vastly different worlds.Carlos Vargas, 28, began life in poverty in Puebla, Mexico, where he shared one small bedroom with his widowed mother and three siblings. His mother, who crossed the U.S.-Mexican border illegally in 1990 with her four children, held multiple jobs here to make ends meet.Mark Zuckerberg, 29, started his life in Dobbs Ferry, an affluent New York suburb of tree-lined streets and meticulously tended lawns rimming million-dollar homes. Zuckerberg, also one of four children, is the son of a dentist and a psychiatrist.But if countless circumstances separated Vargas and Zuckerberg, a mastery of technology and a keen interest in seeing U.S. immigration laws overhauled created a bond.On Wednesday, the two men will join forces in Silicon Valley, where Zuckerberg is hosting a hackathon in which the Facebook chief executive, as well as other kings of the Internet â Dropboxâs Drew Houston, Groupon founder Andrew Mason and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman â will work with undocumented high-tech wiz kids on building tools to help immigrants and the push for immigration reform.(Hackathon is the term given to a marathon event in which programmers collaborate on software projects.)Vargas is one of 20 people chosen from hundreds of applicants across the country to be part of the two-day event at LinkedIn headquarters. They are scheduled to work with some of Silicon Valleyâs best and brightest coders to develop tech tools relating to immigration causes.âIt caught me by surprise to be chosen,â Vargas said in an interview with Fox News Latino days before his flight to California. âHere I am, and in just a few days, Iâm going to be speaking with Mark Zuckerberg about Facebook and immigration. This moment, the hackathon, could be history, we could create something that helps the push for immigration reform.â- Carlos Vargas, Staten Island college studentThe gathering will give the immigrants and the high-tech executives access to resources that each of them needs from the other. The executives have an almost endless supply of money, staff and technology. The immigrants have excelled in technology and engineering. Perhaps even more important, with English as their primary language and their American upbringing, they have -- in a way that eluded their elders -- mobilized masses and put together campaigns for immigration reform.Twin Passions: Immigration And ComputersVargas was just five years old when his mother, Teresa Galindo, brought him on the 15-day trek across the border. The Staten Island, N.Y. resident has been part of the Dreamer movement, founded by young immigrants who pushed for Congress to pass a measure that would give undocumented people who were brought as minors a chance to legalize their status.They changed immigration activism, casting aside the anonymity that undocumented advocates insisted on, and identifying themselves fully -- unflinchingly stating their first name and last name -- and wearing shirts at rallies that declared âundocumented and unafraid.âBut most of all, Vargas and other Dreamers, who grew up posting and tweeting, turned to social media as the engine of their immigration reform campaign. Vargas developed his passion and gift for computers early, spending his time on them while friends were on the basketball court or soccer field.âIf it wasnât for social media, a lot of work weâve done wouldnât have been possible,â said Vargas of Dreamers. He manages the website and social media network for DRM Action Coalition, an organization that advocates for immigration reform.When Vargas applied to be part of the hackathon, he wrote in his essay that immigration reform was not just an issue in the news to him.âI said itâs about my life,â he said.Vargas and others in his hackathon team of six are working on a mobile app that lets users search for people who are detained in federal immigration facilities. The app also would help those facing deportation launch campaigns.Vargas is majoring in marketing economics and computer engineering at the College of Staten Island. He is track to graduate in the spring. The degree will cap years of taking just a few courses here and a few courses there while earning the money to pay his full tuition.Zuckerberg has been an increasingly vocal proponent for comprehensive immigration reform, driven by the high-tech industryâs interest in an expansion of visas for high-skill workers and, more recently, his growing alliances with Dreamers.He founded a pro-immigration-reform lobby group, FWD.us, which this week bought a mid-six-figure, English and Spanish-language ad titled âWhy We Waitâ on national cable television which expresses frustration with the failure of Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law.It is the latest public push in a year in which Zuckerberg has maintained a high profile on the issue of  immigration reform.Earlier this year, Zuckerberg appeared at a screening of âDocumented,â a movie about undocumented immigrants and spoke about the need for immigration reform. In the San Francisco appearance, Zuckerberg said his interest in an overhaul of U.S. immigration policy surpassed bringing in more high-tech workers from overseas."There are 11 million undocumented people who came here to work hard and contribute to the country," Zuckerberg said, "and I don't think it's quite as polarized as people always say."Hopes For the HackathonAt the hackathon, the coders and their fellow undocumented techies will divide into teams of about six to brainstorm ideas, map some out, and then decide on which are the most viable and worth investing resources.âWe hope the hackathon sheds light on just a small fraction of the many talents of the undocumented immigrant community, and how our broken immigration system prevents 11 million people from realizing their full potential,â FWD.us President Joe Green wrote in a blog post.Vargas, who has a portrait of Thomas Jefferson hanging near the desk where he spends hours on his Mac, badly wants to see the Silicon Valley gathering kick into gear projects that will resurrect immigration reform efforts in Congress.âI want to help the immigrant community, I want to do something bigger than for myself,â Vargas said. "I want reform for other immigrants, for fathers that got deported. This hackathon, I hope, will be the break that we need, the break that will bring exposure and awareness about the need for immigration reform.âVargasâs mother said she is bursting with pride about her sonâs meeting with giants of high-tech. It is also a remarkable twist of fate. Her son will be in the kind of rarified setting that is the kind that the Other Half inhabits -- people who own the homes, for instance, that she and her friends have toiled in.âWhen we crossed the border, the way that I kept them focused during all those days was by telling them that we were going to a better land, a land where there were many opportunities. I told them they could have a great life if they worked hard,â said Galindo, who could only get as far as the third grade in Mexico.She felt afraid when her sons, Carlos and older brother Cesar, became visible advocates in the Dreamer movement. But she threw her support behind them, adding that âfaith that things will turn out wellâ â a spiritual view that long has guided her â helped allay her fears.Vargas, who never met his father, a bus driver who died a month before he was born, said he is glad he put aside his one-time shame over his status. He is glad, too, that he did not to listen to a high school guidance counselor who said heâd never be able to keep studying because he was undocumented."When they were young, my sons told me 'I can't go to college because we don't have papers,'" recalled their mother. "I said 'Yes you will go to college. One door may close, but another will open.'"Vargas was one of thousands of Dreamers who got a work permit and a driverâs license under an Obama administration program that allowed for a two-year reprieve from deportation for those brought illegally as minors.What does he hope to say to Zuckerberg?âIâd like to say âThanks for the support for immigration reform, there are a lot of peopleâs lives at stake, not just Dreamers,ââ Vargas said. âIâd say that our families, our parents, are what made Dreamers possible. Iâll say âItâs still a long fight ahead of us. Please stay with us, stick with us.ââElizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Bishops To Say Mass At Border Fence To Highlight 'Human Aspect' Of Immigration PHOENIX (AP) –  Less than a week after President Barack Obama discussed immigration reform in a meeting with Pope Francis, a delegation of Roman Catholic leaders is visiting the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday to raise awareness about the plight of immigrants and to pray for policy changes.Cardinal Sean O'Malley, one of Francis' key advisers and the leader of the Boston Archdiocese, will be joined by members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for an early morning walk in the desert along the border, followed by a Mass at the fence separating the two countries in southern Arizona."The purpose of this journey here to Arizona is to raise a consciousness about the need for our president and Congress to pass immigration policy and reform to address a broken system," said Bishop Gerald Kicanas of the Tucson Diocese. "We're also here to pray for those who have lost their lives along the border."Dozens of immigrants die each year in the brutal desert terrain while trying to cross illegally into the United States along the roughly 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico. The Catholic leaders note that immigrants are simply trying to find better lives and jobs in America and that thousands of them have died crossing the Southwest desert in recent decades."What we fail to remember in this debate is the human aspect of immigration — that immigration is primarily about human beings, not economic or social issues," said Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Seattle and chairman of the conference's Committee on Migration. "Those who have died, and those deported each day, have the same value and innate God-given dignity as all persons, yet we ignore their suffering and their deaths."The push for immigration reform in Congress has been stalled for months, with Democrats and Republicans unable to reach an agreement over the divisive issue.House Democrats last week tried to force a vote on a comprehensive immigration bill, an effort that is likely to fail given Republican reluctance to address the topic in an election year while all signs point to major gains for the GOP in the November midterms.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June, but the measure stalled in the GOP-controlled House where Republicans have argued for a piecemeal approach to reforming the system.During his first meeting with Pope Francis last week at the Vatican, Obama expressed his interest in getting immigration reform through Congress, explaining during a news conference that "there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.""And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he (Pope Francis) is very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported and are separated from families," Obama said.The group of Catholic leaders spent Monday touring the border region in Mexico and Arizona and meeting with U.S. Border Patrol officials to learn more about the dangers and challenges agents face daily while patrolling a region besieged by drug smugglers and human traffickers."The primary purpose of our visit is to learn and understand, to experience firsthand the plight of migrants and the complexity of border issues in order to continue to prod our president and Congress to take steps to fix this problem," said Kicanas, the Tucson bishop. "There is drug trafficking, there is human trafficking and people are being exploited."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Blame Game Continues: Obama Points Finger At GOP For Inaction On Immigration President Barack Obama urged Congress Wednesday to vote on immigration reform and blamed House Republicans for failing to bring the issue up to the floor for a vote, as Latinos and immigration activists continue to scold the administration – and Democrats – for not doing enough to curb deportations."I urge House Republicans to listen to the will of the American people and bring immigration reform to the House floor for a vote," Obama said in the statement.The statement comes as pressure mounts from activists and members of the Latino community to act boldly on immigration reform or risk losing their support in the fall midterm elections. Some of them would like Obama to use executive action to overhaul the immigration system. But at a White House meeting with religious leaders Tuesday, Obama emphasized he wouldn't act on his own while there was still a chance for congressional action."Republicans in the House of Representatives have repeatedly failed to take action, seemingly preferring the status quo of a broken immigration system over meaningful reform," Obama went on to say. "Instead of advancing commonsense reform and working to fix our immigration system, House Republicans have voted in favor of extreme measures like a punitive amendment to strip protections from 'Dreamers'".Immigration activists, meanwhile, say they feel betrayed by Obama, who was elected with strong Latino and Asian support in 2008. They complain his strategy of winning GOP cooperation by increasing enforcement has failed. Three immigration activists have been on a hunger strike in front of the White House since Tuesday, pleading that their loved ones be released from immigration detention centers.A bill to toughen up border security and offer a path to citizenship for many of the nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has remained stalled in the Republican-led House of Representatives for 10 months after passing the Senate in June."The majority of Americans are ahead of House Republicans on this crucial issue and there is broad support for reform, including among Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and faith and law enforcement leaders," Obama said in his Wednesday statement. "We have a chance to strengthen our country while upholding our traditions as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants."Activists have dubbed the president the "deporter in chief" for the nearly 2 million deportations completed during his time in office and demand he stop deportations and allow more immigrants to remain legally in the U.S. More specifically, they'd like the president to simply expand DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which provides two-year work permits to eligible immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. So far, the program has helped 600,000 people, but activists believe millions more can be included if the policy were expanded.But Republicans warn any move by Obama on immigration reform without the backing of Congress will end any possibility for cooperation on a comprehensive bill. Despite the complaints from activists, Republicans accuse the Obama administration of inflating its record on deportations by counting people removed as they're attempting to cross the border or shortly thereafter. In the 2013 fiscal year more than 60 percent of the nearly 370,000 deportations were of recent border crossers, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Boehner hits brakes on immigration overhaul  House Speaker John Boehner hit the brakes on immigration legislation on Thursday, saying it will be "difficult" to move any bill in the current climate -- comments that signal a rough road ahead for one of President Obama's top 2014 priorities. Obama had urged Congress to pass immigration reform during his State of the Union address last week. A glimmer of common ground appeared days later when, during the House Republican retreat, GOP leaders issued guidelines for what they would accept in a comprehensive immigration overhaul. The guidelines included a path to legal status for some illegal immigrants. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBut Boehner, under pressure from conservative rank-and-file members to slow things down, said Thursday that lawmakers remain concerned about the administration's willingness to enforce immigration law. "There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws, and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," Boehner said. The speaker said he'd continue to look for a way forward. "I have made clear for 15 months the need for the Congress and the administration to work together on the issue of immigration reform. It needs to get done. I'm going to continue to talk to my members about how to move forward but the president is going to have to do his part as well," he said. Though Boehner did not go so far in his remarks, senior Republican sources told Fox News that Boehner is effectively putting up a stop sign on immigration legislation. "Tap the brakes on immigration reform," one senior aide said. "Just don't say dead." Another said Boehner doesn't feel there is any way he can move a bill when significant "trust" issues remain between GOP lawmakers and the president. The remarks are a shift from the tone of the House GOP document released last week, which stressed that any immigration bill must strengthen security and enforcement, but opened the door to allowing some illegal immigrants to achieve legal status. Though many Democrats ultimately want illegal immigrants to get a path to citizenship, Obama and others indicated they'd be willing to negotiate. Boehner's comments now throw into doubt whether the White House can convince House Republicans to pursue a bill this year. The White House, though, made clear that it will continue to push Congress to act. "We remain optimistic about the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform in 2014," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. Fox News' Chad Pergram and Mike Emanuel contributed to this report. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Boehner mocks Republican colleagues on immigration March 26, 2014: House Speaker John Boehner speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.APHouse Speaker John Boehner reportedly mocked his GOP colleagues for their resistance to immigration legislation during a speech in his home district, in the latest sign he's pushing aggressively to break the logjam in Congress -- in defiance of some in his own party. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Boehner took congressional Republicans to task during a talk to a local Rotary Club in Ohio. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"Here's the attitude. Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard," Boehner said, according to the paper, pretending to whine as he talked. He added: "We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and it's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just don't want to ... They'll take the path of least resistance." Boehner reportedly said he's had "every brick and bat and arrow shot at me" over the issue. GOP House leaders have been giving off mixed signals about the chances for immigration legislation this year. In February, Boehner effectively threw the brakes on talks, saying it would be "difficult" to move any bill as long as lawmakers are concerned about the administration's enforcement of existing immigration law. Those concerns still exist -- if anything, they've grown as the Department of Homeland Security undergoes an intensive review of deportation policies. But Boehner in recent days has signaled he wants to get the House quickly moving again on legislation. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Boehner said at a recent fundraiser he was "hell-bent on getting this done this year." His office later reiterated that there could be no action until President Obama can be a better partner. Boehner's deputy, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, took a similar tone after an apparently rough conversation with the president last week. Cantor also said House Republicans "do not support" a bill by Senate Democrats that would grant "amnesty" to illegal immigrants Still, Boehner appears to be putting himself out there on an issue that many Republicans would just as soon avoid in an election year. On the Senate side, Republicans have been blasting the administration over its current immigration approach. Twenty-two senators just sent a letter to Obama accusing the administration of "an astonishing disregard for the Constitution" by considering easing off deportation policies. The letter, signed by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and others, said the changes would be a "near complete abandonment of basic immigration enforcement." DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has been reviewing deportations, under pressure from immigrant advocacy groups to make the policies more humane. The Associated Press reports that he is looking at limiting deportations for those who don't have serious criminal records.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Border Patrol Agent Accused Of Kidnapping And Raping 3 Women Laid To Rest A U.S. Border Patrol agent who took his own life, after allegedly assaulting, kidnapping, and raping three undocumented immigrants from Honduras a week ago, was laid to rest.Funeral and burial services for 32-year-old Esteban Manzanarez were held Thursday.The case remains under investigation by the FBI.Family, friends, and federal agents said their last good-byes to Manzanarez, who is survived by his parents, two sisters, and two children.According to authorities, Manzanares was working his regular day shift as a U.S. Border Patrol agent along the busiest stretch of Mexican border when a trio of Honduran immigrants spotted him and offered to surrender.A woman, her teenage daughter and a teenage family friend later told authorities they were taken into custody and driven away from a popular county park just north of the Rio Grande and upriver to a more remote, scrub brush-filled area. It was there, in this rugged no-man's land between the river and a stretch of rust-covered steel border fence, that the older woman says the group was assaulted by a man wearing green fatigues who left the area with one of the girls.Based on the woman's description of the attacker's clothing and his vehicle, investigators quickly concluded the suspect was likely a U.S. Border Patrol agent, according a federal law enforcement official.More than seven hours after the older woman was first spotted Wednesday, her wrists cut and bloodied, agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement found Manzanares dead in his apartment from what investigators have described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The missing teenager was there, too, bound and naked.For more stories go to foxrio2.comThe Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Border Patrol rescue beacons let immigrants call for help April 13, 2011: United States border patrol agent Shawn Gisler looks across the fence at Mexico as he patrols the U.S. border in San Ysidro, California.APBUENOS AIRES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Ariz. –  Thorn-coated bushes, rock-covered terrain, scorching temperatures. A hissing rattlesnake.These are just few of the many perils migrants crossing from Mexico into the southern Arizona desert encounter every day. And far more of them will attempt to cross this summer, the U.S. Border Patrol predicts.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe agency unveiled its plans Wednesday for dealing with the problem of immigrants dying in the desert, including 10 new beacons that allow migrants to call for help at the push of a red button. The agency is also adding new hoisting systems on helicopters to rescue immigrants.Officials from the Tucson sector on Wednesday gave reporters, government officials and immigration activists a demonstration of the latest tools they have to assist those who cross from Mexico into Arizona and get injured or dehydrated and cannot continue walking. The demonstration was held 20 miles north of the Sasabe port of entry to Mexico, southwest of Tucson, and included a nearly one-mile hike through rough terrain where migrants often cross.The border patrol says it sees a steep increase in calls for help coming from its 22 beacons as the summer approaches."The smugglers are telling people, 'oh it's going to be a short walk, it's not going to be a big deal,' when the reality is you're looking at 114 degree temperatures, this very rugged terrain that you see behind us, and once they cross the border, many times they're abandoned there and left vulnerable to the elements of the desert," Tucson sector chief Manuel Padilla, Jr., said."It's either they live or die.

Facing Rising Influx Of Illegal Crossings, South Texas To Get Infusion Of Border Patrol Agents McALLEN, Texas (AP) –  More than 100 Border Patrol agents from California and Arizona have been shifted to the southernmost tip of Texas, the country's busiest sector for illegal immigration, the agency announced Wednesday.While arrests of immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally have fallen or stabilized on other parts of the border, they've soared in South Texas, driven in large part by immigrants from Central America.The temporary assignments are the latest signal the agency is trying to adjust its staffing to meet the new reality along the Southwest border. The temporarily assigned agents arrived at the Rio Grande Valley this week, and the length of their stay is not set, said Border Patrol spokesman Danny Tirado. Last year, the Rio Grande Valley sector also began receiving the bulk of the new academy graduates.Nearly 3,100 Border Patrol agents were assigned to the Rio Grande Valley last fiscal year, about 1,000 fewer than the Tucson, Ariz., sector, even though the Texas sector sprinted past Tucson last year in total arrests.The Border Patrol made more than 154,000 arrests in the Rio Grande Valley sector last fiscal year, an increase of 58 percent from the previous year. Tucson made almost 121,000 arrests.The pace is accelerating this year. The Rio Grande Valley sector has already made more than 95,000 arrests midway through this fiscal year and seized more than 300,000 pounds of marijuana. The agents from Arizona and California are joining some already sent from the neighboring Laredo sector.U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol, characterized the shift in resources as a "risk-based approach" aimed at disrupting criminal smuggling organizations.Additionally, the agency and its local and federal partners have identified members of such criminal organizations that it will target for arrest. It did not release their names."The subjects we've identified are key players in the illicit networks that facilitate the majority of illegal cross-border activity in the area," Customs and Border Protection South Texas Commander Robert L. Harris said in a prepared statement. "These groups prey on illegal aliens by extorting money, confining them in deplorable conditions, and often physically and sexually assaulting them."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

British woman arrested, deported from Sri Lanka for Buddha tattoo May 26, 2013: A Buddha statue at Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo, Sri Lanka. (Reuters)Officials from the predominantly Buddhist nation of Sri Lanka deported a British tourist Thursday for having a tattoo of Buddha on her arm.Naomi Coleman, a 37-year-old practicing Buddhist, was traveling from India through Sri Lanka on her way to the Maldives on Monday when authorities detained her at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo, BBC reports.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“I just want to get out of this place. I have come twice to Sri Lanka, but I have never faced this with my tattoo,” Coleman told Reuters shortly before she was deported.A Sri Lankan court determined the tattoo was an insult to the country’s religion.Senior immigration official Chulananda Perera said the court decided to deport Coleman, in part to protect her, saying she could have been “vulnerable” if permitted to stay on the island.“Some Sri Lankans could get offended,” Perera told Reuters.Coleman, a mental health nurse, said she told police she practiced Buddhism and had attended meditation retreats and workshops in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India.“If there is a rule like this, Sri Lankan authorities should clearly say that Buddha tattoos are banned," Coleman said. "I am a practicing Buddhist and Buddhism is all about compassion and kindness."Coleman spent a night in prison in Negombo and two nights in a detention center following her deportation order, while officials completed a security check.Authorities persuaded her to hire a lawyer for $38, but Coleman said he did not communicate with her and she didn’t think her statement was conveyed to anyone.Coleman told BBC she was visited at the center by an embassy official and a representative from Sri Lanka's Tourism Development Authority. The authority paid for her flight home in business class and offered to fly her back for a free vacation in the future."Since she couldn't enjoy her stay ... we are ready to welcome her back," a tourism spokesman said. "Technically we will have to obtain clearance from the judiciary whether she can travel covering the tattoo in Sri Lanka."Police spokesman Ajith Rohana said Coleman was convicted under a law which forbids "deliberately and maliciously outraging the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.""We know tourists don't do this intentionally," Rohana said.Coleman returned to London once released.Sri Lankan authorities denied entry to a British man for a similar tattoo of Buddha last year. A year earlier, three French tourists were given suspended prison sentences for kissing a Buddha statue, BBC reported.Technically, there's no law making it illegal to have Buddha tattoo in Sri Lanka, but the predominantly Buddhist nation is very sensitive about its religion. About 70 percent of Sri Lanka's 20 million people are Buddhist, the BBC reported. 
Ignoring Latino Community May Have Cost Kathleen Sebelius Her Job Hispanics were supposed to be one of the groups in the country who benefited the most from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But a few days after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced her resignation, Latinos working on the ground to help uninsured members of the community sign up for Obamacare say that they are not shocked about her announcement last Thursday.“It’s not a surprise she is no longer Secretary,” Jane Delgado, president of the nonpartisan advocacy network National Alliance for Hispanic Health, told Fox News Latino. “We had told the Department [of Health and Human Services] that what was most needed before enrollment was to go out to the community and educate them about insurance."Delgado, whose organization’s Obamacare help line spoke to more than 1,100 people on the March 31st deadline alone, went on to say, “I think a lot of [the rollout] was well intentioned but not well delivered.”For more than two months, the healthcare.gov site was plagued with technical problems that left many Americans frustrated and the Obama administration embarrassed. But, critics say, the failures were even more disastrous in how the law was rolled out for Latinos. Before Obamacare, about one-third of Hispanics in the U.S. were uninsured, a far higher percentage than either whites or African-Americans. Ironically, the community with the most to gain from the law had to deal with the biggest delays and the biggest glitches and sign-up problems.Latino advocates point to a shortage of in-person navigators and translators to guide consumers, as well as a resistance in mixed-status families – in which at least one person is undocumented – to giving out immigration status information to an administration that has deported nearly 2 million people. Numerous federal officials tried to assure people that the information collected from the health exchanges won’t be shared with immigration services, but skepticism remained high.“The reality of what’s happening on the ground undercuts the message they are trying to send,” said Alvaro Huerta, staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. “The community sees the deportation machine that the administration has implemented and they say, ‘Why should I trust giving information to the federal government when I hear over and over again that people are being deported at record numbers?’”Then there were the technical glitches. The Obama administration launched the Spanish language version of healthcare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, three months late, in December, but the site wasn’t fully functional until February. Potential enrollees experienced glitches, mistranslations and malfunctions on the site.On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Sebelius called the administration’s timeline for having ready the health care law’s online sign-up system “flat-out wrong” and said the early months of the Obamacare rollout were “a pretty dismal time” and a low point of her five-year tenure, even as she defended the law’s impact and said millions of Americans now have access to health care because of it.“They overestimated the ease in which people would understand how the health care system works when they are coming from countries that have different systems, and they underestimated the resources to get information to the Latino community,” Huerta explained to FNL.He said while the administration has made vast improvements to the Spanish-language site, there’s a need for more in-person and telephone translators. Oftentimes, people have to call back multiple times to get through the application process, and that can be frustrating, Huerta said.Delgado told FNL that she believes the administration, despite warnings and advice from her and other Latino advocates about the need for a more hands-on approach to reaching out to people in the Latino community, relied too heavily on a website to be the cure to America’s health care ills.“Technology is very glitzy,” Delgado said. “The thought was the website was going to make everything simple.”  When in reality, she said, “The love of technology blinded people to what were the possibilities … We forget that in order to be successful you have to be high-tech and high touch.”Recent polls show that Hispanics, who once favored Obamacare by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, are growing sour on the healthcare law. A Pew Research Center Poll showed Hispanics are now split evenly on whether they approve of the ACA. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows 46 percent of Latinos have a favorable view of Obamacare, down from 56 percent in September.“I don’t think we can blame it on one person,” Huerta said. “But we had given them reminders about language and immigration concerns and I’m not sure that was prioritized. I think there was a lot more that could have been done to prepare for it.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatinoBryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).

Businesses call for immigration reform South Carolina business leaders and businessmen on Monday denounced the scarcity of labor in the state and expressed hope that the open debate in the Republican Party will urgently push immigration reform.Representatives of the hotel and tourism industry, construction and agriculture emphasized at a press conference in Columbia, the state capital, that although each sector has its opinion and interests in the matter, it is necessary for Congress to act as soon as possible."It's a priority issue that we go back and we have comprehensive immigration reform which includes protecting our borders and making sure we bring in legalized immigrants who can do the skilled labor and having them paying taxes, learning the language and being part of the community," Mark Nix, executive director of the Home Builders Association of South Carolina, said.The Republican Party announced last week its principles for dealing with the situation of the 11 million undocumented foreigners who live in the United States."It's good at last to see the business community reacting and acknowledging the economic contributions of immigrants," Ivan Segura, president of the Council of Mexicans in the Carolinas, told Efe on Monday.South Carolina is one of the pioneer states in the implementation of the E-Verify program whereby the immigration status of workers can be verified, and it has one of the strictest state immigration laws in the country along with a special unit to arrest immigrants without the proper papers.It is estimated that more than 240,884 Hispanics live in South Carolina, most of them of Mexican origin and working on farms, in construction and services such as restaurants and hotels.

Business Interests On Educated Workers, Immigration, Infrastructure Question Texan Lawmakers AUSTIN, Texas (AP) –  Business interests are walking the halls of the Texas Capitol calling on lawmakers to rethink some of their past policies, hoping that after the November election they can win some key victories next year.The business lobby's wish list, expressed at legislative hearings and press conferences, includes better-educated workers, more spending on infrastructure and an overhaul of immigration policies. Where these issues fall on the ideological continuum is in the eye of the beholder, but for these trade associations and executives, these are the essential duties of government and critical for economic growth.Candidates running for election in November are also taking up these issues, but surprisingly their positions are not breaking along traditional partisan lines.Immigration policy is the most volatile issue, and one that is dividing Texas Republicans. A coalition of trade associations representing restaurants, hotels, agriculture and property owners has called for legalizing the workers currently in the country — who don't have a criminal record — and setting up a reliable pipeline to bring in more immigrant labor as needed.While the main target of their lobbying effort is the Republican caucus in Congress, immigration policy has divided Texas Republican primary voters, who largely oppose relaxing current laws, and Republican leaders who are trying to build the party by growing their numbers.The current state Republican Party platform calls for a guest-worker program, but tea party groups are organizing an effort to take it out at this June's party convention.Another target is the Texas Dream Act, which allows people brought to Texas illegally as children to pay in-state tuition at public universities, even if they don't have permission to be in the country. The two Republican candidates for lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst and Dan Patrick, want to rescind the act, while gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott wants to leave it.Democrats, meanwhile, are campaigning for an overhaul of federal law in line with the business interests.Nothing has riled up the Texas Association of Business more than Republican-led cuts to school testing and revised high school graduation standards. The group's president Bill Hammond complains that only 25 percent of public school graduates are ready for work or college, and he argues that testing lets parents hold schools accountable for student performance.Public education took center-stage in the governor's race last week, with Abbott introducing his plan to boost student performance. He broke with Republican lawmakers who in 2011 called pre-kindergarten education state-subsidized daycare and reduced funding from full-day to half-day programs.Abbott's Democratic opponent Wendy Davis has railed against this decision as a Fort Worth state senator and has tried to make her filibuster of the 2011 budget cuts the centerpiece of her campaign.She attacked Abbott last week for his choice in education experts, but Abbott's support for full-time, state-funded pre-kindergarten is a significant recognition that Texas is short-changing public schools. Texas ranks in the bottom third of states in third grade reading scores, and Abbott is calling for pre-kindergarten programs that will make a significant difference in student performance in later years.Abbott's tea party allies in the Legislature, though, may not be on board. Based on the results of the March primary, the incoming Republican-controlled Legislature may be the most conservative yet and many are calling for property and sales tax cuts rather than increased spending.Those lawmakers demonstrated their reluctance to open the state's wallet in 2013 by choosing to let voters decide whether to tap the rainy day fund for water and transportation projects. Voters approved water funding in 2013 and are expected to approve transportation spending in November, but those constitutional amendments are only a drop in the bucket toward solving the state's long-term funding crisis for infrastructure.Last week the Texas Association of Business's Stephen Minick warned lawmakers that their failure to invest in improved infrastructure sent the wrong signal to companies interested in moving to Texas.House Speaker Joe Straus on Friday appointed a special committee to study transportation funding issues, but tea party activists have questioned his conservatism and are more interested in shrinking government spending.During the Great Recession, Texas executives praised lawmakers for their fiscal prudence. Now that state revenues are breaking records well over $100 billion, they are telling lawmakers it's time to invest in workers and infrastructure. The question is whether lawmakers will listen.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigrants Plan Trip To Vatican To Seek Pope's Support For Immigration Reform A coalition of activists who want U.S. laws changed to provide a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants is traveling to Rome Friday, hoping to meet with Pope Francis and enlist his help in their cause.The Los Angeles Archdiocese is working with the coalition to get an audience with the pope on Wednesday, March 26, a day before he is to meet with President Obama, according to the Orange County Register.The group, which includes more than a dozen activists and at least two children whose parents are undocumented immigrants, hopes to personally deliver more than 1,000 letters to the pope from children whose families are in danger of deportation, the newspaper said.If they get to meet with Francis, they plan to ask him to talk about the importance of immigration reform with Obama when the two meet.“I'm going to give him a card and I want him to hear my situation,” said 10-year-old Jersey Vargas, whose parents are undocumented and who has been designated by the group as their sort of spokesperson. “We are not criminals. My parents came to this country for a better life. But my dad is in immigration detention and I'm afraid he will be deported. I am going to tell the Pope I feel very sad.”On Sunday, toward the end of Mass, Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez gave the San Fernando Valley student and others going on the trip his blessing.Gomez prayed that God would “give them the courage … as they stand with the poor in their struggle for dignity and justice. … And guide us to reform our immigration policies; that our country may live up to its spiritual promises of liberty and justice for all.”Last week, after a meeting with three members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about increasing exasperation among Latinos and other immigration reform advocates over the record number of deportations, Obama pledged to look into more humane ways to deal with immigration.CHC members, including Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, pressed the president to use his executive powers to stop the record rate of deportations – nearly 2 million since he took office.The caucus had been planning to draft a resolution demanding the president curb deportations, and extend a reprieve from removals from the U.S. to more undocumented immigrants than just those who have it now.In 2012, Obama announced an initiative, known as DACA, that would suspend deportation for two years for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors, and who meet other criteria. Those immigrants who qualified for DACA have been able to obtain work permits and driver’s licenses.In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure that both tightened enforcement and called for a path to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants. But the effort stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority and where there is resistance to any measure that would provide a path to legalize for undocumented immigrants.“It's very nice for President Barack Obama to tell us quite often that he supports immigration reform,” said Juan José Gutierrez, coordinator of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition. “But we believe we've gotten to the point where we need more than moral support.”“I don't think any of us in our wildest dreams thought we'd be going to the Vatican,” Gutierrez said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
California's Immigration Law Is Slowing Down Deportations As Fewer Immigrants Are Being Turned Over To The Feds SAN DIEGO (AP) –  Far fewer immigrants arrested by California law enforcement are being turned over to federal authorities for deportation since a new state law went into effect in January.The law was pushed by immigrant advocates and directs law enforcement agencies to more quickly release those without serious criminal records rather than hold them so federal officials can take them into custody for deportation proceedings.Already, according to a review by The Associated Press, the new law appears to be having a big impact in slowing deportations at a time when President Barack Obama is looking to ease immigration enforcement policies nationwide and appease immigrant advocates who say his administration has been too tough.Until now, California has accounted for a third of deportations under U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's Secure Communities program, which screens the fingerprints of arrestees for potential immigration violations.While it was expected the state law known as the Trust Act would reduce the number of people held for possible deportation, it wasn't clear how significant the drop would be.Since sheriff's departments are responsible for most bookings, the AP surveyed those agencies in 23 counties responsible for most of California's deportations under the program.Not all supplied data for the first two months of this year, but among the 15 that did, there was a 44 percent drop, from 2,984 people to 1,660. Those 15 counties included four of the five largest in the state — Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino. Orange County could not provide 2013 data because officials do not keep paperwork on this issue for more than a year."It suggests that before the Trust Act went into effect, at least in California, Secure Communities was having a most significant impact on relatively minor criminal offenders, as opposed to the gang bangers the president was saying were being targeted," said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis school of law and an immigration law expert.While most counties appear to be complying with the law, some sheriffs' departments do not appear to have adopted policies to put it into action when the year began.Angela Chan, senior staff attorney at San Francisco-based civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said advocates have received reports of about a dozen instances where people should have been released under the new law but weren't."There is inconsistency, and that is something we're working on," she said. "This is a law they have to follow."Secure Communities has led to more than 300,000 deportations since October 2008. The program has immigration agents screen the fingerprints of arrestees and ask local law enforcement to hold for 48 hours those they want to deport until they can pick them up and take them to a detention facility.Touted by supporters as a way to identify and deport those who have committed serious crimes, the program also has led to people with relatively minor infractions being sent back to their home countries.Under the Trust Act, immigrants facing trial on serious criminal charges or with serious criminal records can be held on immigration grounds, but those charged with lesser crimes are released on bail or after serving time, just like Americans.The law specifies which crimes are considered serious so that wherever someone is arrested the treatment is supposed to be largely the same, though some counties may choose not to honor immigration holds, such as Santa Clara.In passing the legislation, California joined Connecticut and more than a dozen jurisdictions including Cook County, Ill., and Newark, N.J., in declining requests for immigration holds. State lawmakers in Massachusetts are considering similar legislation.ICE declined to comment. The agency is evaluating the impact of the Trust Act.Thomas Homan, ICE's executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations, told a congressional committee in March that laws like California's are having an effect."It takes that leverage away from us," Homan said, adding that he'd rather have his agents "arrest these people in a safe setting than be on the street looking for them, especially for the ones that have a significant public safety threat conviction."ICE officials can pick up people arrested in California on minor violations, but must do so upon their release. That is much harder to coordinate and ICE agents don't have the resources to get to every jail to pick up every arrestee."We can't stop them from taking anyone if they're here," said Cmdr. John Ingrassia of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. "We're just not going to hold them."The AP survey showed county-by-county disparities in the year-to-year percentage reduction of people held, from 3 percent in San Luis Obispo to 93 percent in San Francisco, which last year passed a local law that restricts the use of immigration holds even further.Los Angeles, which handled the most cases, fell from 1,143 last year to 818 in the first two months of 2014, a 28 percent decline. San Diego was second in overall cases handled but dropped 58 percent, from 426 to 180.Immigration law experts said it's too soon to pinpoint a reason for the variation. Potential factors include a delay in some counties implementing the law and different arrest priorities and practices among the agencies, immigration experts said.In Sacramento County, Martin Del Agua was arrested in February for investigation of drunken and disorderly conduct after deputies went to his home to address a neighbor's complaint about loud music, and was later placed on an immigration hold, sheriff's officials said.Del Agua's lawyer says the arrest was baseless, and notes he was never charged and should have been released the same day. The 37-year-old Mexican, a landscaper and father of two, was released two days later after his wife and lawyer challenged his detention, he said.Sheriff's officials acknowledged the arrest occurred before the department developed a Trust Act policy.Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern is president of the California State Sheriffs' Association, which opposed the Trust Act. He estimated the number of people in his county booked into jails and turned over to ICE has fallen about 70 percent this year.Ahern expressed concern about who is being freed. "Common sense will tell you people who are violating the law and taken into custody many times are responsible for unrelated crimes," he said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Can Obama scare supporters to the polls? April 11, 2014: U.S. President Obama laughs with film director Spike Lee (C) and Reverend Al Sharpton (R).Reuters**Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**Buzz Cut: • Can Obama scare supporters to the polls? • Doctors despair at ObamaCare • Hillary flies first class with Boeing • Power Play: Dem struggles extend to Illinois • Matzoh luck at the checkpointADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTCAN OBAMA SCARE SUPPORTERS TO THE POLLS?MSNBC host Al Sharpton is back at the White House today, this time for a Holy Week prayer breakfast with President Obama and dozens of faith leaders. Sharpton’s arrival comes just two days after Obama embraced the controversial activist and former FBI informant at a New York event hosted by the liberal broadcaster. Obama used the Sharpton event to accuse Republicans of trying to reverse the 1965 Voting Rights Act and intentionally suppress black voters with state laws requiring voters to show identification. “The real voter fraud is those that try to deny our rights by making arguments about voter fraud.” Obama compared the ID laws to the Jim Crow restrictions of the segregated South and cast himself as a modern-day civil rights leader. It may not wash with most voters, but will it be enough to frighten the Democratic base into action?[WSJ: “[A blueprint first sketched out by a Yale University law student four years ago], which seized on a mostly ignored provision of the 1965 [Voting Rights] law, has become the government's strategy for challenging states it believes are enacting discriminatory voting laws, including North Carolina and Texas.”]It worked before - While liberals may be enthused that the president is back to attacking Republicans on matters of race, it’s not a risk-free path. The administration discovered the dangers of ham-handed outreach last week with a botched effort to alarm the single, female voters on whom Democrats rely. After getting pasted over their pay-equity gambit, though, the Obama Democrats are showing no reticence about applying blunt political force to sensitive topics, this time on race. But as campaign watchers learned in 2012, audacious negativity is not something of which Team Obama is afraid. In fact, the forecast for the coming election is increasingly negative and hostile. Remember, whatever was said about Obama’s unprecedentedly negative re-election campaign, it certainly worked.Top house Dem: GOP animated by racism - Fox News: New York Rep. Steve Israel said Sunday a significant part of the Republican Party is ‘animated by racism,’ marking the third time in recent days that a leading Democrat has appeared to make race an issue and drawn a sharp response from Republicans… Israel made his comments after Attorney General Eric Holder testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, then suggested the next day at a forum on civil rights that the past five years in Washington have been marked by ‘unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.’”[“This strikes me as kinda crybaby stuff from Holder. My sense about this is both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have benefited politically enormously from the fact that they are African American and the first to hold the jobs that they hold.” –Brit Hume on “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace”]No Obama generation in politics - NYT: “Unlike John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, who inspired virtual legislatures of politicians and became generational touchstones... [President Obama] has so far had little such influence. That is all the more remarkable considering he came to office tapping into spirit of volunteerism and community service that pollsters say is widespread and intense among young people. Mr. Obama has come to represent that spirit, but he has failed, pollsters say, to transform it into meaningful engagement in the political process. ‘If you were to call it an Obama generation, there was a window,’ said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. ‘That opportunity has been lost.’ He said the youth who came of voting age around the time of the 2008 election have since lost interest in electoral politics, and pointed to a survey he conducted last year among 18- to 29-year-olds. Although 70 percent said they considered community service an honorable endeavor, only 35 percent said the same about running for office.”DOCTORS DESPAIR AT OBAMACAREThe Daily Beast: “Unfortunately, things are only getting worse for most doctors, especially those who still accept health insurance. Just processing the insurance forms costs $58 dollars for every patient encounter, according to Dr. Stephen Schimpff, an internist and former CEO of University of Maryland Medical Center who is writing a book about the crisis in primary care. … What worries many doctors, however, is that the Affordable Care Act has codified this broken system into law. While forcing everyone to buy health insurance, [ObamaCare] might have mandated a uniform or streamlined claims procedure that would have gone a long way to improving access to care… Industry leaders are fixated on patient satisfaction, despite the fact that high scores are correlated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Indeed, trying to please whatever patient comes along destroys the integrity of our work. It’s a fact that doctors acquiesce to patient demands—for narcotics, x-rays, doctor’s notes—despite what survey advocates claim. And now that Medicare payments will be tied to patient satisfaction—this problem will get worse. Doctors need to have the ability to say no. If not, when patients go to see the doctor, they won’t actually have a physician—they’ll have a hostage.”OBAMACARE STRAINS TAX ENFORCEMENTHere’s one thing that might improve ObamaCare’s popularity - AP: “As millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday’s tax deadline, their chances of getting audited are lower than they have been in years. Budget cuts and new responsibilities are straining the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to police tax returns. This year, the IRS will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s. Taxpayer services are suffering, too, with millions of phone calls to the IRS going unanswered...Last year, the IRS audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals, the lowest rate since 2005…The IRS also is implementing large parts of President Obama’s health law, including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance.”WAIT.

Boeing, she said, ‘has just agreed to double its contribution to $2 million.’ Clinton did not point out that, to secure the donation, the State Department had set aside ethics guidelines that first prohibited solicitations of Boeing and then later permitted only a $1 million gift from the company… The November 2009 episode was an indicator of a mutually beneficial relationship between one of the world’s major corporations and a potential future president. Clinton functioned as a powerful ally for Boeing’s business interests at home and abroad, while Boeing has invested resources in causes beneficial to Clinton’s public and political image… In 2010, two months after Boeing won its $3.7 billion Russia deal, the company announced a $900,000 contribution to the William J. Clinton Foundation intended to rebuild schools in earthquake-ravaged Haiti... The company’s ties came into play again this month when its in-house lobbyist, former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating, co-hosted a fundraiser for Ready for Hillary, the super PAC backing her potential presidential run. The Boeing relationship meshed well with efforts by Clinton to expand the State Department’s advocacy of U.S. economic interests abroad, part of a broader philosophy that has emphasized partnering government with businesses to solve problems. A potential side benefit for Clinton has been the chance to strengthen ties to the kind of powerful allies in the business community who could assist a possible presidential bid...”[Hugh Hewitt explains why Hillary Clinton is President Obama's George H.W. Bush. “Bush the Elder won easily in 1988, with 40 states and 426 electoral votes. The third term, but calmer, is a good pitch. To stop a sequel the GOP will have to avoid their Dukakis, the man who seemed different, but who wasn't, in the end, anything except a decent but dull pol from a base state. The GOP will need a nominee with both fire in the belly and brains in abundance; rhetorical ability and an understanding of the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be.”]Meet the Clintons’ diet guru - NYT profiles the diet doctor who helps the Clintons get back into fighting trim for the campaign trail. “Nine years ago, on their 30th wedding anniversary, Hillary Rodham Clinton gave her husband a gift she hoped would ensure many more years together: Dr. Mark Hyman. Dr. Hyman was charged with helping the former president after a 2004 quadruple bypass surgery. In the time since, the doctor has become part of the Clintons’ circle of friends and advisers, but one with an important difference. The Clintons, after all, have a small army of aides who offer political and policy advice, but not many who can tell a former and potential president to lay off the ranch dressing…As she contemplates another run for the presidency, few topics receive more scrutiny than Mrs. Clinton’s health. And as with most female candidates, Mrs. Clinton’s personal appearance often emerges as a topic of conversation.”PAUL KNOCKS JEB ON ILLEGALS’ ‘ACT OF LOVE’Fox News Latino: “Sen. Rand Paul, [R-Ky.] a potential 2016 presidential contender, took aim at another possible Oval Office candidate – Jeb Bush – over the former Florida governor’s recent comments defending undocumented immigrants. In an interview on ABC’s ‘This Week’ that aired Sunday, Paul said that Bush was inarticulate when he described immigrants who come to the United States illegally as committing an ‘act of love.’ Paul said that those immigrants ‘are not bad people’ but added the United States ‘can't invite the whole world’ inside its borders. Paul…says Bush should have kept his focus on controlling the U.S. borders. Bush says the GOP cannot demonize immigrants and should show compassion.

Catholic bishops celebrate Mass along Mexico border Apr. 1, 2014: Immigration rights activists protest after Cardinal Sean O'Malley, leader of the Boston Archdiocese, led mass in Nogales, Ariz.APNOGALES, Ariz. –  Roman Catholic leaders made a rare visit to the border and celebrated Mass on Tuesday in the shadow of the fence separating the U.S. and Mexico, offering Holy Communion through the steel barrier to people on the Mexican side as they sought to bring attention to the plight of immigrants.Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the leader of the Boston Archdiocese, led a delegation of bishops from around the country and Mexico in the trip to the border, less than a week after President Barack Obama discussed immigration reform in a meeting with Pope Francis. They toured the border city of Nogales, walked along a notorious section of the border that was once a popular crossing point for drug and immigrant smugglers, and celebrated Mass just a few feet from the fence.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe Catholic leaders believe that immigration is a humanitarian issue that deserves urgent attention by Congress. They cite the dozens of immigrants who die each year in the brutal desert terrain while trying to cross illegally into the United States along the roughly 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico and note that the immigrants are simply trying to find better lives in America."This is not just a political or economic problem," O'Malley said Tuesday. "This is a moral problem."Several hundred people attended the Mass, which was translated into Spanish, and a few dozen people peered through the border fence from Mexico to watch the ceremony. O'Malley and Bishop Gerald Kicanas of the Tucson Diocese offered Holy Communion through the fence, providing people in Mexico wafers as a blessing as some of the recipients broke down in tears.During the Mass, the clergymen laid a wreath at the border wall to remember those who have died. It followed a similar event in Lampedusa, Italy, last year when the pope threw a wreath into the Mediterranean Sea to remember migrants who have died attempting to reach Europe.The push for immigration reform in Congress has been stalled for months, with Democrats and Republicans unable to reach an agreement over the divisive issue.House Democrats last week tried to force a vote on a comprehensive immigration bill, an effort that is likely to fail given Republican reluctance to address the topic in an election year while all signs point to major gains for the GOP in the November midterms.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June, but the measure stalled in the GOP-controlled House, where Republicans have argued for a piecemeal approach to reforming the system.Arizona state Sen. Al Melvin, a Republican running for governor, said the clergy visit will do little to solve problems on the border. He said developing private-sector jobs in northern Mexico and securing the border to prevent drug and human trafficking are needed to bring stability to both sides of the international boundary."Frankly, and I am a Catholic, I think this is irresponsible of these bishops to be down there," Melvin said. "They are not bringing stability to the border.  They are adding to the chaos of the border. And it's not helping to save lives. If anything, I believe it will contribute to more lives being lost. We need to secure the border to protect lives."During his first meeting with Pope Francis last week at the Vatican, Obama expressed his interest in getting immigration reform through Congress, explaining during a news conference that "there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.""And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he (Pope Francis) is very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported and are separated from families," Obama said.

Cesar Chavez's Legacy: Iconic Civil Rights Leader's Controversial Take On Illegal Immigration Rarely Explored Michael Harpold, a former U.S. Border Patrol agent, recalled driving in his green and white government van in the mid-1960âs that clearly identified his role to those who lived and worked in the area.Suddenly, a man on the side of the road waved at him to stop.The man, agent Harpold recalled, introduced himself as CÃ©sar Chavez, president of the National Farm Workers Association.âComing right to the point, Chavez said his members were complaining that the growers were hiring illegal aliens,â Harpold wrote in an article. âChavez saw illegal immigrants as not only a threat to his union, but as having different interests than the U.S. workers he sought to organize. The illegals slipped across the border, worked for a short time, then returned to Mexico. They were interested only in wages, he said, and not the benefits important to domestic farm workers and families.âIt is a side of the labor rights leader that often is eclipsed, or rendered absent altogether, by the more defining image of him as a benevolent defender of farm workers and â by extension â immigrants, regardless of their legal status.Chavezâs birthday on Sunday coincides with tributes to how Chavez, an Arizona-born descendant of Mexicans who toiled in fields as a migrant worker with his family, devoted his life to improving treatment and pay for farm workers.Chavezâs ambivalence over â and sometimes apparent outright disdain for â undocumented immigrants also is drawing attention via new published works such as a new biography whose author, journalist Miriam Pawel, says shows the icon as the complex person that he was.âItâs so complicated,â she said of Cesarâs handling of undocumented immigrants, in an interview with Fox News Latino. âThe border was very different then. There was no militarization of the border, people crossed the border every day, very easily.âChavez practically lived â and even risked his health â to improve life for U.S. farm workers. He pushed and pushed to persuade reluctant workers to unionize. He launched boycotts and labor strikes. He staged several hunger strikes, including one that lasted 25 days.His devotion, some say, led to an overzealous approach to those he perceived as undermining U.S. workers.âHe had very strong feelings about undocumented immigrants,â Pawel said.âHe launched the âIllegals Campaignâ in 1974, it was in the context of strike breakers and easy availability of people who were brought across the border [by U.S. employers] to replace striking workers.âChavezâs cousin, Manuel, started what was known as the âwet line,â a series of tents along a 25-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexican border along Arizona where some 300 members of what was then the United Farm Workers Union patrolled â to keep would-be border crossers out.âOstensibly, the âwet lineâ existed to strengthen a citrus strike in the Yuma lemon groves by convincing Mexicans who might work as scabs to turn around and stay home,â Pawel wrote in her book.But the patrols went beyond just monitoring the border for people who might be crossing illegally to replace striking workers, Pawel said.âStories had begun to surface about widespread violence and beatings along the âwet line,ââ she said. There were also many reports, she said, of UFW members stealing from people crossing the border.Pawel said that when confronted at the time about the reports of abuse by âwet lineâ patrols, Cesar Chavez denied knowing about it or condoning it.But, she wrote, âthe willingness of illegal immigrants to voluntarily report crimes to U.S. authorities, generally unsympathetic to the migrantsâ status, reflected the severity of the violence.âA judge who sentenced two UFW members to probation said: âThere is no justification for stopping these people, robbing them, beating them and throwing them back across the line,â Pawel wrote in her new book.Pawel and others say that Cesar Chavez did direct union members to seek out suspected undocumented immigrants and report them to immigration officials.âThey found workers in fields all over Fresnoâ for instance, she said, âand reported them to [immigration officials].Chavez granted an interview to KQED, the National Public Radio station in San Francisco, in which he expressed his disapproval of âwetbacksâ who worked as scabs, and undermined U.S. workers.Many unions, in fact, had strong objections to undocumented immigrants, seeing them as threats to American workers and their organizing efforts. Later, when their memberships began dwindling, they grew more supportive of immigration, and now many unions are at the forefront of pushing for laws that would help legalize undocumented workers.Pawel said that for his part, Chavez had misgivings over immigrants in general.âHe was very wary of them,â she said, viewing them as not sharing his values âabout what workers should want and aspire to.âChavez felt that workers should strive to live comfortable lives, but not be greedy and forget their communities or the plight of laborers.âHe felt that immigrants came just to make money,â she said, âand he had a real problem with it.âAt one time, Pawelâs book said, his comrade-in-arms, Dolores Huerta, who helped found the United Farm Workers Union with him, objected to the use of âwetbackâ and âillegal,â saying some people found those terms offensive.âChavez turned on Huerta angrily,â Pawel wrote. âNo, a spadeâs a spade,â her book quoted him as saying, âYou guys get these hang-ups. Goddamn it, how do we build a union? Theyâre wets, you know. Theyâre wets, and letâs go after them.âIn an interview with the Huffington Post last year, Huerta defended Chavez, saying the UFW helped undocumented immigrants fill out paperwork, and helped develop the 1986 amnesty that President Ronald Reagan signed into law. Almost three million people obtained amnesty through that program.Huertaâs not the only one coming to Chavezâs defense, essentially arguing that his stance on illegal immigration did not overshadow his overall impact on Hispanic civil rights.Jaime P. Martinez, founder and president of the Cesar E. Chavez Legacy and Educational Foundation in San Antonio, Texas, recalled the labor rights legend as a humble and big-hearted person who helped undocumented immigrants.âHe was a great humanitarian,â Martinez, who marched alongside Chavez, told Fox News Latino. âHe felt about undocumented immigrants the way advocates feel right now. He fought for the poor, the disenfranchised.âChavez did get upset, he said, over the strike-breakers brought over by growers who did not want to improve working conditions for U.S. workers.But Chavezâs union, Martinez insisted, was supportive of all Hispanics looking to improve their lot, including undocumented immigrants.âThere were people on strike who were undocumented,â he said. âHe was a unique and humble leader. He was a strong believer in the principles of non-violence. He had to preserve the strike. But he was not against undocumented immigrants.â Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Si, Se Pudo: Film About Chicano Leader Cesar Chavez Gets White House Screening Diego Luna’s historical biopic of labor activist Cesar Chavez has been making the rounds at various film festivals in preparation of his theatrical release next week.Now, fresh off its Audience Award win at last week’s South By Southwest festival, “Cesar Chavez” will be screened at the White House on Wednesday.The Mexican actor/director joked to The Wrap that he would tell President Barack Obama – should he get a moment with him – to tweet about the film, “because he has more followers than all of us together.”“But I really hope that this film raised awareness on the situation today in the fields. This struggle keeps happening,” Luna continued. “The struggle and fight of these people is still so much alive, and they deserve attention. Hopefully this film can draw attention, not just to farm workers but to all of those workers that today are feeding the country, that are building this country that deserve immigration reform.”“Cesar Chavez” tells the story of famed Mexican-American labor leader’s fight to unionize farm workers in California. Chavez, who founded the United Farm Workers of America, fought to win better pay and conditions for the laborers picking grapes in the fields.“There’s more than 11 million workers today that are making America what it is and don’t share the same rights as those who are consuming the products or of those who are enjoying the fruits of their labor,” Luna told The Wrap.Michael Peña (“American Hustle”) plays Chavez in the film, while American Ferrera (“Ugly Betty”) plays his wife. Rosario Dawson (“Sin City”) portrays Chavez’s ally and labor leader union leader Dolores Huerta. Luna, Ferrera and Dawson are in Washington and expected to attend the event.The film was already screened in the nation’s capital at an event on Capitol Hill in February. The screening Wednesday will take place at the South Court Auditorium at 2:25 p.m.In 2010, President Obama proclaimed March 31 as Cesar Chavez Day. The film opens in theaters on March 28.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Charges reduced for clash with police officer, Ecuadorian immigrant hopes to stay in US HARTFORD, Conn. –  An Ecuadorian immigrant facing possible deportation said Wednesday he hopes to be allowed to stay in the United States after a court removed a felony conviction stemming from a clash with a now-disgraced Connecticut police officer.Edgar Marin, 32, was allowed to plead guilty to Monday to reduced charges related to his encounter with Officer Dennis Spaulding, who was among four East Haven officers arrested in a scandal over police abuse of Latinos.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTMarin, a legal U.S. resident, struck a plea agreement in 2011 that led to his conviction on a charge of assaulting an officer. He was sentenced to two years' probation and then, in January, U.S. immigration agents detained him and moved to return him to Ecuador on grounds that he was a convicted felon."They never told me this was going to be a consequence," said Marin, who was released on bond from detention last week.In an effort to prevent deportation, Marin's lawyers said the charges should be reduced, arguing that Spaulding has been discredited by his criminal conviction. Defense lawyer David Forsythe said prosecutors cooperated with the request. On Monday, Marin was allowed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge of interference with an officer.Prosecutors did not respond to requests for comment.Marin was arrested in June 2011 as police tried to tow his car following an accident. Marin said Spaulding used racially charged language as he blocked Marin from getting tools out of the car. Marin said he tried to stop the car from being towed, Spaulding pushed him and broke his wrist, and it was then that Marin pushed Spaulding. But an attorney for Spaulding said witnesses backed up his account that Marin was the aggressor.Spaulding, who was arrested by the FBI in January 2012, was sentenced in January to five years in prison for conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of Hispanics, making false arrests and using unreasonable force. Marin was not among those to testify against him at trial.Frank Riccio, an attorney for Spaulding, said the episode reflected a history of bad blood between his client and the Marin family, including a cousin who testified against Spaulding. Riccio said he understands that a case is weakened when a key witness is convicted of a crime but he said Spaulding would not agree that he was discredited.Marin, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador 14 years ago, said that during his six-week detention his 6-year-old son was told that he was away working because he did not want him to know he was behind bars.His immigration lawyer, Yale Law School student Elliot Friedman, said he hopes deportation proceedings will be stopped at his next hearing on May 6."It is morally and legally incorrect for Edgar to be in this position and threatened with deportation," Friedman said. 
Cheers And Jeers For Speaker For Closing The Window On Immigration Vote House Speaker John Boehnerâs announcement Wednesday that his chamber would not deal with comprehensive immigration reform in what remains of the current congressional session drew cheers from conservatives and criticism from those who want to give undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status.Republicans appeared to interpret Boehnerâs statement as a sign that the House would focus on beefing up border security and interior enforcement.âThe Speakerâs decision clears the way for the House to pursue targeted immigration bills designed to protect and enhance the interests of the American people,â said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors strict immigration policies.âThere is universal agreement that we must secure our borders, prevent people from overstaying their visas, and implement a universal worker verification system that protects American jobs.âIn June, the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that included provisions for increasing the number of border patrol agents, expanding foreign worker visas and providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a particular set of criteria.In the House, where Republicans hold the majority, conservatives have vowed not to rubber-stamp the Senate's version, or approve any bill that includes a path to legal status for those who are here illegally. Many Republicans in the House prefer a step-by-step approach to immigration reform, with an emphasis on enforcement.âThere is no reason why Congress cannot make progress on these popular and necessary measures as we move into an election year,â Stein said. âAs the House moves forward with its piecemeal approach, it is also important that leadership rejects amnesty and massive increases in immigration.âAdvocates of more lenient immigration laws assailed Boehner, an Ohio Republican, and vowed not to stop pressing for a path to legal status."No doubt House Speaker Boehner and GOP Whip McCarthy did not get the memo,â said Angelica Salas, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or CHIRLA. âThe bells for immigration reform will toll only and when millions of undocumented workers living in the U.S. win an opportunity to emerge from the shadows that keep them from becoming full contributors to our nation's progress."AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the speaker had kowtowed to the most conservative members of his party. He said Boehner should have worked to bring a House immigration reform measure, HR 15, that has bipartisan support to a vote.âIt is clear from Boehnerâs decision that a minority of anti-immigrant House Republicans holds the power, and are preventing a solution to one of our nationâs most pressing problems,â Trumka said. âIn fact, if the bipartisan House bill HR 15 was put before the House today, it would no doubt pass.ââThe AFL-CIO will not give up this fight until comprehensive immigration reform is passed in the Congress,â Trumka said.NumbersUSA head Roy Beck, who has been a major force in blocking immigration reform efforts, claimed credit and said he would not rest on his laurels. He thanked supporters of his group for bombarding Boehner and other Republicans with phone calls and emails.âYou have done this primarily by telling your own U.S. representative why that promise would be so important to America's struggling workers,â Beck said in an email, âwhy it is so important that Congress not give lifetime work permits to 11 million illegal aliens and to more than 20 million other foreign citizens over the next ten years.â"The pressure on Boehner has worked well," the message continued, "as he has steadily backed farther away from some of the bold statements he made earlier in the year about wanting to pass big immigration legislation this year.âElizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Civil Rights Act anniversary: Congress should learn from our four living presidents U.S President Lyndon Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as Martin Luther King Jr. and others watch in the White House East Room, Washington, D.C.APFifty years later we are locked in a time of deep political division in America, frustrated by a Congress that can’t deal with a national immigration crisis, protect the right to vote or even pass a jobs bill to help the struggling economy.But this Thursday, four presidents – Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter – will stand together at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe historical significance of this moment cannot be overstated. The presidents will come together as a powerful symbol of America’s ability, as demonstrated 50 years ago, to do what it takes to solve the most painfully difficult national problems.The presidents will gather to honor the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. They will be there out of respect for the leadership of President Johnson, a white, Southern president who put his political future on the line to sign the bill. And they will be calling attention to the mix of Republicans and Democrats who also put their political best interests to the side to heal a deep racial wound and change the nation.With the current Congress, it defies political reality to imagine that 50 years ago it was possible for two conservative white Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Ohio Rep. William McCulloch, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, to work with Democrats. They had support as well from liberal Republican Sen. Jacob Javits of New York to make a deal with the leader of the opposing party, President Johnson, and make history.Who today can believe that the House passed the controversial bill first, with 153 Democrats and 136 Republicans voting ‘Yes’? The bill was tied up in the Senate by the obstructionist tactics of white segregationists for four months. It was Republicans who pushed the bill over the line; it would not have passed without their votes.The pressures on President Johnson, the Congress and the nation 50 years ago make today’s politics and arguments over spending and immigration seem tame.In 1964, the prior century of American history added to the intensity of the political drama.In 1863, 100 years earlier, President Lincoln, the founder of the modern Republican Party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation to free the slaves. It took an amendment to the Constitution – the 13th – to abolish slavery. But a hundred years later, black Americans still did not have equal rights. Segregation and second-class treatment of blacks had become the law, and they were celebrated by some as tradition.When President Kennedy introduced a civil rights bill in June of 1963, he said he was asking Congress to deal with an urgent “moral” and racial crisis that couldn’t be handled by police, street demonstrations or “token moves or talk.” The young president said it was “time to act in the Congress” by enacting “legislation giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public – hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores… this seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure…”The president added: “A great change is at hand … our obligation is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all.”Kennedy acted under pressure for immediate action to deal with rage and the potential for violence after Alabama’s governor, George Wallace, a Democrat, personally blocked a door to the registrar’s office at the University of Alabama to prevent two black students from signing up for classes. There had been protest marches in Birmingham in which dogs and fire hoses were turned on peaceful demonstrators.The civil rights movement of the 1960s featured violent confrontations with Southern segregationists, many of them Democrats. On the Republican side, leading voices, including the party’s 1964 presidential nominee, Sen. Barry Goldwater, opposed the civil rights bill to play to white racial resentments.These dynamics produced a racial crisis across the nation. Troops were stationed around the nation’s capital when civil rights leaders led the March on Washington in August of 1963. The next month, four black girls were killed in a Birmingham church by a bomb planted by white racists. But five days after President Kennedy was assassinated in November of 1963, President Johnson told a joint session of Congress:“No memorial or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought. We have talked for one hundred years or more,” he said, referring back to the Civil War. “Yes, it is time now to write the next chapter – and to write it in the book of law.”America’s white church leaders did not dodge the politics of the racial crisis. As represented by the National Council of Churches they joined with black Christian leaders, including Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as Jewish leaders to take a political stand and back the bill. It took four difficult months for the Senate to pass the bill.President Johnson, just months away from a November election in which he knew the bill would be used against him, signed it into law in June of 1964. He was later reported to have said the bill would cost his party the Southern vote for a generation.A new book by Todd Purdum – “An Idea Whose Time Has Come, Two Presidents, Two Parties, and the Battle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964” – tells the story of a note sent by Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of the slain president, to Congressman McCulloch after he retired. She thanked him for the “shining gift of your nobility,” and for taking the spotlight away from her husband and President Johnson. She told the Republican: “I know that you, more than anyone, were responsible for the civil rights legislation.”Four presidents, one Republican and three Democrats, will stand together at the Johnson Library this week to celebrate a past achievement.Let’s hope the current Congress gets the message.Juan Williams joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 as a contributor and is also a co-host of FNC's "The Five," where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

Colorado School District Hires DREAMer Teachers Under New Policy DENVER (AP) –  Colorado's largest school district sees teaching potential among immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally when they were children.They are people like Kareli Lizarraga, a 22-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate who grew up in California and Arizona after her parents brought her to this country from Mexico when she was 4.Lizarraga, who is finishing her first year as a reading teacher for seventh-graders in Denver, told The Associated Press on Friday that she still remembers feeling shocked that she could not communicate when she first arrived in the United States. And, even more vividly, she recalls a Spanish-speaking teacher who reached out to help.Denver Public Schools Superintendent Tom Boasberg said his district began reaching out to what he saw as a talent pool soon after President Barack Obama took steps last year to allow young people living in the U.S. illegally to stay and work. Lizarraga is one of two teachers who qualified under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and started work in Denver this school year. Boasberg said more will be hired this coming year."Anything that touches on immigration generates a level of attention and controversy," Boasberg told the AP. "But for us, this is about finding the very best teachers for our kids."Fred Elbel, director of the Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform, told the AP his organization questioned whether the project was fair to other job seekers, and whether sufficient emphasis was being placed on teaching students English.Antonio Mercado, an actor, director, theater professor and former Denver public high school teacher, said the district would likely face backlash from job seekers and veteran teachers, as well as from groups like Elbel's."It is a risk," Mercado said. "But what it means is (district officials) care about a huge population of their students."Mercado recently brought a production exploring the issues faced by children who immigrated illegally to a Denver school. After performances, he said, several students who had seen the show spoke about seeing their parents deported in recent weeks. That experience, he said, underlined the importance of having people in the classrooms who can talk about such issues.A grant from Ben and Lucy Ana Walton has helped fund the hires through Teach for America, Boasberg said.Lizarraga said she first contacted Teach for America during her junior year at Penn, but could not pursue a position because she lacked a Social Security card. That changed just as she was graduating thanks to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.She laughs when she recalls surprised reactions in her class when she told her students she spoke Spanish. She said her language skills help her communicate with parents, allowing her to work with them to show their children that "together, we really care about you."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Complex Medicaid And Medicare Eligibility Issues Mired In Controversial Immigration Debate People typically mix up Medicare and Medicaid, the former guarantees access to health care insurance for senior citizens, while the latter provides health care to low-income families.As if that's complicated enough, the fact that both programs are now getting entangled in the ever-thorny national immigration debate is likely to muddy the waters even more.In its latest budget proposal unveiled Tuesday, the Obama administration is attempting to crack down on older people in the country illegally who are improperly receiving Medicare benefits. Even if they've worked and paid taxes, the government isn’t supposed to pay the medical bills of undocumented immigrants.Daniel R. Levinson, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, told the New York Times this week that having undocumented  immigrants “involuntarily disenrolled” will save $67 million over the next five years.The administration also wants to reduce Medicare payments to nursing homes and home health agencies, which generally have higher profit margins than doctors and hospitals do.But a potentially more explosive issue, politically, is playing out in states that declined to expand their Medicaid coverage.Legal immigrants to the United States whose income is under the federal poverty level – $11,400 for individuals and $19,530 for a family of three – have to wait five years before they can enroll in Medicaid, so the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, grants them subsidies to sign up through the state and federal health care marketplaces.Trouble is, U.S. citizens don’t get that discount made available to legal immigrants.Under Obamacare, they would qualify for Medicaid instead, but not necessarily in the dozen states that opted out of the expanded Medicaid provision.In Florida, for instance, according to the Miami Herald, the Medicaid cutoff for a family of three is 38 percent of the poverty level ($7,421), and no low-income non-parent qualifies.“It doesn’t matter where you are on the immigration issue,” Republican state senator Rene García from Hialeah told the Herald. “It’s a fairness issue.”Garcia introduced a bill into the Florida senate to reverse course and accept Medicaid expansion. Similar measures are being introduced in Arkansas and Iowa.In Arizona, the Republican governor, Jan Brewer, a vociferous opponent of Obamacare, opted to accept the Medicaid expansion last year. According to documents obtained by the Associated Press, the decision was based at least in part because she was alerted by budget advisers to the fact that “only legal immigrants, but not citizens [below the federal poverty line] would be eligible for subsidies.”“Very few are aware of that component of the law,” Florida state senator García told the Herald. “When they realize it is there, it may change some mindsets.”Not everyone agrees.“It’s hard to see there would be any traction for anyone on this issue,” Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told the newspaper. “There’s a lot of sensitivity, not just about immigration but there is also an element of racial issues and discrimination.”Critics of the expansion argue that the federal government will stop paying 100 percent of the Medicaid payments after three years, leaving states in an impossible financial situation.And the bugs that have afflicted healthcare.gov, the online portal for Obamacare, are also contributing to the problem.“If you are in a non-expansion state,” Shelby Gonzales, senior policy analyst with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said, “[the website] will say you are not eligible for Medicaid or the subsidies.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Congressman Labrador Warns: If Speaker Boehner Takes Up Immigration, He Should Be Out Of A Job Congressman Raul Labrador does not have the high-profile firebrand image of say, his fellow Republican in the Senate, Texan Ted Cruz.But the Idaho lawmaker is no less hesitant about calling it as he sees it, even when it means taking on his own party, including the leadership.In an interview with Roll Call, a political publication, Labrador said that the Republican Party is adrift on many issues – chief among them, he noted, immigration.And he blamed House Republican Speaker, Ohio's John Boehner, who has suggested that he will bring immigration reform for a vote – likely through separate bills dealing with different aspects – some time this year.Under Boehner’s direction, House GOP leaders recently released what they called “immigration principles” that included support for giving certain undocumented immigrants a path to legal status, as well as tightening the border.Labrador, who in the past has objected to giving undocumented immigrants any kind of break, said it would be a mistake to tackle immigration this year.“I think it should cost him his speakership,” said Labrador, referring to Boehner.Echoing a growing chorus of Republicans who’ve discussed the odds of immigration reform moving in Congress this year, Labrador said President Obama could not be trusted to abide by any part of a law that required stepping up enforcement.“The problem that we have right now is that Republicans and the American public don’t trust this president to actually enforce the law,” he said, according to Roll Call. “It’s the lack of trust that is killing us right now.”Last June, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill that included tightening border security, interior enforcement, making mandatory a system that employers can use to verify a worker’s eligibility, expanding foreign worker visas, and providing a path to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants.Many of the most conservative members of the House, however, refused to sanction any measure that gives undocumented immigrants a chance to get legal status. Many of them see this as “amnesty.”National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon raised the possibility recently that perhaps it would be wise to deal with immigration after GOP primaries.“That’s such an evil way of doing legislation,” Labrador said.“To actually openly admit that what you’re going to do is pull the wool over people’s eyes,” he said, “I think that’s offensive. And that’s not what I’m for. That’s not why I came here to Washington, D.C. And it saddens me that my own party thinks that it’s OK to do that.”He didn’t discount immigration for good. He said 2015 might be a better year for it.Labrador has been nudging his party to get back to conservative stances. He sees Boehner as a leader who has helped the move away from its conservative base.“There is a hunger in the conference for bold, visionary leaders, and this is not just conservatives — you talk to more middle-of-the-road members of the conference, they’re kind of frustrated with the direction of this leadership, and they’re looking for ways to change that,” he said, according to Roll Call.“I think you’re going to see some changes here in the House over the next year,” he said. “I think that this is an opportunity for whoever wants to run for leadership to show that they have a clear vision for America.”While the congressman would not say that he was offering himself as a better potential speaker, he did not rule out entertaining the idea, the publication said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Congress must move forward on immigration reform  The past 10 days have been a roller coaster for evangelical Christians and other conservative Americans who are convinced that our nation’s immigration laws are woefully in need of reform.On Jan. 30, the House Republican leadership released a set of pragmatic standards for immigration reform rooted in conservative values. Evangelical leaders nationally and locally applauded: The House GOP Standards for Immigration Reform closely mirror the Evangelical Statement of Principles for Immigration Reform endorsed by hundreds of nationally prominent Christian leaders in the past two years.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe principles include a commitment to secure borders and an approach to those immigrants who have violated the law that reconciles a healthy respect for the rule of law and a compassionate approach to people made in God’s image, avoiding the irrational extremes of either amnesty or mass deportation.Just a week later, though, media reports have suggested that some of those who have in the past been strong proponents of reform consistent with these standards are now arguing—primarily for political, not principled reasons— that House Leadership should under no circumstance seek to tackle immigration reform in 2014.We’ve both spent enough time in Washington, D.C., to know that doublespeak is part of political parlance. Many of the local pastors from all corners of the country who have come to the Capitol to advocate for immigration reform in the past year, though, have been disillusioned as they hear elected officials say one thing about the need for reform in a private meeting only to read something rather different quoted in the newspaper.Some of our elected officials might do well to heed Jesus’ words to “let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’”Getting to “Yes” on immigration reform this year is urgent for many reasons. We need a system that restores the rule of law, that secures our borders, that jumpstarts economic growth, and that keeps families—including many within our local churches—from being divided.As social conservatives keenly aware of the importance that the president—and his or her appointees to the Supreme Court—can play in determining key questions for proponents of religious liberty, traditional marriage, and the pro-life cause, there’s another critical reason that House Republicans must get to “Yes” this year. As many within the GOP have acknowledged, it is nearly impossible to win the Electoral College unless a Republican candidate significantly outperforms Governor Romney’s 27 percent of the Latino vote.While immigration is not the only concern of Latino voters, it is, as columnist Michael Gerson recently noted, the “threshold” to winning Latino votes. If we are to have another pro-life president, the socially conservative party must address immigration. As Senator John Cornyn, who hails from a red state where 30 percent of eligible voters are Latino, recently observed, “We can't win in 2016 without resolving it.”If tackling immigration reform is deferred to 2015, though, the presidential primary jockeying will begin, drawing out the shrillest anti-immigration voices from the fringes of the GOP and likely pushing the dialogue further and further from the reasonable reforms that most Republican voters and most Republican elected officials believe are ultimately the best for our country. Past 2014, the window of opportunity to finally pass reform begins to close.If we are to have a Republican president elected in 2016, we need immigration reform—and we need it this year.Ultimately, though, the reasons our leaders in the House of Representatives should get to “Yes” on immigration reform are not political, they are moral. “The time is always right,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “to do what is right.” We take our cues from Scripture, which makes clear both that we are to welcome and extend hospitality to immigrants and that we ought to respect and honor the law. Our current immigration quagmire fails on both counts.Evangelical Christians, who make up nearly half of Republican primary voters, are looking for candidates who share their biblical values, including biblically informed commitments to caring for immigrants and restoring the rule of law. Poll after poll finds that a majority of white evangelicals (and an even larger majority of Hispanic evangelicals) support immigration reforms consistent with the Standards that House Republican Leaders laid out last week.Across the country, we are praying that Congress will have the courage to do what is right: to get to “Yes” on immigration this year. Right now, House Republicans have a window to develop immigration reform that honors and promotes conservative values: a more secure border, a stronger economy, respect for the rule of law, and an earned legalization program that emphasizes accountability.But that opportunity will not last forever. The time is now.Rev. Samuel Rodriguez is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and Mat Staver is chairman of the Liberty Counsel and Dean of the Liberty University Law School. 
Congress returns to Capitol Hill with full agenda, but limited desire to make big changes in election year FILE: Sept. 15, 2013: The U.S. Capitol dome in Washington, D.C.APMembers of Congress return to Capitol Hill on Monday following a two-week recess -- ready to resume negotiations on immigration reform, a minimum-wage bill and other key legislation -- but with little possibility of agreeing on any major changes in an election year.While members will almost assuredly pass a measure to avoid a government shutdown, and the wrath of voters, bills on increasing the federal minimum wage, reforming immigration laws and fixing the tax code are not expected to get a final vote in either the Republican-controlled House or the Democrat-led Senate.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAll 435 House seats and 36 Senate seats are up for re-election in November, which has leaders of both parties cautious about holding votes on any legislation that could force members to make a difficult choice.Such a scenario is more likely in the Senate where several incumbent Democrats are facing tough re-election bids, with Republicans needing to win a net six seats to take control of the upper chamber.The GOP is expected to keep control of the House.Atop Congress’ must-do list is pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government running past the Oct. 1, which is the start of the new budget year. However, votes aren't needed until September.After largely being blamed for the partial government shutdown last fall, Republicans are not expected to allow such a situation to happen again.However, passing the second big item on the list will be more difficult -- finding more money for the Highway Trust Fund to keep afloat road- and bridge-construction projects.The fund is running critically low on cash. The Obama administration says that could mean a slowdown in construction projects this summer and fall when lawmakers are back home asking voters to return them to Washington for another term. The current highway bill expires at the end of September."The number of (must-do) items is small," said GOP lobbyist Hazen Marshall of the Nickles Group. "But the degree of difficulty, particularly for the highway bill, is very high."Though top lawmakers and administration officials say they want to pass a multiyear highway and transit funding bill, most political observers think a temporary extension of funding is far more likely. But that's still complicated.Passing the two bills is probably all that will happen before Election Day.Congress has already increased the debt limit and fixed Medicare's flawed payment formula, which should leave time for members to get the troubled appropriations process back on track in the aftermath of last year's shutdown and modest follow-up budget bargain.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has promised the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a few weeks of floor time, after the upper chamber failed last year to pass a single appropriations bill.The House will try to pass as many of its12 spending bills as it can. But the process is expected to be difficult for bills to fund the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and to implement ObamaCare.In the Senate, Democrats scrambling to retain control of the chamber will stage votes to raise the minimum wage and help the middle class with rising costs for college and child care.In addition, liberals such as Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tea Party lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, want to end lengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.In the House, additional votes to repeal parts of President Obama's health law are assured. And Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced Friday that the lower chamber will soon pass legislation to help charter schools.The biggest wildcard is perhaps immigration-reform legislation. The Senate last summer passed a comprehensive bill that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. House leadership has expressed a desire to pass reform legislation but only a measure that would give legal status to such immigrants.Though observers say such legislation is all but dead, House Speaker John Boehner continues to say he wants to pass a bill, even discussing the issue in his home state of Ohio over the Easter break.The House has passed legislation aimed at forcing the administration to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline running from Canada to Texas and bills to ease environmental regulations that GOP lawmakers say destroy jobs.And GOP House leaders are again developing legislation to replace ObamaCare, but there's no guarantee it ever will be completed or see a vote.Must-do items are few and far between.Legislation to renew tax breaks collectively known as "extenders" qualifies in most people's minds but can wait until the session after the November elections.The leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees, both of whom are retiring at the end of the term, will make sure to keep intact the five-decade streak of successful enactment of the annual defense policy measure.Another must-do item is renewing a federal program that backstops the market for private terrorism insurance. The program, created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, expires at the end of the year. Its renewal is eagerly sought by the insurance industry and large commercial interests like real estate developers and hotel chains.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Court Ruling Spurs Halt On Immigration Detainers, Keeping People In Jail For Deportation Consideration PORTLAND, Ore. –  A federal judge in Oregon has found that an immigrant woman's constitutional rights were violated when she was held in jail without probable cause at the request of U.S. immigration authorities, one of several recent federal court decisions to scrutinize the practice of keeping people in jail after they're eligible for release so that they can be considered for deportation.The rulings make it clear that local officials are not required to honor immigration authorities' requests that someone in custody continue to be held even though their original charges were resolved or they are eligible for bail, and that local jurisdictions may be held liable for doing so.The rulings have spurred several jurisdictions — from multiple Oregon counties to the city of Philadelphia — to announce they will no longer honor requests for such holds. Previously, some counties and states had already limited use of the practice, arguing it is expensive, erodes immigrants' trust in law enforcement, and drags people with minor infractions such as traffic violations into deportation."This will undoubtedly improve the relationship between each of these offices and the immigrant and refugee communities," said Carmen Madrid, an organizer with the Portland-based nonprofit Center for Intercultural Organizing.The decisions come as immigration reform has stalled and the Obama administration is being criticized for deporting mostly people who have not committed a serious crime — despite its stance to focus on dangerous criminals.Requests that an immigrant be held are sent to local law enforcement by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The agency knows who is being booked into local jails because of an information-sharing partnership between ICE, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local jurisdictions.The notices request that the person be jailed for an extra two days, excluding weekends and holidays, so that ICE can initiate an investigation and take the person into custody.But immigrant rights advocates say ICE has made mistakes in the past, incarcerating U.S. citizens, people who have not committed any crimes, or those arrested on misdemeanors."They do it in a dragnet manner without first doing the investigation upfront, sometimes before a local district attorney has even signed off on the charges. So it results in the unjust incarceration of a lot of people who are not deportable at all, or who are not found guilty in the criminal process," said Kate Desormeau, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.In recent years, California, Connecticut and more than a dozen jurisdictions around the country have stopped or limited their compliance with the so-called immigration detainer requests. Lawmakers in Massachusetts and Maryland are considering similar legislation. On Wednesday, the mayor of Philadelphia signed an executive order limiting the use of such holds.ICE has said that the requests are optional. The detainers generally are not accompanied with a warrant.But many local law enforcement agencies say they have treated them as orders because the requests cite federal regulation, which states that a law enforcement agency "shall maintain custody of an alien" once a detainer request has been issued."The fact that the detainers contain both language of request and command has led to conflicting interpretations as to whether the immigration detainers provide legal authority for the continued custody of the people named in the detainers," Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts wrote in a letter announcing the suspension in the use of detainers.Roberts changed his policy after a U.S. District Court judge last Friday found the detainers are "requests" that do not provide the necessary legal basis for the jail to hold a person in custody after charges are resolved — and consequently, that in March 2012, the county violated Maria Miranda-Olivares' rights under the 4th Amendment by prolonging her incarceration without probable cause.The woman, who was found guilty of contempt of court and sentenced to 48 hours in jail, was incarcerated for more than two weeks due to the ICE hold, even though she was eligible for pre-trial release upon posting bail and after her release from state charges. A hearing will determine how much the county must pay Miranda-Olivares in damages.The ruling has led sheriffs in Oregon's Multnomah, Washington, Marion and Deschutes counties to suspend the use of immigration holds. The regional jail that serves Hood River, Wasco, Gilliam, and Sherman counties will also no longer comply with ICE detainer requests.The Clackamas County case follows a similar case in Philadelphia, where the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that state and local law enforcement authorities are not required to comply with requests from ICE to hold people on detainers without probable cause. The ruling, which involved a U.S. citizen, also recognized that states and localities may share liability when they participate in such detentions.And in another case in Rhode Island involving a naturalized U.S. citizen, the district court issued a decision reaffirming that detainers don't justify warrantless imprisonment and allowed the immigrant's lawsuit against federal and state defendants to proceed."These rulings have dispelled any lingering uncertainty on whether localities can say no to ICE detainers," Desormeau said. "So jurisdictions that have been sitting on the sidelines may now act to limit their use. Otherwise, they're inviting legal liability."Based on reporting by the Associated Press. 
EXCLUSIVE: Cuban Wanted In 2.8M Heist Could Avoid U.S. Jail Time Due To Red Tape It looks like Raonel Valdez may once again escape the long arm of the law.The Cuban fugitive, wanted in the United States for allegedly participating in a $2.8 million gold heist, avoided stiff jail time while carrying out a series of bold crimes in the U.S. before fleeing into the Caribbean on a stolen 30-foot speedboat in December 2012. Valdez was picked up by local authorities at Belizeâs border with Guatemala earlier this year. Since then, he has been held at Hattieville Prison in Belize City while awaiting extradition to the U.S.The problem, however, is that two federal agencies canât seem to agree whether or not Valdez should be brought to justice here.The U.S. Marshals Service, who took the lead in the investigation after Valdez fled the country, wants the fugitive shipped back to Florida, but officials at the Department of Homeland Security have yet to sign Valdezâs parole letter permitting a suspected criminal to be brought into the country.âThe Marshals Service used many domestic and international investigative resources to locate Valdez ultimately in Belize and has requested that DHS' Homeland Security Investigations approve parole of Valdez back into the U.S. to face justice in the alleged armed robbery case,â Drew Wade, a spokesperson for the Marshals Service said in a statement to Fox News Latino.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who is handling the matter as part of the DHS, acknowledged that it has received the request and was reviewing the situation, but gave no answer for the delay on why the agency has not singed the parole letter for Valdez. âU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations has received the request and has not made a decision," Barbara Gonzalez, a spokesperson for ICE, told FNL in an email. "ICE is currently working with the U.S. Marshals Service and ICE is reviewing the request."The seemingly counterproductive work between the two federal agencies is common in law enforcement, Tom Raffanello, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent and current private investigator told FNL.âItâs just part of the overall normal malady in law enforcement bureaucracy today,â he said. âItâs all politics.âThe office of U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) told FNL that it had already contacted both the DHS and the State Department to get information about Valdez's case but had not received any word on what was causing the delay in his parole letter. "We're looking for answers," Debbie Zimmerman, the congresswoman's district chief of staff told FNL. "They've got a reason why they're delaying this issue right now, but we're not sure what it is."Valdez came to the U.S. in 2005, quickly obtaining a Social Security card and driverâs license in Florida thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants undocumented immigrants from the island who reach U.S. soil nearly-guaranteed legal status. Soon afterward, Valdez began a career in crime.He earned his first criminal charge in June 2007 when he was busted for possession of marijuana. He was soon paroled and, the next year, cops found 85 grams of methamphetamine under the hood of his car. In July 2008, Valdez was arrested again. This time for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for attacking security guards while trying to steal an $18 pair of garden shears Home Depot.Valdez then jumped his bail and fled to Mexico, where he soon ran afoul of authorities and was arrested on charges of human smuggling for taking people from Cuba to Mexico.After he was recruited by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to help kidnap a high-ranking Zetas drug cartel member â an attempt that failed because they wound up netting the wrong guy. Valdez wound up back in Miami where U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested him at Miami International Airport for missing a 2008 court date.While Florida Judge Victoria Brennan let him walk free for time served, Valdez soon racked a string of offenses in the next year, including another drug possession charge for operating a Miami marijuana growing operation, abusing the mother of his 2-year-old daughter and getting slapped with a felony armed robbery charge that earned him a GPS tracker.Then came the armed gold heist that netted 110 pounds of gold flakes â valued at nearly $3 million â from an unsuspecting, sickly courier, George Villegas, who was on his way to deliver the precious metals to a refinery.A GPS tracker on his ankle showed Valdez casing an apartment complex where he allegedly swiped the gold off of Villegas. It showed when he entered the building and followed him for five days afterward as he peddled the gold to various pawn shops in Miami-Dade County and bought a girlfriend a 2008 Toyota Yaris, before the signal from the ankle monitor went dead, and Valdez disappeared from the map.With Valdez now back on the map and sitting in a jail in Belize, the decision on whether he will go on trial in the U.S. or serve out the remainder of his six month immigration sentence in Central America rests on the shoulders of officials in Washington.âThe Marshals donât have a dog in the fight right now,â Raffanello said. âRight now it all depends if somebody higher up calls DHS and put the pressure on them.âFollow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino     
David Leopold: Why Did Obama Devote Only 30 Seconds Of His Speech To Immigration Reform? A year ago today President Obama stood in the gym of Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada and laid out a four part plan to overhaul America’s antiquated, unworkable immigration system. The president focused on continuing to strengthen border security, cracking down on employers that hire unauthorized workers, creating a path to earned citizenship and streamlining our legal immigration system. Less than six months later Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate, after lengthy negotiations, hammered out and passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. The legislation was far from perfect, but it provided the House of Representatives with a “working draft” to improve upon.Or not.As we entered the final months of 2013 amid a chorus of impassioned pleas from a broad coalition of labor, business, and religious groups, including demonstrations against the continued deportations and an historic “Fast for Families” on the  National Mall, the House leadership failed to put immigration reform on the legislative agenda. Instead, the Nation was treated to a litany of lame excuses why the House could not vote on immigration reform including – my personal favorite – that the legislative calendar was too full (of course the legislative calendar was not a problem in 2005 when the House took only three days to consider and pass H.R. 4437, an infamous bill aimed at making millions of Latino immigrants into felons).- David LeopoldSo, it was nothing less than shocking Tuesday night that the President entered the House chamber to give the 2014 State of the Union address and not a single immigration reform bill has been put to a vote on the House floor. Is it any wonder President Obama devoted only 30 seconds of his speech to immigration reform? It clearly wasn’t because an overhaul is not a priority for the President — to the contrary, immigration reform is at the top of the administration’s 2014 legislative agenda. Rather, strategy seemed to dictate that Mr. Obama soft-pedal immigration in his address, to give the House GOP one last chance to act. Nevertheless, Mr. Obama, in 121 words, put the onus squarely on the shoulders of the House GOP by reminding them that immigration is essential to economic growth and job creation—something all Americans, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned about. It’s also true that Mr. Obama has already said what he is going to say about immigration reform. In addition to presenting his core reform principles a year ago, he has expressed strong support for the bipartisan Senate bill, and implored the House to pass an immigration reform —whether as a comprehensive package or in pieces. And he has done so with the full support of the American people –Republicans, Democrats and Independents – who support immigration reform, including a path to earned citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.To be sure some immigration advocates were disappointed that when Mr. Obama told Congress he would not hesitate to use his executive authority to “expand more opportunities for American families” he was not referring to immigration reform. As the House delays fixing the broken system, 1,100 immigrants are deported every day, tearing apart thousands of American families each year. The President and the Congress have a shared responsibility to end this tragedy.The real drama will unfold later this week when the GOP House leadership releases its Statement of Principles on immigration reform. Here is what we are waiting to find out: Is Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and the House leadership ready to stop dithering and get serious about reforming the badly broken immigration system? Or will they continue to kowtow to the extremists in their party by including unattainable benchmarks and conditions? Will the GOP Statement of Principles recognize that all credible economic studies – from the right-leaning CATO Institute to the left-leaning Center for American Progress – demonstrate that immigration reform, including a path to earned citizenship, will boost the U.S. economy, increase America’s global edge, and create jobs for U.S. workers? Will the GOP principles reflect that the current legal immigration system, an outdated bureaucratic process designed to fit the needs of America in the 1960s, cannot serve American families and businesses in the 21st century? Will the Republicans show they understand that the so-called “legal immigration line” is, in reality, a twisted path that often leads to nowhere? And, perhaps most importantly, will the House leadership support legalization with a path to earned citizenship for all aspiring Americans? Or will they offer a proposal that, for the first time in American history, creates a subclass of immigrants shut off from the American Dream?The time for Republican excuses is long past. It’s now time for action.David Leopold is the former national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and currently practices immigration law in Cleveland, Ohio.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino   
'Day Of Action' Rallies In Cities Across The U.S. Decry Deportations, Urge President To Act PHOENIX (AP) –  Immigration advocates and supporters rallied Saturday in cities across the country in a renewed effort to push President Barack Obama to put a freeze on deportations.Organizers of the more than 50 planned "Day of Action" demonstrations said Obama has the executive power to stop deportations that separate immigrants living in the country illegally from their loved ones.In Eloy, Ariz., more than 100 supporters converged in front of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after journeying more than 60 miles from Phoenix.Natally Cruz, an organizer with the grassroots group Puente Arizona, said many of the people in attendance have relatives who have been inside the facility for more than a year."We want President Obama and his administration to really hear our community members across the country, to understand we do not want one more person separated," said Cruz, who entered the U.S. at age 8 illegally with her parents. "One family every night goes to bed missing somebody in their family."Many walked with signs saying "Not 1 More Deportation" and calling for deferred deportation action for all. The group included a woman whose son has been in the Eloy Detention Center for nearly three years and a woman who was arrested at her work and detained for two months, the group said.The Eloy Police Department had about five officers monitoring the rally. Sgt. Brian Jerome said the demonstration was relatively peaceful with no arrests.Amber Cargile, an ICE spokeswoman in Phoenix, said the agency respects the rights of people to protest outside its facilities."While we continue to work with Congress to enact commonsense immigration reform, ICE remains committed to sensible, effective immigration enforcement that focuses on its priorities, including convicted criminals and those apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States," Cargile said.More than 50 people, including families with children, stood in front of a federal immigration office in New York City. Among them was 47-year-old Humayun Chowdhury, a cab driver who said his family suffered immensely when authorities held him for 14 months."I got out to my family because my community helped," said Chowdhury, who is from Bangladesh.Chowdhury now has a permit to work in the U.S. and he hopes to get a green card in the future. His 14-year-old son, Maheen, said he was 11 when immigration authorities showed up to arrest his father at 5 a.m. According to Maheen, the separation put the entire family in a tailspin."Everything was a mess. We had trouble getting food. My mom just cried all the time. We had to sell our car for money," said Maheen Chowdhury, who was born in the U.S.The Chowdhurys said they don't want others to suffer the same pain and that there should be a way for immigrants without criminal records to stay in the country.In Hartford, Conn., dozens of immigrants gathered in front of a federal building after coming from 11 cities across the state. Many say they were angered into action by the refusal of Republicans in Congress to work on immigration reforms. Protesters included Jasmine Mendoza, of Norwalk, Conn., whose husband was deported after a routine traffic stop. Mendoza said she is raising their 8-month-old son alone.Protests were planned in California a day after 23 demonstrators were arrested in San Francisco for blocking traffic in a major intersection.In March, Obama asked Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review enforcement practices to ease his administration's rate of deportations.Under Obama's leadership, almost 2 million people have been removed from the U.S.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Deferred Action Program Offers Lessons For Broader Immigration Reform MIAMI (AP) –  The first year of the Obama administration's temporary reprieve for youth living in the country illegally has shown that any broader immigration reform effort would require the government to better prepare by streamlining application procedures and by providing more information about what documents are needed to apply to stay in America, experts say.Immigrant advocates say the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has worked relatively well. Still, many nonprofits and even some school districts reported serious growing pains as they stretched to accommodate the avalanche of requests related to the application process.The youth program is open to immigrants between the ages of 15 and 32 who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 and live here illegally, haven't left the country since June 2007 and have had no felonies or serious misdemeanors. They must also have a high school diploma or equivalency, or be currently enrolled in school. A total of about 1.7 million people could be eligible for the program.The reprieve affects only a fraction of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally who could be part of larger immigration reform legislation. However, because it's the first major immigration change in many years, experts see it as a template for a more comprehensive, and no doubt more complicated, overhaul."DACA represents an important trial run for a larger legalization process, should one result from comprehensive immigration reform," said Tom Wong, assistant professor of political science at the University California, San Diego, and one of several academics studying the program.Analyzing data from the initial phase of the program, Wong found possible undercounts of the number of eligible applicants in certain states, a trend that could carry over to a more comprehensive reform. Experts have also identified several hiccups that could be obstacles for broader reform: questions about what paperwork can be used to apply, sometimes long processing times and a lack of resources for local organizations, especially those serving Asian and other immigrants who don't speak English or Spanish.The reprieve was up and running 60 days after it was announced in June 2012, and nearly 600,000 people have applied. DHS Spokesman Peter Boogaard cited the program as an example of the administration's ability to quickly and successfully implement effective large-scale immigration programs.About three quarters of applicants have been approved. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency overseeing the program, is mostly self-funded through processing fees, which officials say allows it to keep up with demand.The U.S. Senate passed a major immigration reform bill earlier this year that would include a loan to the immigration agency to help process a larger number of applicants, an acknowledgement that more processing muscle would be needed. Speaker John Boehner recently said the House will not take up a comprehensive bill this year.One of the biggest initial challenges of the reprieve was confusion over what documents were acceptable to show continued residency. USCIS was initially vague on documentation for this requirement, but within a few months of the program launch clarified that school and hospital records and utility bills would be accepted.Because many employers are wary about acknowledging they've hired people in the country illegally, many youths — especially those out of school — sought alternative methods to prove residency, such as doctor visits or social media activity."In California, school systems were overloaded with transcript requests. People wanted copies of their leases from landlords, of their health records. Every part of society was triggered," said Marielena Hincapie, head of the National Immigration Law Center.The Los Angeles Unified School District was so overwhelmed it created a central application form and added two new staffers dedicated to such requests. Advocates say other school districts and local governments have been less proactive.California, Texas, Illinois, New York and Florida had the highest numbers of applicants, and Mexico was the most common country of origin, according to government data through August of this year. Analysis of the data also shows Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina appear to have a higher rate of applicants than states with larger immigrant populations.Wong says several factors may be at play, including potential undercounts of the number of immigrants in states like Georgia, or even over-counts of those eligible in states like California. Should a broader reform pass, regions with newer immigrant communities may need more resources.The Mexican government's cooperation — it quickly provided youth with necessary documents like birth certificates — is also something the U.S. should encourage other countries to emulate should broad reform occur, experts say.Early cases have been resolved in an average of three months, while others have taken half a year or longer. Advocates say the government should plan for bottlenecks from applicants with more complicated situations.Delays can be life altering for applicants, but they can also impact the nation's ability to hold on to talented people in the workforce.Colombian native Juan Gomez was a star student whose parents were deported when he was a teenager. He won a scholarship to Georgetown University and received a temporary work visa to join JP Morgan Chase.Gomez applied for deferment in January, but his case was still undecided when his work visa ran out. Unable to work and tired of living in legal limbo, Gomez left the country in August for a top Brazilian finance firm in Sao Paulo."I immigrated to Brazil with Colombia documents, but I will always feel like an American," he said in a phone interview. "When I close my eyes, I still imagine myself walking the Brooklyn Promenade."Last month, Gomez received notice the government planned to deny his request. The reason: He was no longer in the country.Michael Petrucelli, a former acting director at USCIS, believes the private sector could also play a significant role in the application process. His company, Clearpath, is piloting an online tool he compares to TurboTax, which seeks to help those with simple cases fill out the forms. If and when Congress decides to address the rest of the 11 million people living in the country illegally, Clearpath plans to be ready."Getting a glimpse into the potential future is pretty daunting" he said. "It's a great reason to look at whether you have effective processes in place now."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Democrat Says Immigration Reform Has Stalled Because Of GOP 'Racism' WASHINGTON (AP) –  A lawmaker who heads a House committee to elect Democrats blamed the country’s failure to pass immigration reform on Republican “racism.”Rep. Steve Israel's comments are in line with those from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi earlier this week, in which she blamed racial issues for the GOP's failure to act on comprehensive immigration legislation. Asked about Pelosi's comments, New York's Israel said he agreed with her assessment.- Nacy Pelosi"To a significant extent, the Republican base does have elements that are animated by racism. And that's unfortunate," said Israel, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Frustration is mounting among the House's Democratic minority and immigration activists about Republicans' refusal to act on a far-reaching immigration bill passed by the Senate last year. The Senate bill would provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and tighten border security.Republicans remain wary of a contentious debate on the divisive issue, which could anger their core voters and undercut potential electoral gains in the November elections."I think race has something to do with the fact that they're not bringing up an immigration bill," Pelosi told reporters Thursday.Pelosi was responding to a question about whether race factors into how Republicans deal with members of the Obama administration. She accused Republicans of being generally disrespectful to members of the administration and to women.Oregon's Rep. Greg Walden, who heads Republicans' efforts to elect House members, said blaming racism was "both wrong and unfortunate." He said his Republican colleagues have been critical of President Barack Obama and his party on policy grounds, not racial ones."You know, there have been a lot of executive overreaches by this administration," said Walden who leads the National Republican Congressional Committee. "The American people just want to know the truth. ... They want to know answers. And that's all we're trying to do."Israel and Walden spoke on CNN's "State of the Union." 
Democrats push for new changes to ObamaCare amid midterm fears  Several Democratic senators moved Thursday to "improve" parts of ObamaCare, proposing numerous changes to the law amid concerns that it could cost Democrats House seats and possibly the Senate in November. The proposals came from a half-dozen senators, some of whom are facing reelection in the fall and most of whom represent moderate-to-conservative states. Since Democrats currently control the Senate, the proposals will put Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in an uncomfortable position -- forcing him to decide whether to put the bills to a vote or sideline them, despite the political risks for his party's incumbents. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"There is more to be done," the senators wrote in an op-ed in Politico, outlining the proposed changes. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va.; Mark Begich, D-Alaska; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; and Sen. Angus King, I., Maine, are behind the proposals. Among other ideas, they called for allowing "copper" plans on the government-run health exchanges. The new insurance plans would offer lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs than the "bronze," "silver" and "gold" options currently offered."I've always been a believer that the law was not perfect, but you should continue to work to improve it," Begich told The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the proposals. "People are seeing that as it's implemented, there are tweaks you need to do and there's just nothing wrong with that." The senators, while defending the law itself, proposed numerous other fixes, including restoring startup funds for "consumer-driven health insurance cooperatives" and directing state regulators to look at allowing insurance to be sold across state lines. Plus, they called for sparing employers with fewer than 100 workers from being required to offer health insurance to their staff. Warner, who faces a formidable midterm challenge from former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, said on Fox News earlier this week that he supports allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines.  Earlier this month, Republican David Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a Florida special election largely seen as a referendum on ObamaCare. Democrats, however, downplayed the loss in the Republican-leaning congressional district.Republicans must pick up six seats to win control of the Senate. Conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity are reportedly pouring million into races in which Democratic incumbents have supported ObamaCare.House Democrats must gain 17 seats to win a majority next fall. It looms as a very steep challenge in view of the traditional midterm headwinds facing a party in control of the White House and a generally sour public mood, now compounded by controversy surrounding the health care law.It is unclear if Reid, D., Nev., would bring any of the bills aimed at fixing ObamaCare to the floor. Democratic aides told The Journal that the effort has sparked debate about whether making the changes would return public attention to the health law's flaws.Democratic strategist Steve Murphy said the fixes could help vulnerable lawmakers more than changes from the Obama administration that are immediately criticized by Republicans."Democrats should fight back hard on what eliminating ObamaCare would mean, and they also should demonstrate a willingness to make ObamaCare better," Murphy told The Journal.The Health and Human Services Department announced this week that those who've started an enrollment application, but weren't able to finish before the March 31 open enrollment deadline, would get a limited amount of time to sign up for coverage that would take effect May 1.Additionally, people with 10 general categories of "special" circumstances would also get extra time to apply — up to 60 days. Categories include natural disasters, system errors related to immigration status, computer error messages due to technical difficulties, family situations involving domestic abuse, and other sorts of problems.The latest administrative tweaks to health overhaul rules drew immediate scorn from Republicans committed to repealing the law. "The administration has now handed out so many waivers, special favors and exemptions to help Democrats out politically ... it's basically become the legal equivalent of Swiss cheese," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Some Republicans have expressed reservations about helping Democrats improve a law believed to be central to the GOP's midterm strategy, The Journal reported."These folks have voted for that bad piece of legislation [are] now having remorse," said Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R., Ga., adding that Democrats "want to try to do something political to a very unpopular piece of legislation."The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click here for more from The Wall Street Journal.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Critics warn deportation review could cut ‘what little is left’ of enforcement March 11, 2014: Immigrant rights supporters rally outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Wash.ReutersCritics of the Obama administration's deportation policies are concerned that an internal review could lead to deeper cuts of "what little is left" of immigration enforcement. The White House announced earlier this month that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, at the president's request, would review enforcement policies. The decision came after Johnson, President Obama and White House officials met with immigrant and Latino advocacy groups, many of whom have slammed the administration for being too tough. One has gone so far as to call Obama the "deporter in chief." ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBut a look at the numbers shows deportations under this administration have been limited -- Obama's critics would say, gutted. "The evidence reveals that the administration has carried out a dramatic nullification of federal law," Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said in a statement. The question, then, is how much more the administration is willing to cut deportations under pressure from advocacy groups. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports that it carried out 368,644 removals in fiscal 2013. But the overwhelming majority of those fell into two categories -- illegal immigrants caught crossing the border, and illegal immigrants convicted of a crime in the U.S. Ninety-four percent of all deportations last year fell into one of those two categories. Further, many of those convicted of a crime were found guilty of serious felonies. A report by Sessions' office drilled deeper into the data, finding that just 23,000 people were removed from the country last year who did not fall into those categories. Of them, 13,000 were described as "fugitives or habitual offenders/previous deportees." The Federation for American Immigration Reform warned that the internal DHS review could soon chip away at "what little is left of immigration enforcement." A statement from the group called it "yet another escalation of [Obama's] ongoing defiance of U.S. immigration laws." The statement from the White House earlier this month did not specify what DHS might consider doing to overhaul enforcement. It said only that Johnson was asked to "do an inventory" of current practices "to see how it can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law." Asked about the status of the review, DHS spokesman Peter Boogaard said "any report of specific considerations at this time would be premature." "Since taking office, the Secretary has made clear that he shares the President's commitment of enforcing our immigration laws effectively and sensibly, in line with our values," Boogaard told FoxNews.com in an email. "As part of that effort he has been taking a hard look at these tough issues, meeting with a range of stakeholders and employees and already has been assessing if there are areas where we can further align our enforcement policies with our goal of sound law enforcement practice that prioritizes public safety. "It is fair to say that process is ongoing, and will be conducted expeditiously." Some groups, including the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, have urged the administration to suspend deportations altogether, calling the current policy "unjust." Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, while generally not going that far, have also raised concerns about deportations. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., met Tuesday with Johnson to discuss the issue. "It is clear that the president is serious about addressing the humanitarian crisis that deportations are causing and the Secretary and I had a very productive and positive conversation," he said in a statement after the meeting. Speculating on where the review might go, he said advocacy leaders are discussing with DHS ways to "dial back the deportation of non-criminals and relieve" some of the family separation. But House Speaker John Boehner's office, after the March 14 White House announcement, cautioned the administration against making unilateral changes to enforcement policy. The administration already has made a series of unilateral enforcement changes so far, including guidelines which prioritize deportations of those convicted of crimes, but not others. The report from Sessions' office this week claimed even some illegal immigrants with criminal records are getting a "free pass" from immigration laws and warned that DHS "is planning to widen that amnesty even further." "Under the guise of setting 'priorities', the administration has determined that almost anyone in the world who can enter the United States is free to illegally live, work and claim benefits here as long as they are not caught committing a felony or other serious crime," Sessions said.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Deported Activist Elvira Arellano Released From Custody After Attempt To Enter US Undocumented SAN DIEGO (AP) –  A Mexican woman who received widespread attention for taking refuge in a Chicago church before she was deported in 2007 was released from U.S. custody Thursday, two days after she sought permission to enter the country without legal documents.Elvira Arellano, 38, was paroled by U.S. immigration authorities with her 5-month-old son, Emiliano, who was born in Mexico. They are among about 150 people who have sought to enter the country without legal documents at San Diego's Otay Mesa port of entry since last week in a protest of U.S. immigration policies. Many planned to claim asylum."We are pleased to be here with friends who have helped us," Arellano said. "We are going to continue fighting for other fathers and mothers to also be freed."Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, confirmed Arellano's release and said an immigration judge would determine the outcome of her case.People who claim fear of persecution are often released from custody pending the outcome of their cases before immigration judges. It was unclear how many protesters who crossed in San Diego were in custody and how many were paroled.Unlike similar protests last year in Arizona and Texas, many were not "dreamers" — young adults who came to the U.S. as children. Like Arellano, they were parents of young children.Arellano said she would return to Chicago, where she has an immigration hearing next month. She reunited Thursday with Saul, her 15-year-old son who was born in the U.S. and joined her when crossing the border two days earlier.For years, Arellano has been an outspoken advocate of overhauling U.S. immigration laws and a critic of President Barack Obama for the roughly 2 million deportations that have occurred under his watch. During marches last week in Tijuana, she rallied the crowd with a bullhorn.Arellano hired a smuggler to come to the U.S. illegally in the 1990s and, after three years in Yakima, Wash., moved to Chicago, where she cleaned airplanes for a contractor at O'Hare International Airport. She was arrested in an immigration sting in 2002.Rather than surrender to immigration authorities, she took refuge at the Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago in August 2006. She left after more than a year for a publicity tour that that took her to Los Angeles, where authorities arrested her near a church. She was swiftly deported to Tijuana.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Deported Mexican migrant activist asks for refuge in the US Immigrant rights activist Elvira Arellano waits to enter into the United States where she planned to ask for asylum in Tijuana, Mexico, Tuesday, March 18, 2014. Arellano and another 20 Mexican and Central American migrants crossed into the United States from the border city of Tijuana as part of a protest to demand an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws and an end to deportations. (AP Photo/Alex Cossio)The Associated PressTIJUANA, Mexico –  A Mexican immigrant rights advocate who gained international attention when she took refuge in a Chicago church before being deported asked Tuesday for refuge in the United States on humanitarian grounds.Elvira Arellano crossed into the United States with her U.S.-born teenage and 4-year-old sons along with a group of Mexican and Central American migrants from the border city of Tijuana, many of them deported mothers with U.S.-born children.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"I am asking that they let me in the United States legally on humanitarian grounds, because I am a defender of human rights in Mexico and I've received kidnapping and violence threats," Arellano said before entering the U.S. "But more importantly, because they have separated my son from his chance to have a good upbringing."Arellano, 38, was deported to Mexico in 2007 after seeking sanctuary at a Chicago church for a year. She was deported without her son, who eventually reunited with her in Mexico.Organized by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, this was fourth such group to enter the U.S. at the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego in the last nine days, as part of protests to demand an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws and an end to deportations.The migrants have asked for asylum or visas on humanitarian grounds because they say they have been threatened by criminals or extorted by organized crime."I know I'm risking my freedom and being with my children because I could go to prison," Arellano said before crossing. "But I will fight to be with my children"After Arellano was deported to Tijuana, she founded a home for deported migrants and began speaking publicly about the complex reality of migrant families and how deportations are making their lives more difficult.President Barack "Obama has to stop the deportations and allow us to be with our families," she said.Unlike similar protests last year in Arizona and Texas, many of those crossing into California are not "dreamers" — young adults who came to the U.S. as children. Like Arellano, they are parents who are seeking to return to the U.S. without legal documents, accompanied by their U.S. citizen children.At least two families who have crossed as part of the protests were notified by U.S. authorities that the children would be turned over to a child welfare agency if they were unwilling or unable to immediately designate a responsible adult to take them.Javier Galvan, 38, said he got a call Sunday in Jacksonville, Florida, after his wife and two children crossed into the U.S. that he had 48 hours to pick up his 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son — both U.S. citizens — or they would be placed in child protective services. Their mother, Cecilia Cortes, was held separately in a detention center after claiming asylum. The family returned to Michoacan state in Mexico to visit an ailing relative in 2011."We were really surprised," said Galvan, who claimed asylum last year in the Texas protest and was released pending the outcome of his case. "The children need their mother."The children were picked up Monday at a shelter by a relative who drove from San Francisco.Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately respond to questions about the children with U.S. citizenship.An official at the Mexican consulate in San Diego who spoke on condition of anonymity because the cases are considered private confirmed that U.S. citizen children are being turned over to child welfare authorities. The official didn't know how many.Rocio Hernandez, an organizer for the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, said that 14 U.S. children had been separated from their parents and put in shelters before Sunday.___Associated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this story. 
Deporter-In-Chief? President Obama's Base Turning Against Him Over Inaction On Immigration The criticism of President Obama over the record number of deportations during his tenure has peaked this week on the heels of a speech by a leading Latino civil rights group head that blamed him for separating families.The mounting, years-long frustration among advocates of more lenient immigration policies over the nearly 2 million deportations burst onto the national radar on Tuesday night when Janet Murguia, head of the National Council of La Raza, or NCLR, said in a way more pointed than the group ever has regarding the president that he is responsible for separation of many families and that he has become the “Deporter-in-Chief.”Murguia did not coin the term – it’s been around in reference to Obama and deportation as far back as early 2011. It’s unclear who used it first.And her assertion – that while Congress has failed to act to reform immigration, the President has many tools at his disposal to address certain problems undocumented immigrants face – is one that lenient-immigration-policy advocates have made since at least two years after he moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.But her stature, and the megaphone of the NCRL, gave the old arguments and buzz phrases a high-octane push.Every day since Murguia took Obama to task, immigration advocacy groups and members of Congress who support comprehensive reform that includes giving breaks to undocumented immigrants have picked up the ball and run with it. They’re sending daily emails, holding telephone press conferences, planning a “day of action” – all stressing the failures of the “Deporter-in-Chief,” a term they are using religiously in their message this week.The heat on the president has grown so hot these days that at a town hall meeting with Latinos at the Newseum on Thursday, he said that on immigration, he has been the "Champion-in-Chief.""Since I ran for president, I've pushed for comprehensive immigration reform, and I will continue to push," Obama said, according to published reports. "I am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive immigration reform. But until Congress passes new laws, I am constrained in what I am able to do."Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who is one of the leading voices in Congress pushing for immigration reform, has for years challenged Obama to use his executive powers more to address aspects of the issue.On Friday, Gutierrez and Murguia plan to hold a joint telephonic press briefing on immigration to take Obama to task. A press release about the call noted that both the congressman and Murguia have raised the issue of “the President and his use of prosecutorial discretion to reduce the pain that deportations are causing in immigrant communities.”The pro-reform advocacy community has shifted its focus to the president and stopping the deportations from its focus on comprehensive immigration reform legislation -- at least in the short term."If Republicans don't act in the next two or three months on legislation in the House," said Frank Sharry, head of America's Voice, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., "then most of the immigration reform campaign will focus on President Obama and the demand that he use every ounce of his executive authority to protect undocumented immigrants."On Wednesday, Gutierrez took to the House floor to point a finger of blame on Obama.“Republicans are currently sitting on their hands when it comes to immigration reform because they say they cannot trust the President of the United States to enforce immigration laws,” Gutierrez said to his colleagues in the House, where Republicans have the majority.“Which President deported a population slightly larger than the population of the entire State of Nebraska?” Gutierrez asked rhetorically. “With almost 2 million people deported so far, Barack Obama has deported more people than those that live in the entire State of Nebraska. President Obama gets first place, if you can call it that. So I will put a gold star next to his picture.”Then he asked: “Who spent more on immigration enforcement than all other criminal federal law enforcement combined? Well, if you guessed Barack Obama you’d be right. His almost $18 billion is $3.5 more than we spend on the FBI, ATF, DEA, Secret Service – all of them – combined."And then: “Which of these Presidents put more than 420,000 people in detention in just one single year of his presidency – meaning incarceration in a private or government jail or other facility? President Obama has detained more immigrants in jails, prisons and detention facilities than any other President.”The top ranking for various immigration enforcement records, he said, belonged to Obama, “The Deporter-in-Chief,” Gutierrez said.In November, Obama was heckled by Ju Hong, an activist who yelled at him, “use your executive power to halt deportations,” while they were both standing on a stage at an immigration reform rally in San Francisco.Obama argued at the time that his executive powers on deportations are limited.“If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,” Obama said. “But we’re also a nation of laws. That’s part of our tradition. And so, the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws.”Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said last month that Obama should review his deportation powers.“I would hope that administratively, the president will do what he can to take a look at deportations, but he is being burdened by the law as it exists, and we need to change it,” he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.Reid, however, gave the president political cover on Tuesday, shortly after seven Senate Democrats voted against Debo Adegbile, Obama’s nominee to head the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, an embarrassing setback.“I, of course, believe in family unification, and certainly, I don’t believe in family disunification. One way to put this to bed once and for all is to have the Republicans do what they should do for the American people and move forward on immigration law,” he said.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti jumped into the fray on Wednesday during a visit to Mexico's capital.Garcetti, on his first foreign trip since taking office in July, said he supports Obama on immigration reform but said families and communities have been divided by the president's policy of deportations, which have totaled nearly 2 million since Obama took office.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
DHS Approves Extradition Request For Cuban Fugitive Wanted In $2.8M Heist Raonel Valdez’s time on the lam from U.S. authorities appears to have finally come to an end.   The Cuban fugitive, wanted in the United States for allegedly participating in a $2.8 million gold heist, avoided stiff jail time while carrying out a series of bold crimes in the U.S. before fleeing to the Caribbean on a stolen 30-foot speedboat in December 2012. He was eventually captured in Mexico, but a hold up due to bureaucratic tape meant he could have been set free again.But late Friday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) signed a parole letter allowing Valdez to be brought back to the U.S. to face justice. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations approved the U.S. Marshals Service’s request for the parole of Mr. Raonel Valdez to face criminal charges in the United States,” Barbara Gonzalez, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement to Fox News Latino. The approval by DHS comes after a tense week and much lobbying by the U.S. Marshals Service and the office of U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) to expedite the extradition of Valdez. "We're looking for answers," Debbie Zimmerman, the congresswoman's district chief of staff told FNL on Thursday. "They've got a reason why they're delaying this issue right now, but we're not sure what it is."Valdez came to the U.S. in 2005, quickly obtaining a Social Security card and driver’s license in Florida thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants undocumented immigrants from the island who reach U.S. soil nearly-guaranteed legal status. Soon afterward, Valdez began a career in crime.He earned his first criminal charge in June 2007 when he was busted for possession of marijuana.He was soon paroled and, the next year, cops found 85 grams of methamphetamine under the hood of his car. In July 2008, Valdez was arrested again. This time for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for attacking security guards while trying to steal an $18 pair of garden shears Home Depot.Valdez then jumped his bail and fled to Mexico, where he soon ran afoul of authorities and was arrested on charges of human smuggling for taking people from Cuba to Mexico.After he was recruited by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to help kidnap a high-ranking Zetas drug cartel member – an attempt that failed because they wound up netting the wrong guy. Valdez wound up back in Miami where U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested him at Miami International Airport for missing a 2008 court date.While Florida Judge Victoria Brennan let him walk free for time served, Valdez soon racked a string of offenses in the next year, including another drug possession charge for operating a Miami marijuana growing operation, abusing the mother of his 2-year-old daughter and getting slapped with a felony armed robbery charge that earned him a GPS tracker.Then came the armed gold heist that netted 110 pounds of gold flakes – valued at nearly $3 million – from an unsuspecting, sickly courier, George Villegas, who was on his way to deliver the precious metals to a refinery.A GPS tracker on his ankle showed Valdez casing an apartment complex where he allegedly swiped the gold off of Villegas. It showed when he entered the building and followed him for five days afterward as he peddled the gold to various pawn shops in Miami-Dade County and bought a girlfriend a 2008 Toyota Yaris, before the signal from the ankle monitor went dead, and Valdez disappeared from the map.Valdez was picked up by local authorities at Belize’s border with Guatemala earlier this year. Since then, he has been held at Hattieville Prison in Belize City while awaiting extradition to the U.S.Follow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino     
Divided GOP only thing Obama, Democrats have going for them before 2014 midterms April 29, 2014: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, joined by Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., talks to reporters following a Republican strategy meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington.APTuesday’s Washington Post/ABC News poll will not be welcome news to a suffering Democrat party.Figures show that by 53 to 39 percent margin, Americans want Republicans to control Congress.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe electorate thinks it’s more important to have the Republicans in charge, to serve as a check on the president’s policies, as opposed to have Democrats in charge to help support the president’s policies. This is a clear knock on President Obama, the Democrats’ agenda and their execution of the agenda.This result is almost identical to the results of the same question when it was asked in September 2010, two months before the GOP landslide.This is a bad omen, to say the least.President Obama’s approval rating took a dive. It’s now at 41 percent down from 46 percent through the first three months of 2014. And Wednesday’s WSJ/NBC News poll doesn’t offer much better news: the president’s approval rating there is at 44 percent.Fifty-two percent disapprove of the job Obama is doing. And only 42 percent approve of his handling of the economy, 37 percent approve of how he is handling the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and 34 percent approve of his handling of the situation involving Ukraine and Russia. In the WSJ/NBC News poll, the president’s handling of the situation Russia’s intervention in Ukraine slipped to 37 percent from 43 percent in March.If these numbers hold up – and there’s no reason to think that they won’t as Obama’s approval rating is also going down in both recent Gallup and Economist/YouGov polls – the Democrats are facing an even greater challenge than they thought. We are now looking at an increased likelihood of the Democrats losing the Senate in November.According to the New York Times/Kaiser Foundation, close races in four southern states could very well tip the Senate to the Republicans. The poll highlights the races in Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky and Louisiana – all states that President Obama lost in 2012 and where his disapproval ratings run as high as 60 percent.At the outset, we must be realistic about West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota, which are most likely losses for the Democrats.North Carolina is very much in play. Kay Hagan has the support of 42 percent of voters while the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Thom Tillis, is at 40 percent. Hagan’s approval rating is at 44 percent – the same as her disapproval number.Mark Pryor currently holds a 10-point lead in Arkansas and has a 47-38 approval rating, but tanking Democrat numbers are bound to tighten up his race. The same is true of Mary Landrieu’s race in Louisiana where she has an early lead, but has faced tremendous criticism over ObamaCare and has already been hard at work distancing herself from the president’s agenda.Despite this bleak picture, there are still two things that work to the Democrats’ advantage. The first is that McConnell is effectively tied with his Democratic challenger and has a 52 percent disapproval rating. That said, the Republican nature of the state still makes him a favorite especially considering how unpopular Obama is in the state (32 percent approval for the president).And in Georgia, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn and Democrat candidate Michelle Nunn is currently in a dead heat or ahead of every potential Republican opponent. A win for the former nonprofit CEO would be a real surprise in the conservative state, which hasn’t seen a Democratic senator in nearly 10 years, but it’s not impossible.It follows that the depth of Obama’s problems are so substantial that we now must view the Republicans themselves, their infighting and partisan attitude as one of, if not the only, asset the president still has. Close to 70 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Republicans are doing in Congress according to the latest McClatchy-Marist poll.The Republicans have no message and no strategy. And they’re running out of time to develop one that goes beyond just running against Obama.Indeed, Republicans are turning on each other. Just a few days ago at the Middletown Rotary Club, House Speaker John Boehner mocked his own party for their intransigence when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform.“Here’s the attitude: ‘Ohhhh, don’t make me do this. Ohhh, this is too hard’…We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and it’s remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just don’t want to,” Boehner said. He continued, “They’ll take the path of least resistance…I’ve had every brick and bat and arrow shot at me over this issue just because I wanted to deal with it. I didn’t say it was going to be easy.”Speaker Boehner’s comments portray a deeply divided Republican party. And this is where the Democrats have the chance to eek it out in November.There is an opportunity for the Democrats to run effectively on attacking the Republicans and not just on their message of fairness and redistribution. They can paint the Republicans as hyper-partisan, divided and, thereby, bad for the country.It isn’t exciting – or good politics for that matters – but it may just do the trick.Douglas E.

Dominican immigration says woman fighting for citizenship rights can't fly to US meeting SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic –  Dominican immigration officers have barred a woman of Haitian descent who's fighting for Dominican citizenship from flying to the U.S. to meet with a human rights body.A legal challenge by Juliana Deguis Pierre resulted in a Dominican constitutional court ruling last year that could let the government retroactively strip citizenship mostly from people of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTPierre went to Santo Domingo's airport Sunday with lawyers headed for a U.S. meeting of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which will discuss the citizenship issue at a Monday meeting in Washington.Pierre showed immigration officers a special document provided to her by the U.S. State Department. But the Dominican officers decided it was not sufficient to allow her to travel on an international flight and said she needs a passport. 
Dos condados de Colorado dejan de responder a pedidos de inmigraciÃ³n Denver (CO), 29 abr (EFEUSA).- Los alguaciles de dos condados de Colorado, uno cerca de Denver y otro en el oeste del estado, anunciaron hoy que, debido a recientes decisiones de la justicia federal, ya no responderÃ¡n a los pedidos del Servicio de InmigraciÃ³n y Aduanas (ICE) para mantener detenidos a inmigrantes indocumentados."Es una muy buena noticia. Pero la noticia serÃ­a aÃºn mejor si los otros 62 condados tambiÃ©n hiciesen lo mismo", opinÃ³ VÃ­ctor Cabrera, originario de Guatemala y director de la FundaciÃ³n Una Vida Mejor en Commerce City, un suburbio de Denver.Cabrera considerÃ³ que los cambios recientemente anunciados por el Gobierno federal en cuando a las deportaciones podrÃ­an haber influido en las decisiones de los alguaciles de los Condados Boulder, a unos 50 km al noroeste de Denver y San Miguel, situado en el lÃ­mite con Utah."Sea como fuere, el presidente Obama estÃ¡ implementando cambios en cuanto a inmigraciÃ³n. QuizÃ¡ todo esto se terminarÃ­a con una buena reforma inmigratoria", aseverÃ³.Esta maÃ±ana, el alguacil Joe Pelle, de Boulder, y el alguacil Bill Masters, de San Miguel, comunicaron a distintos medios que ya no honrarÃ¡n las llamadas "Ã³rdenes de detenciÃ³n de inmigrantes" (immigration detainers, en inglÃ©s).Pero esa decisiÃ³n se basa no en los cambios implementados por el poder ejecutivo federal sino en dos recientes decisiones judiciales, una en OregÃ³n y la otra en Pennsylvania, en las que las cortes dictaminaron que esas "Ã³rdenes" son "pedidos" por parte de ICE, pero no realmente Ã³rdenes que las jurisdicciones locales deban obligatoriamente cumplir.Como resultado de la decisiÃ³n, los presos indocumentados en las cÃ¡rceles de los condados Boulder y San Miguel podrÃ¡n quedar en libertad una vez que se resuelvan sus casos o cumplan sus sentencias a nivel local o estatal y sin necesidad de permanecer demorados hasta que agentes de ICE lleguen a buscarlos.Cabe destacar que en enero de 2011, cuando se implementÃ³ en Colorado el programa federal "Comunidades Seguras" de colaboraciÃ³n entre ICE y la policÃ­a local, el alguacil Pelle fue uno de los primeros en manifestarse a favor del programa, indicando en aquel momento que era una herramienta adecuada para determinar la situaciÃ³n legal y los antecedentes penales de los extranjeros arrestados en el Condado Boulder.Pero Pelle eventualmente modificÃ³ su postura y en abril de 2013 respaldÃ³ una propuesta (eventualmente aprobada) para otorgarles licencias de conducir a ciertas personas indocumentadas en Colorado.Por su parte, en declaraciones preparadas, el alguacil Masters (en el cargo desde 1980), dijo que "esta parece ser la acciÃ³n correcta bajo las circunstancias de la decisiÃ³n federal".SegÃºn Masters, de 30 a 40 indocumentados se alojan cada aÃ±o en la cÃ¡rcel del Condado San Miguel, principalmente por ilÃ­citos relacionados con sustancias controladas.

DREAMER Bill Giving Undocumented Immigrants In-State Tuition Rates Passes Through Florida House TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) –  Amid sharp criticism over the nation's immigration policies, the Florida House on Thursday passed a bill that would let qualified Florida students pay in-state college tuition rates even if they are in the country illegally.But the legislation only cleared by an 81-33 margin as a sizable number of Republicans voted against the bill even though it is a top priority of House Speaker Will Weatherford.Backers of the measure, however, argued that it was wrong for the state to deny help to those who had been brought to Florida when they were children."Don't hold these children responsible for something they had no control over," said Rep. Jeanette Nunez, R-Miami.The bill would grant a tuition waiver to high school graduates who attended a Florida school for four consecutive years regardless of their immigration status. The in-state rate is roughly one quarter of the rate paid by out-of-state students.The debate over in-state tuition for certain students who entered the country illegally has been a perennial one in Tallahassee. Similar bills passed the House and Senate but never in the same year.At least 15 other states have passed such laws, with other states considering them this year. The trend reflects immigrant advocates' increasing focus on state legislatures as Congress fails to make any headway on national immigration reform. It also highlights lawmakers' growing recognition of the influence of Latino voters.Several GOP legislators sharply criticized the federal government over immigration as a reason to back the bill."We must recognize the fact the federal government has refused to do what is right about our immigration problem," said Rep. Charlie Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights. "They do not have the courage to deal with it."But the Thursday vote showed the sharp divide among Republicans. Senate President Don Gaetz remains opposed to granting the tuition break and other top Republicans in the Senate have also come out against it.House Republicans opposed to the bill did not debate against it, but several have argued previously it was wrong to give a benefit to someone whose family broke the law.Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, said legislators don't really know how much the change in policy will cost."Until we know that, to put that burden on Florida taxpayers is probably unwise," Gaetz said.Gov. Rick Scott backs a Senate bill that includes the tuition break because it would place limits on how much universities could raise tuition rates.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Drug smugglers hitting high seas as Coast Guard faces budget cuts  Budget cuts at the Coast Guard are coming at an unfortunate time. As the service, like other branches of the military, makes do with less, drug smugglers are increasingly turning to the high seas -- and challenging the Coast Guard's already strained resources. Officials tell Fox News that drug smugglers are moving some of their operations away from the U.S.-Mexico land border and out into the ocean where it's easier to avoid law enforcement. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAnd for U.S. patrollers, that theater is becoming harder and harder to defend. "As the Department of Homeland Security became more effective at stopping smuggling across the land borders, the cartels shifted some of the traffic to the maritime, so that is why we saw an increase in smuggling by boats," said Capt. Jim Jenkins, Coast Guard commander for Los Angeles and Long Beach. Casey Hehr, chief of law enforcement for the same sector, told Fox News that tracking the traffickers is like "finding a needle in the haystack." The Coast Guard patrols 95,000 miles of coastline, covering 4.5 million square miles of maritime area. "There's thousands of ... square miles of water that we are actually responsible for securing," Hehr said. Overall, federal spending cuts have forced the Coast Guard to reduce its operating costs by 25 percent. While helping the government reach deficit reduction targets, this is also threatening efforts to reach President Obama's goal of intercepting 40 percent of illicit drug shipments by 2015. "We deal with the assets and the hours that we have, and we try to use them as best we can to stop the smuggling," Hehr said. Over the last several years, the cartels have moved further offshore as their boats have gotten more sophisticated. The area they operate in has tripled in size in just the last year -- and is now roughly the size of Montana. Some of the modern smuggling boats have three engines and can hold up to 20 tons of drugs. Plus, they can travel hundreds of miles north of the border. "A huge part to the puzzle is the interdiction of these vessels before they reach shore," said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Claude Arnold. "So if resources are cut, that's going to have an effect, and our investigations are largely based upon those interdictions."Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Dutch ruling coalition slammed in local elections; Labor loses Amsterdam after 65 years on top AMSTERDAM –  Parties in the Netherlands' centrist ruling coalition have suffered major losses in local elections.Perhaps most dramatically, junior member Labor lost its grip on power in Amsterdam for the first time in 65 years.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAlthough Wednesday's municipal elections focused on local issues, the results released Thursday reflect dissatisfaction with the austerity policies of conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his Labor Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem.Major winners included the centrist D-66 party, which took Amsterdam, and the far right Freedom Party of populist Geert Wilders, which is anti-European and anti-immigration.Rutte said he had a "dirty taste" in his mouth after Wilders led his supporters Wednesday in chanting they want "fewer" Moroccans in the Netherlands. 
Economy concerns may doom Democrats Oct. 23, 2013: College students wait in line at a job fair held by the Miami Marlins, at Marlins Park in Miami.APWant FOX News First in your inbox every day?

How good or how bad the controversial law is will take years to reveal. A new poll out from National Journal, however, reminds us what the problem for Democrats this year is. It’s not the policy per se, but the belief among voters that President Obama’s policies are hurting their chances for prosperity. The poll, which doesn’t even limit itself to registered voters, still finds the president stuck with low job approval (41 percent). There’s also the intensity question: “The share of adults who strongly disapprove of his performance (39 percent) is nearly double that of those who strongly approve (21 percent)…”Demographic disaster - White voters will be the key in the states crucial to Democrats’ remaining hopes to hold on to the Senate – particularly in states with substantially whiter populations than the nation as a whole, like Iowa (92 percent white), Colorado (88 percent white) and Minnesota (87 percent white) “Among whites overall, just 35 percent said they approve of his performance, while 59 percent disapprove,” wrote Ron Brownstein.Why so low? - “Just 25 percent of all respondents said they believed his agenda would increase opportunities for people like them. That's the smallest positive response the poll has recorded except for the two surveys last fall. In the new poll, a full 46 percent said they believed his actions would diminish their opportunities-essentially tying the 47 percent in each of last fall’s polls as his worst showing on that measure. The remaining 23 percent said they did not think his actions would affect their opportunities.”The fast food recovery - NYT: “The deep recession wiped out primarily high-wage and middle-wage jobs. Yet the strongest employment growth during the sluggish recovery has been in low-wage work, at places like strip malls and fast-food restaurants. In essence, the poor economy has replaced good jobs with bad ones. That is the conclusion of a new report from the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group, analyzing employment trends four years into the recovery.  ‘Fast food is driving the bulk of the job growth at the low end — the job gains there are absolutely phenomenal,’ said Michael Evangelist, the report’s author… But job losses and gains have been skewed. Higher-wage industries — like accounting and legal work — shed 3.6 million positions during the recession and have added only 2.6 million positions during the recovery. But lower-wage industries lost two million jobs, then added 3.8 million.”Something to talk about - WSJ: “The Senate is expected this week to take up a long-stalled push to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a measure that is likely to be defeated but one that Democrats see as a winner on the campaign trail.”[The American Enterprise Institute’s James Glassman says the GOP must become the party of “grow” not “no”- “…even if a policy of ‘no’ – to fixing Obamacare, opening up trade, and reforming the tax code and immigration – may appear to work in 2014, it will certainly fail in 2016. Republicans need to convince voters that they, and not the Democrats, are the party of ‘grow.’”]HOW DO YOU SAY ‘STRAW MAN’ IN TAGALOG?What is the Obama Doctrine on foreign policy? That was Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry’s question to President Obama at a press conference in the Philippines today. The president didn’t say what it was, but did expound on what it wasn’t. “Typically, criticism of our foreign policy has been directed at the failure to use military force. And the question I think I would have is, why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we’ve just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget?  And what is it exactly that these critics think would have been accomplished?”[Gee, look at the time - “Well Ed, I would – I doubt that I will have time to lay out my entire foreign policy doctrine…” – President Obama in the preface to his 949-word response to Henry’s question.]Obama says he “avoids errors” on foreign policy - “And that may not always be sexy.  That may not always attract a lot of attention, and it doesn’t make for good argument on Sunday morning shows.  But it avoids errors.  You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run.  But we steadily advance the interests of the American people and our partnership with folks around the world.”Bows to Europe on sanctions - NYT: “During internal deliberations, Jacob J. Lew, the secretary of the Treasury, and other officials have argued for caution, maintaining that, while action is needed, more expansive measures without European support might hurt American business interests without having the desired impact on Russia, according to people informed about the discussion. Mr. Obama has been particularly intent on not getting too far in front of Europe to avoid giving Mr. Putin a chance to drive a wedge in the international coalition that has condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea and destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine…”KERRY: ISRAEL RISKS BECOMING ‘AN APARTHEID STATE’Daily Beast: “If there’s no two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict soon, Israel risks becoming ‘an apartheid state,’ Secretary of State John Kerry told a room of influential world leaders in a closed-door meeting Friday…Kerry's use of the loaded term is already rankling Jewish leaders in America—and it could attract unwanted attention in Israel, as well.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., declined to offer a direct endorsement of 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. When asked if Clinton was her candidate in 2016 Warren stated, “You know, all of the women – Democratic women, I should say, of the Senate – urged Hillary Clinton to run, and I hope she does.” When pressed further, the favorite among populist Democrats only offered, “Hillary is terrific.”[Back in Washington after a weekend campaign swing that took her to Kentucky and Arizona, Hillary Clinton will speak to early childhood education advocates.]Shhh, nobody tell Liz - Politico: “The darkest secret in the big money world of the Republican coastal elite is that the most palatable alternative to a nominee such as Sen.

Osborn directly attacks chief rival Ben Sasse for prior statements on ObamaCare edited to sound as if Sasse, a former health-insurance policy wonk in the Bush administration, favored the law. Osborn says Sasse was “bragging on” ObamaCare, the kind of thinly-sliced swipe usually farmed out to sinister-voiced narrators in order to protect the positive image of the candidate. Why take the risk in making his attacks personal with only 15 days to go until the primary? Osborn’s second round of negative ads comes on the heels of a rally Friday featuring conservative icons Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and former Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, campaigning for Sasse. The event drew an estimated 1,000 attendees, a suggestion that Osborn’s grasp on the lead may be slipping in the closing days. It was Osborn’s prior stint as state treasurer, not his claim to conservative purity, that won him the backing today of the Lincoln Journal-Star. The paper said there “is not much difference between the GOP candidates on the issues,” but gave the nod to Osborn as the “only one with experience as an elected official.”[FreedomWorks CEO Matt Kibbe sheds some light on why the conservative group withdrew its support for Osborn to back Sasse, particularly citing the fact that “a lot of the establishment Republicans were gathering behind” Osborn.]BRANNON BLASTS TILLIS ‘CULTURE OF CORRUPTION’ In his latest ad, North Carolina Republican Senate hopeful Greg Brannon blasts State House Speaker Thom Tillis for “bringing a culture of corruption to Raleigh.”  From the ad: “While Thom Tillis collects checks from lobbyists and D.C. fat cats, the Brannon campaign was filled with contributions form 13,000 folks just like you.”PICK SIX: LANDRIEU’S PROTECTIVE BACON WRAPPER?Republicans are hoping to pick up an additional six seats to gain control of the Senate this November.

Scott Peters, a Democrat. But because he is who he is, and because his opponents are making an issue about his sexual orientation and lying about his record, he’s willing to talk about it. And he’s disrupting all of the stereotypes. For instance, DeMaio has been the target of homophobic attacks. But where are those attacks coming from? It’s not always from the far right social conservatives you’d expect; rather, it’s been from DeMaio’s left – the liberal and Democrat-affiliated groups that you’d think would be proud that an openly gay successful businessman has decided to run for office.”NYC’S $185 MILLION TUNNEL TO NOWHEREAssociated Press: “There’s a federally funded, $185 million tunnel being built on Manhattan’s West Side…and it leads nowhere. ‘The 800-foot-long, 35-foot-deep concrete trench could someday lead to two new commuter rail tunnels under the Hudson River to New Jersey, if the billions needed to build them ever materialize.’ The flood-resistant tunnel was approved as part of a Hurricane Sandy relief effort, but while building has begun, and is expected to be completed in fall 2015, prospects for where the tunnel will lead remain dim at best.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Ecuadorian Immigrant Facing Deportation Hopes To Stay After Judge Drops Felony Conviction HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) –  An Ecuadorian immigrant facing possible deportation said Wednesday he hopes to be allowed to stay in the United States after a court removed a felony conviction stemming from a clash with a now-disgraced Connecticut police officer.Edgar Marin, 32, was allowed to plead guilty on Monday to reduced charges related to his encounter with Officer Dennis Spaulding, who was among four East Haven officers arrested in a scandal over police abuse of Latinos.Marin, a legal U.S. resident, struck a plea agreement in 2011 that led to his conviction on a charge of assaulting an officer. He was sentenced to two years' probation and then, in January, U.S. immigration agents detained him and moved to return him to Ecuador on grounds that he was a convicted felon."They never told me this was going to be a consequence," said Marin, who was released on bond from detention last week.In an effort to prevent deportation, Marin's lawyers said the charges should be reduced, arguing that Spaulding has been discredited by his criminal conviction. Defense lawyer David Forsythe said prosecutors cooperated with the request. On Monday, Marin was allowed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge of interference with an officer.Prosecutors did not respond to requests for comment.Marin was arrested in June 2011 as police tried to tow his car following an accident. Marin said Spaulding used racially charged language as he blocked Marin from getting tools out of the car. Marin said he tried to stop the car from being towed, Spaulding pushed him and broke his wrist, and it was then that Marin pushed Spaulding. But an attorney for Spaulding said witnesses backed up his account that Marin was the aggressor.Spaulding, who was arrested by the FBI in January 2012, was sentenced in January to five years in prison for conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of Hispanics, making false arrests and using unreasonable force. Marin was not among those to testify against him at trial.Frank Riccio, an attorney for Spaulding, said the episode reflected a history of bad blood between his client and the Marin family, including a cousin who testified against Spaulding. Riccio said he understands that a case is weakened when a key witness is convicted of a crime but he said Spaulding would not agree that he was discredited.Marin, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador 14 years ago, said that during his six-week detention his 6-year-old son was told that he was away working because he did not want him to know he was behind bars.His immigration lawyer, Yale Law School student Elliot Friedman, said he hopes deportation proceedings will be stopped at his next hearing on May 6."It is morally and legally incorrect for Edgar to be in this position and threatened with deportation," Friedman said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Spike In Stolen Artifacts In Latin America Spurs Concerns Over Rising Black Market Trade Ecuadorean authorities have reported a recent uptick in thefts of historical artifacts from museums, churches and private collection, causing worry in the Andean nation and abroad about a possible surge in the lucrative antiquities trafficking market in Latin America.In the first four months of 2014 there have been 17 reports of stolen artifacts in Ecuador â compared with just two thefts in 2012 and none in 2013 â with the stolen good garnering anywhere between $4,000 and $8,000 a piece on the black market, Ecuadorâs National Institute of Cultural Patrimony (INPC) reported.Ecuadorâs rise comes as Mexico, Peru, Guatemala and Colombia are also seeing an increase in the number of archeological relics being pilfered.While the theft and trafficking of cultural artifacts has been happening for centuries â from Egyptian grave robbers to raids of Syrian museums during its ongoing civil war - the current rise in Ecuador and other countries worries authorities as Latin America has been a region that many watchdog groups have made concerted efforts to guard.âLatin America, along with the Middle East, is a major region for archaeological digs and also for this type of trafficking,â Roni Amelan, a spokesperson for the UNESCO, told Fox News Latino.The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property in 1970 as a measure to get nations to crackdown on the illegal trade in artifacts. While this measure has been in place for over 40 years, much like U.N. conventions on drugs and sex trafficking, it is much easier for a nation to say it will combat the trade than actually successfully carry it out.From single person treasure hunters to large-scale operations, archaeological digs around the globe have been ransacked in scenes out of Indian Jones and everyone from auction houses, to buyers to local governments have been duped into purchasing the stolen goods.âA lot of these real artifacts have ended up in museums and auction houses in Europe and the U.S.,â said Adam Isacson, a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. âThere is a real black market out there for these items.âThe illegal trade of historic objects is almost as profitable as arms trafficking and drugs, according to the report âCulture and Development: No To Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Propertyâ released last year by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Today the figure hauled in by traffickers is around $ 6 billion annually, with the U.S. , Switzerland , Italy, France, Germany, Spain, England, Japan and Saudi Arabia being the major markets for South American antiquities.Along with UNESCO and the international police organization Interpol, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also joined in the fight as many of the stolen artifacts from South America end up in U.S. auction houses and private collections.âThe networks are very organized,â Thomas Mulhall, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security said at a press conference last year. âThere is an understanding that the item is relatively easily obtained. Itâs difficult to excavate and to uncover, but youâll see networks that will piggyback or follow an academic excavation thatâs going onâ¦.And theyâll trade them through a network, knowing that the United States is the strongest market, one of the strongest markets.âEcuador has had some success in recovering some of the stolen artifacts â since 2008 the INPC has repatriated 681 stolen historical artifacts such as the painting titled "Los negros de Esmeraldas" and a sculpture titled "Apostolâ taken from Quito's Hispanic Cultural Institute. But UNESCO said that given the relative poverty in the country and the ease in which people can enter some archaeological sites, the trade looks likely to continue."They are poor people with a great knowledge of the geography where the deposits are located,â UNESCO said, âand for a little money will deliver the extracted objects.âFollow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino     
The Elizabeth Warren fantasy: Why the press insists she might run  When it comes to Elizabeth Warren, the press won’t take no for an answer.She says she’s not jumping into the 2016 fray, and my colleagues don’t care. It doesn’t matter what she says. They’re going to push the idea anyway. A Hillary runaway is just too boring to contemplate.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe woman who’s been a senator for a little over a year is having a moment because she’s out peddling a book. And that has given TV types a chance to pepper her with questions about the White House.The turning point for me came a couple of days ago when ABC’s David Muir whether she was going to run.“I’m not running for president,” Warren said.“There’s nothing that could change your mind?”“David, like I said, I’m not running for president.”“And do you think Hillary Clinton would make a good president?”“I think Hillary Clinton is terrific.”The next day, I saw all kinds of cable news segments on whether Warren really meant it. The pundits parsed her words: Aha! She used present tense but didn’t rule out running in the future! She ducked the question on Hillary as president!This is just sad.It’s not that politicians never break their words during this kabuki dance. Barack Obama told Tim Russert he wouldn’t run for president either.And Elizabeth Warren is an interesting character. I’ve seen her talk about how her mother went to work at Sears to feed four kids after her dad had a heart attack, how they had to give up the family station wagon, and how her bumpy childhood convinced her to fight for the middle class against the big banks. That’s a message with resonance on the Democratic left.But why the media have to frame every single debate around is-she-running—the same goes for Jeb Bush and his comments on immigration—is hard to fathom. Except that yakking about the handicapping for 2016 is easier than analyzing the issues of 2014.Matt Bai, the former New York Timesman who decamped to Yahoo, says he doesn’t believe Hillary can clear the Democratic field and that someone will run against her:“Should Clinton ultimately decide to run, someone will emerge to channel the energy of the antiestablishment opposition, to portray her as too compromising and too corporate. And she could do a lot, lot worse than to have that someone be Elizabeth Warren.“Warren's backers are probably right that there's a wide lane in Democratic politics for running against corporate excess, and if Clinton doesn't run, an incursion like that might really take off. But as John Edwards found out in 2008, it's not an easy thing to portray Hillary as a stooge for Wall Street, no matter how much of its cash she vacuums up. For most Democrats, her last name is still synonymous with the prosperity of the '90s, which is one reason why – even after she publicly rushed to the defense of Washington lobbyists – working-class white voters overwhelmingly supported her over Obama.”Still, Bai concludes that “Warren's got to be too smart to swallow the hype about taking on Hillary.”Many still invoke a “Hillary’s Nightmare” story in the New Republic last fall:“As in 2008, Greater Hillaryland, if not the Clinton campaign itself, would quietly work to disqualify Warren as a crazed, countercultural liberal …“A Clinton-Warren matchup would have all sorts of consequences, none of them especially heartwarming. The most immediate is that Warren would probably lose. Though Warren has been boning up on a variety of policy areas in periodic dinners with experts—she told me there are several issues beyond Wall Street ‘we need to have frank conversations’ about without naming specifics — she remains a work in progress as a politician. She is still pedestrian in front of a crowd despite her strengths as a questioner and debater, and her Senate campaign last year was bumpier than it should have been. At this stage in their careers, Clinton is simply easier to visualize as president.”Joe Trippi, Howard Dean’s 2004 campaign chief and a Fox News contributor, is quoted as saying Warren doesn’t pass the experience threshold. But, he added, “Neither did Obama till the campaign.”Of course, when the Elizabeth Warren speculation machine slows down, we can always kickstart it with this question: What if Hillary doesn’t run? Click for more from Media Buzz. Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Enforcement ‘Crisis’? Documents show 68,000 ‘criminal aliens’ released last year  Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 68,000 foreign nationals who had criminal convictions and charges last year instead of pursuing deportation, according to newly uncovered documents -- a statistic one senator said represents an enforcement "crisis." The internal documents were obtained and published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based group that advocates stricter immigration enforcement. According to the documents and the group's analysis, ICE agents reported encountering 193,000 "criminal aliens" in 2013, but only targeted 125,000 for deportation. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTA total of 67,879 were released. CIS called it a "large-scale abuse of authority." "The Obama administration's deliberate obstruction of immigration enforcement, in which tens of thousands of criminal aliens are released instead of removed, is threatening the well-being of American communities," study author Jessica Vaughan said in a statement. "It's not a matter of if, but how many families will suffer harm as a result." The "criminal aliens" category includes both those charged with and convicted of crimes in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement accused CIS of distorting the numbers, and claimed that some of them could represent minor offenses. Further, the agency said a total of 216,000 "convicted criminals" were removed in 2013. "ICE is focused on the removal of criminal aliens," a spokeswoman said in a statement. "The percentage of criminals removed continues to rise. Nearly 60 percent of ICE's total removals had been previously convicted of a criminal offense, and that number rises to 82 percent for individuals removed from the interior of the U.S. The removal of criminal individuals is and will remain ICE's highest priority." The ICE documents did not break down the types of criminal activity that those allowed to stay in the country had been convicted of. But a 2012 report by House Republicans tracked 26,000 illegal and criminal immigrants who were re-arrested, and found they were tied to 58,000 crimes and violations -- much of them drunken-driving arrests, but also major criminal offenses like murder and rape. The latest statistics challenge repeated claims by the administration that, when weighing whether to pursue deportation, they are prioritizing cases where the illegal immigrant in question has been convicted of a crime. Indeed, the documents show that those with a criminal record are far more likely to be targeted for deportation than those without one. But they also show the agency is letting thousands who have a criminal record off the hook. The CIS report said factors such as "family relationships, political considerations, or attention from advocacy groups" are likely helping to "trump criminal convictions as a factor leading to deportation." The report further deepens concerns about the course of an ongoing internal review of the administration's enforcement and deportation policies. Groups like CIS have warned that this could chip away at an enforcement structure that already has been weakened. "The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed," Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said. "Even those with criminal convictions are being released. [The Department of Homeland Security] is a department in crisis." Earlier this month, a DHS spokesman said the internal review of immigration enforcement is a process that is "ongoing" and will be done "expeditiously." "Since taking office, the secretary has made clear that he shares the president's commitment of enforcing our immigration laws effectively and sensibly, in line with our values," the spokesman said. "As part of that effort he has been taking a hard look at these tough issues, meeting with a range of stakeholders and employees and already has been assessing if there are areas where we can further align our enforcement policies with our goal of sound law enforcement practice that prioritizes public safety." CIS also reported that in 2013, ICE charged just 195,000 of the 722,000 "potentially deportable aliens" they encountered. Further, the agency reported more than 870,000 illegal immigrants have been ordered removed but have remained in the country anyway.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Estudiantes a punto de lograr que Florida apruebe matrÃ­culas a indocumentados Emilio J. LÃ³pezMiami, 30 abr (EFEUSA).- La tenaz lucha de los estudiantes indocumentados de Florida por una matrÃ­cula universitaria asequible ha dado su fruto: el Senado estatal debatiÃ³ hoy el proyecto de ley y tiene previsto votarlo y aprobarlo este jueves.Se trata de una "victoria fruto del esfuerzo, el sacrificio, la entrega y la perseverancia de las organizaciones y los jÃ³venes estudiantes", dijo a Efe Francisco Portillo, presidente de la organizaciÃ³n hondureÃ±a Francisco MorazÃ¡n.Portillo forma parte del cerca de un centenar de estudiantes, familiares y grupos a favor de los inmigrantes que llevan varios dÃ­as concentrados ante el Capitolio de Tallahasse, la capital de Florida, para reclamar una votaciÃ³n y aprobaciÃ³n del proyecto de ley que otorgarÃ­a matrÃ­culas universitarias como residentes a los indocumentados en este estado.Portillo no dudÃ³ en mostrarse optimista respecto de la votaciÃ³n del jueves, porque "los votos ya los hemos logrado y lo Ãºnico que hacÃ­a falta es que llegara al pleno del Senado". "MaÃ±ana aprueban el proyecto", seÃ±alÃ³ el confiado activista.Como medida de presiÃ³n entregaron este martes al vicegobernador de Florida, Carlos LÃ³pez-Cantera, una peticiÃ³n con 16.000 firmas para que el gobernador del estado, Rick Scott, presione para que se someta a votaciÃ³n el proyecto de ley antes del prÃ³ximo 2 de mayo, Ãºltimo dÃ­a de sesiones.Frank Collins, portavoz de Scott, asegurÃ³ a Efe que el gobernador "continÃºa luchando por reducir el costo de las matrÃ­culas para todos los estudiantes de Florida"."El gobernador, junto con los exgobernadores Jeb Bush y Bob MartÃ­nez, exigiÃ³ una acciÃ³n inmediata para permitir a los estudiantes que han vivido su infancia aquÃ­ en la Florida, que califiquen para la misma tarifa de matrÃ­culas universitarias que pagan sus compaÃ±eros de clase", dijo Collins.Scott, que ha dejado bien claro que firmarÃ¡ el proyecto de ley en cuanto llegue a sus manos, asegurÃ³ que las matrÃ­culas universitarias deben hacerse mÃ¡s asequibles para todos los estudiantes que "llaman a la Florida su hogar".Todo indica que la votaciÃ³n del jueves puede resultar favorable a las aspiraciones de unos 200.000 estudiantes indocumentados, que se ven obligados a pagar un precio tres o cuatro veces superior al de los residentes legales por la matrÃ­cula estatal universitaria."Ya pronto me voy a graduar en la escuela secundaria y pensÃ© que no iba a tener ninguna oportunidad de entrar en la universidad, pero si este proyecto se aprueba, tendrÃ© la posibilidad de pagar para ir al 'college' y convertirme en ingeniero", dijo Diego RamÃ­rez, estudiante indocumentado de Homestead, al sur de Florida.La aprobaciÃ³n del proyecto de ley acabarÃ¡ con la prÃ¡ctica de exigir a miles de estudiantes de Florida que "paguen matrÃ­culas para no residentes, simplemente debido a su estatus migratorio o el de sus padres", destacaron las organizaciones Florida's Future, Reform Immigration for America, el Center for Community Change Action y la ACLU.JÃ³venes indocumentados residentes en Tampa, Lakeland, Apopka, Orlando, Miami, Palm Beach, Naples o Homesteasd se desplazaron hasta Tallahassee para presionar a los legisladores en el propio Capitolio de Tallahassee, y realizaron diversos actos para llamar la atenciÃ³n a la opiniÃ³n pÃºblica sobre esta situaciÃ³n, entre otros un "simulacro de ceremonia de graduaciÃ³n" universitaria.De ser aprobado por el Senado, el proyecto de ley ofrecerÃ­a las ventajas de la matrÃ­cula estatal tambiÃ©n a los estudiantes indocumentados que asistieron a una escuela de secundaria en Florida durante tres aÃ±os antes de concluir esos estudios.Antes de ello, los estudiantes deben hacer una declaraciÃ³n jurada de que van a solicitar la regularizaciÃ³n de su estatus migratorio.

Estudio recomienda a Illinois mejorar la ayuda legal a los indocumentados Chicago (IL), 27 mar (EFEUSA).- Las cuarenta organizaciones que ofrecen ayuda legal econÃ³mica a los inmigrantes en Illinois no serÃ­an suficientes en caso de que se apruebe una hipotÃ©tica reforma migratoria, segÃºn un estudio divulgado hoy.En opiniÃ³n de los autores del informe, realizado por el Illinois Immigration Legal Aid Collaborative (IILAC), por cada profesional que ofrece servicios legales de bajo costo hay mÃ¡s de 3.500 inmigrantes indocumentados que necesitan ayuda.El estado deberÃ­a anticiparse a la demanda y prepararse para estar seguros de que los inmigrantes y sus familias se benefician del debido proceso y obtengan ayuda legal cuando lo necesiten, recomienda el estudio."Mientras el Congreso debate la reforma migratoria, en estos momentos hay mucha gente que podrÃ­a ser elegible para algÃºn beneficio si tuviera acceso a un abogado", declarÃ³ Mary Meg McCarthy, miembro de ILLAC y directora ejecutiva del Centro Nacional de Justicia Inmigrante de Chicago."La comunidad debe tener la capacidad de ofrecer servicios legales econÃ³micos para ayudar a que los inmigrantes no sean engaÃ±ados, para que puedan legalizar su estatus y ser miembros productivos de sus comunidades", agregÃ³.IILAC exhortÃ³ a prepararse para la "respuesta masiva que demandarÃ¡ inevitablemente" una hipotÃ©tica reforma migratoria.Con mayor urgencia, seÃ±ala, al acercarse el perÃ­odo de renovaciÃ³n de la AcciÃ³n Diferida, las organizaciones legales comunitarias de Illinois deben estar listas para ofrecer la ayuda necesaria por ser uno de los estados con mayor cantidad de "soÃ±adores" acogidos a este programa gubernamental.El estudio seÃ±ala que esas organizaciones tienen tecnologÃ­a e infraestructura inadecuadas, ademÃ¡s de escasez de personal que limitan su capacidad de enfrentar la demanda adicional.Se hace un llamado ademÃ¡s a organizaciones filantrÃ³picas, municipios y al Gobierno estatal para que aporten los fondos necesarios que permitan "atender las necesidades de las personas que necesiten navegar un sistema migratorio complejo y a menudo disfuncional".El estudio destaca que, a pesar de su estatus legal, los indocumentados de Illinois contribuyeron en 2010 con mÃ¡s de 562 millones de dÃ³lares por el pago de impuestos estatales y locales.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)The Associated PressPARIS –  France's far-right National Front, coming off a historic electoral victory at home, is marching toward a new target: the European Parliament.Party chief Marine Le Pen is leading the charge for continent-wide elections next month like the general of a conquering army, and hoping to attract kindred parties around Europe in a broad alliance.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAs the extreme right rises across Europe, Le Pen wants to seize the momentum — raising the voice of her anti-immigration National Front and amplifying it through a broad parliamentary group. These parties, leveraging public frustration with the EU, want to weaken the bloc's power over European citizens from within Europe's premier legislative institution."My goal is to be first" in France's vote for the European Parliament, "to raise the conscience over what the European Union is making our country live through," she said on French television the morning after her party won a dozen town halls and more than 1,000 city and town council seats in municipal elections.The voting for the 751-seat European Parliament, based in Strasbourg in eastern France, takes place in each of the EU's 28 member states, stretching over four days beginning May 22. Even if far-right groups expand their presence in Parliament, they're unlikely to break the mainstream majority, and their divergent nationalist agendas may clash with each other on the legislative floor.The European Parliament was long derided as a mere talking shop, but it has steadily gained power in recent years and its approval is now needed for all major EU legislation — from financial market regulation to agricultural policies or decisions on how big warning signs on cigarette packs have to be. But the European Parliament falls short of the clout of national legislatures in two important ways: Its lawmakers cannot propose new laws and it has only limited say over the EU's budget.Le Pen's main goal is to use larger numbers in parliament to shift the political discourse toward far-right complaints and establish a long-term foothold.Europe's economic downturn has fueled populist parties of all stripes across the continent, from the United Kingdom Independence Party to Greece's Golden Dawn. But it's not all about the economy: Europeans are in the grips of a chronic identity crisis fed by immigration, largely from former European colonies."The multicultural question, the question of the transformation of the European cultural landscape, notably with the arrival of a Muslim population," said far-right expert Jean-Yves Camus, weigh as heavily on Europe's anxieties as economic frustrations.Le Pen regularly denounces what she calls the EU's rule by "diktat." And she bemoans the perceived consequences of the bloc's single market and open frontiers: high unemployment, plunging purchasing power, unfair trade competition and a general loss of sovereignty.The National Front currently holds three seats in the European Parliament, with Le Pen and her father, party founder Jean Marie Le Pen, holding two of them. She hopes to boost the National Front's European parliamentary presence.She won't give a target figure for seats but experts say the National Front could get up to 20 deputies in the European voting, and foresee strong performances from other European extreme-right parties.After the National Front's success in France's local elections, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi warned that "Europe needs to be aware of the widespread sense of contestation and anti-politics" — and should put growth and fighting joblessness at the center of policymaking.Like the National Front, numerous other far-right parties also target Muslims. They claim that Islamic immigrants stream into their countries to abuse social services and supplant Western culture.Le Pen wants to rally far-right parties around a common anti-EU stance — and create a parliamentary grouping that gives the rightists clout. Groups in the European Parliament receive funding for staff and obtain privileges, from the right to chair committees to more speaking time.But creating a group, which requires at least 25 deputies from seven countries, is no easy task. For one thing, it's still unclear whether the far-right will obtain the numbers necessary to potentially form a group. Then there's the equally difficult task of uniting the parties under one banner.In November, Le Pen joined with the anti-EU, anti-Islam Freedom Party of Dutchman Geert Wilders, who announced plans to "liberate Europe from the monster of Brussels."Yet Wilders' Freedom Party took a hit in February after he offended many Dutch people with a chant of "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" Moroccans in the Netherlands. One of four of the Freedom Party's European deputies quit the party as did three of the group's 15 lawmakers in the Dutch parliament, and the party slipped to second in opinion polls, from first place.Le Pen has been short on details about who else might form a group with her and Wilders — saying only that the excessively extreme positions of Greece's Golden Dawn and Hungary's Jobbik make them unacceptable partners. The high-profile UKIP has refused to join with Wilders and Le Pen, considering their views too extreme.But other parties could be coaxed in, such as Austria's Freedom Party, or FPO, and Italy's Northern League, according to Marco Incerti of the Center for European Policy Studies. Austria's FPO currently leads popularity polls and has 42 seats in the national parliament, although only two seats in the European Parliament.The National Front is launching a European youth movement in Vienna on Friday. It's called the Young European Alliance for Hope — or YEAH — and includes the FPO, Belgium's Vlaams Belang and Sweden Democrats.Some experts say it would be challenging to get inherently inward-looking nationalist parties to cooperate on a European level.And while they share a vision of hostility to the EU, they can be expected to show differences on other issues."Their current agendas are about getting out of Europe," said Incerti, "but there is little cement between them."So far, there is nothing to suggest a far-right group could break the hold of the largest two blocs in parliament: the center-right European People's Party that groups together conservative politicians and has 275 seats, and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, which has 194 seats.However, there is a long-term concern."Five years from now, people could be voting in even larger numbers for such parties," Incerti said.___Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Juergen Baetz in Brussels contributed to this report.___Follow Elaine Ganley on Twitter: Elaine_Ganley. 
Eva Longoria Says The Achievements By Activist Cesar Chavez Have Been Dismantled Actress Eva Longoria showed her more committed side at the Tribeca Film Festival as producer of "Food Chains," a documentary about the abuse farm workers suffer and which, according to her, now means the achievements of Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta have been dismantled.Twenty years after the death of farm workers' leader Cesar Chavez, who in the 1970s led the fight for Latino laborers' rights and formed the United Farm Workers union, Longoria asked the New York festival audience what it is that's making us go backwards.The film documents the six-day hunger strike that members of the UFW went through at the doors of the powerful Publix supermarket chain to demand a 1-cent pay raise for farm workers for every pound of tomatoes they pick.The film also reviews the dark history in the fields from the days of plantation workers when the United States was founded to the massive abuse of farm workers by vast supermarket chains to get the lowest, most competitive prices.The actress, known by most TV viewers for playing Gaby in "Desperate Housewives," said the treatment of field hands in Florida and California is not, contrary to what people think, a subject related to immigration. It's something much deeper, she said, it has to do with human rights."Food Chains" reveals chilling data about the food industry, in which supermarkets alone generate worldwide revenues of some $4 billion a year - but pay field hands an average of $12,000 a year to gather, in the case of tomato harvesters, about 2 tons of food per day.Or as one of the workers in "Food Chains" says, "We're poor so someone can be rich."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Former Homeless Student Receives Prestigious $30K Scholarship RENO, Nev. (AP) –  A University of Nevada, Reno student who was homeless during part of her time attending high school in North Las Vegas has been named the winner of a prestigious national scholarship worth $30,000.Ivon Padilla-Rodriguez is one of only about 60 students in the country who will receive the Harry S. Truman Scholarship. She was among 654 applicants, including students from Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and Duke universities.The money is to be used toward graduate education in law, social work, education, international affairs or public administration, health or policy.Padilla-Rodriguez graduated as a valedictorian from Canyon Springs High School in 2011. The 20-year-old junior at UNR says she hopes to attend law school and eventually become a federal judge and follow in the footsteps of her heroine, Sonia Sotomayor, to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice."I'm going to put this money toward my graduate education, and my ultimate goal is to become a legal advocate for the Latino community," Padilla-Rodriguez told the Reno-Gazette Journal.Emma Sepulveda, director of UNR's Latino Research Center, has served as Padilla-Rodriguez's mentor."Ivon is an amazing young woman," she said. "She's extremely bright, and when she also sees big opportunities, she is extremely focused and she doesn't let anything stop her from getting where she wants to go."Earlier this year, Padilla-Rodriguez was named one of the 10 Top College Women of 2014 by Glamour magazine. She appears in the April 11 edition and, along with a $3,000 scholarship, she will travel with the other winners April 17 to New York City, where she will team up with New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, the nation's first female Hispanic governor. They will take part in workshops and social events hosted by Glamour.Her future didn't always look so bright. For a time during her junior year in high school, Padilla-Rodriguez and her mother were homeless, living out of their car and sleeping on couches belonging to friends and sometimes strangers. Often she would learn of her sleeping arrangement when her mother picked her up from school."For three months, we had to look for somewhere to eat; we had to look for somewhere to sleep," Padilla-Rodriguez told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "My mom would go to Catholic Charities for food."During those days, Padilla-Rodriguez found a safe haven at an after-school improvisational theater program in Las Vegas. In 2012, she co-founded Spotlight, a free improvisational theater program in Reno for youth."There were times that I thought about dropping out of (high) school, but eventually I really realized that for me, school, particularly after-school theater programs, were my big refuge, and they are ultimately what gave me strength," Padilla-Rodriguez said.While studying abroad, she taught improvisational theater to orphans in Costa Rica, Mexico and Cuba.She is one of 60 college students in the nation invited to present her project, "Significance of Comprehensive Immigration Reform for Undocumented Families of Latin American Descent in the U.S." at the 18th annual Posters on the Hill event April 28 and 29 in Washington, D. C.Sepulveda will accompany Padilla-Rodriguez to the nation's capital, where they are scheduled to meet with Nevada's congressional delegates and other political leaders."Ivon is determined to become the next (Sonia) Sotomayor, and I have no doubt she's going to do it," Sepulveda said. "And the wonderful thing is she has never forgotten where she came from. The more she does, the more desire she has to help other people."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Exit Stage Left: School Skit On Immigration Scuttled Following Complaint A classroom skit featuring Uncle Sam and an âuninvited guestâ without a visa has been scuttled by education officials in Maryland following a complaint by a parent.The four-page skit, âThe Uninvited Guestâ by Brenda B. Covert on education website EdHelper.com, details a short story about Uncle Sam and guests at his âCountry Havenâ for a party. After brief pleasantries, the character who serves as a metaphor for the United States quickly makes it known exactly who is welcome.âNo invitations are needed to come to Uncle Samâs Country Haven,â Uncle Sam says. âItâs open to everyone who lives here.âAn invited guest then recalls overhearing something about a âvisa,â according to the supplemental material.âOh, yes. A visa lets people in who donât live here,â Uncle Sam continues. âPeople who want to come for a visit just need to get my approval. If I like them and have the space, I welcome them in. I tell them how long they can stay, and if they want to stay longer, Iâll think it over.âUncle Sam further reiterates that not everyone is invited to the party, particularly those who âsneakâ into it.âOutsiders who pose a threat to the health or safety of my family arenât welcome here,â Uncle Sam continues. âI donât want any drug addicts or drug traffickers to come in, either. No criminals. We have enough problems; we donât need to invite more!âOne complaint from a parent of a student was received in response to the skit last month, according to Max Pugh, a spokesman for Prince Georgeâs County Public Schools. Pugh declined to identify the name of the school or the teacher who assigned the skit, saying the incident was isolated and not indicative of the districtâs curriculum.âThe skit was not performed,â Pugh told FoxNews.com. âIt was poor discretion on behalf of the teacher. It was an isolated incident.âPugh also declined to say whether the teacher was disciplined for distributing âinappropriateâ classroom material. Itâs unclear whether the teacher informed the schoolâs principal about the skit prior to giving it to students, he said. In light of the incident, however, Pugh said district officials will now more closely review supplemental materials prior to disseminating them to its 124,000-plus students, including nearly 50,000 elementary-age children.âWeâre always looking for material that will support our Common Core implementation,â Pugh said in reference to new national academic standards. âAnd if they do not, we will advise them not to use the materials, of course.âThe district, which has more than 200 schools, characterizes itself as a diverse mix of students from urban, rural and suburban communities. More than one-quarter of all students in the district â 27 percent â were born outside of the United States or speak a language other than English at home. More than 22 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, according to its website.The skit was part of a teacherâs social studies lesson plan on immigration in a third-grade gifted-and-talented class, according to a parent of a child who spoke to the Washington Post. The unidentified parent said the teacher obtained the script from EdHelper.com, which bills itself as a âsingle shopâ for educational resources for teachers.Messages seeking comment from the website and the skitâs author were not returned Wednesday. Kenneth Haines, president of the Prince Georgeâs County Educatorsâ Association, declined to discuss the skit, referring calls to Pugh. The National Education Association did not return phone calls.The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, meanwhile, said the U.S. Constitution offers school officials wide discretion on materials used in the classroom."The Constitution gives school officials broad latitude to control what materials are used and how lessons are taught in the classroom, in contrast to the limits the First Amendment places on their ability to censor student speech," the organization said in a statement to FoxNews.com. "The actions taken by Prince George's County Schools in connection with the play appear to relate to their control over the classroom, rather than an attempt to censor student speech, and thus do not appear unlawful."Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa of Maryland, a community group founded by Central American refugees and immigrants, was unavailable to comment on Wednesday, but said he was pleased the district responded appropriately to the âhorrendousâ material.âThe play is horrible,â Torres told the Washington Post. âIt is racist.âFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Former NYC Mayor Bloomberg Group Rolls Out Ads Pushing Immigration Reform Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg may be out of office, but at least one project he actively participated in is still going strong.A group he backs, the Partnership for a New American Economy, is rolling out an ad campaign to push Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year.The commercials are to appear in inside taxicabs in the nation’s capital, , according to USA Today, with the objective that constituents and members of Congress will see them and be motivated to act on a reform measure.“Immigrants invented many of the things we use every day,” a female narrator says. “Without them, America wouldn’t be America.”The ads mention businesses begun by immigrants, among them Levi Strauss of blue jeans fame, who came from Germany and Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is from Russia.Bloomberg’s organization also includes News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO and president.The commercials also will run online and on television.USA Today quoted John Feinblatt, the group’s chairman, as saying the “lack of action on immigration reform is causing American industries to lose their competitive edge.”Last June the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure that, among other things, tightened border security, expanded foreign worker visas and provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But the effort has stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority and several of them have vowed not to pass a bill that gives amnesty to people who have broken immigration laws.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Expertas en inmigraciÃ³n piden perseguir mÃ¡s a quienes empleen indocumentados Austin (TX), 10 abr (EFEUSA).- Expertas acadÃ©micas en materia de inmigraciÃ³n plantearon durante la Cumbre de Derechos Civiles en Austin (Texas) que las autoridades de EE.UU. persigan mÃ¡s a quienes emplean a inmigrantes indocumentados, en vez de concentrar las represalias sobre los trabajadores en situaciÃ³n irregular.Durante la Cumbre de Derechos Civiles, que ha conmemorado desde el martes y hasta este jueves el cincuenta aniversario de la ley que prohibiÃ³ la discriminaciÃ³n en la naciÃ³n, varios polÃ­ticos, acadÃ©micos y activistas plantearon diferentes aspectos que deberÃ­a incluir una futura reforma del sistema de inmigraciÃ³n."Podemos poner todos los recursos militares que queramos en la frontera que, si la gente sigue consiguiendo trabajo, encontrarÃ¡n la manera de poder entrar (de manera clandestina)", dijo a Efe la profesora Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, de la Escuela de Asuntos PÃºblicos Lyndon B. Johnson de Austin.Para De Francesco, los inmigrantes no llegarÃ­an a Estados Unidos si las empresas no les dieran trabajo, aunque sea de manera irregular, pero en cambio el sistema para perseguir la inmigraciÃ³n clandestina se concentra principalmente en el trabajador.La profesora cree que las multas para las empresas que contempla la ley no se han implementado "de manera energÃ©tica". "TambiÃ©n hay algunas inspecciones sorpresa pero no son nada consistentes", sostiene.Denise Gilman, miembro del centro jurÃ­dico Immigration Clinic de la Universidad de Texas, cree que este es un "problema perpetuado" desde la reforma migratoria de 1986, bajo la AdministraciÃ³n de Ronald Reagan."La idea bÃ¡sica fue que impondrÃ­an sanciones a los empleadores, lo que reducirÃ­a la demanda de indocumentados en las empresas y asÃ­ quedarÃ­a ya resuelto. Pero no pasÃ³ de esta manera", analizÃ³ para Efe la experta, en un momento en que se calcula que hay 11 millones de personas que viven en Estados Unidos de manera irregular.En opiniÃ³n de Gilman, la falta de presiÃ³n contra los empresarios convierte a los trabajadores indocumentados en mÃ¡s vulnerables porque "los empleadores pueden amenazarlos con llamar a las autoridades migratorias por cualquier excusa".Por eso, tanto DeFrancesco como Gilman creen que una futura reforma legal del sistema de inmigraciÃ³n deberÃ­a incluir mÃ¡s acciones contra los empresarios que contratan a los indocumentados.En este sentido, Martha Menchaca, profesora de AntropologÃ­a, aÃ±adiÃ³ que es importante que la soluciÃ³n legal para los indocumentados sea mediante una reforma migratoria integral - y no una ley puntual- para que los trabajadores del campo queden tambiÃ©n incluidos."Hay voces que solo quieren abordar inmigraciÃ³n para aquellos profesionales que trabajan en el paÃ­s con los visados laborales y quieren dejar a los trabajadores del campo fuera de esta soluciÃ³n y convertirlos en mÃ¡s vulnerables que nadie", indicÃ³ a Efe en Austin.

Experts Differ On Electability Of Buddies Sen. Marco Rubio And Ex-Gov. Jeb Bush If They Run For President In 2016 They’re friends, are fellow Miamians, and have a mentor-mentee relationship.But if U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and his mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, were to run against each other in the Republican presidential primary in 2016, who would have an edge?Some believe Bush would, given his political pedigree, have the advantage when it comes to getting GOP support, Latino votes, and funds from major donors, among other things.“There wouldn’t be any question that Jeb Bush would be the stronger candidate,” said Fernand Amandi, executive director of the Miami-based public opinion research firm Bendixen and Amandi.“He is the most capable of the Republicans,” Amandi said, referring to those in the GOP who have been mentioned as potential 2016 contenders. "He is a unique Republican who can appeal to the conservative wing of the party, the moderate wing, and he can make a claim to win over a larger percent of Hispanic votes.”Amandi said that Bush is field-tested, and has a long track record.“He is established,” he said, “from a policy perspective.”By comparison, Amandi said, Rubio remains something of an enigma, particularly to the conservative base, who criticized the junior senator for his central role in the passage in June of a bipartisan Senate immigration reform measure that included a pathway to citizenship for people who are here illegally.“Rubio was relatively unknown in conservative circles” outside Florida before he became a U.S. senator, Amandi said.“The immigration reform bill was the first betrayal of what they thought” Rubio stood for, he said.But other political observers believe Rubio is more electable, and surely more likely to win a Republican primary than Bush.Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that promotes conservative values and ideals within the Latino community, believes Rubio is seriously leaning toward running in 2016.Neither Rubio nor Bush have said they are running, only that they have not yet decided.“If you look at all the different [GOP] potential presidential candidates, he’ll be ready if he had to announce tomorrow in terms of his campaign infrastructure,” said Aguilar, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush as chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship.“Jeb has the interest [in running],” said Aguilar, who knows both Rubio and Bush, “but in the past even though he had the interest he avoided it because of family reasons.”“The establishment is without a candidate – Chris Christie hurt himself,” Aguilar said, “not because of the issue of the [George Washington] bridge itself, but because the issue uncovered who he is.”Some observers believe that because of the close relationship that Rubio and Bush have, if one really wants to run in 2016, the other will not.Rubio recently said, however, that Bush’s decision about whether to go for the GOP nomination in 2016 will not influence his own inclination to run or not.“In terms of my decision-making for next year, it will be based on me – not on anybody else,” Rubio said in an interview with Politico when asked about the prospects of a Bush candidacy. “And I think that’s true for anyone thinking about it – including himself,” he said.“It’s not that unusual to see people who have been allies in the past end up running for an office like that,” he added.Be that as it may, some experts believe that if Bush really wants to run, Rubio, who is 42, will defer, given that the former governor is 61 and this could be his last chance.If Bush were to run, though, he’d have to gain credibility with the conservative base, Aguilar said.“The one who really needs to tweak his message and improve his chances in the primary is, ironically, Jeb,” Aguilar said.That is because the conservative segment sees Bush as an establishment Republican – something that this group sees as another face of Big Government.“They don’t want someone they think will continue growing the federal government, and government spending,” Aguilar said.Many conservatives see Bush as too close to big business and Wall Street.“Marco has a better connection with the base, he has cross-over appeal, he has establishment GOP support,” Aguilar said.Bush would get more of the Latino vote, both Amandi and Aguilar agree.“He could get more than 40 percent of Latino voters,” Amandi said, besting even his brother’s impressive win of more than 40 percent of Latino support in 2004.Someone who could do well with both Latinos and establishment Republicans, and even conservatives, Aguilar said, is neither Bush nor Rubio – it’s Texas Gov. Rick Perry.Perry, who unsuccessfully pursued the GOP nomination in 2012 presidential election, said he would not seek re-election as governor, but has been making presidential candidate-like moves, observers say.He delivered a strong speech at the key conservative annual gathering – CPAC – earlier this year.“His speech was by far the best at CPAC,” Aguilar said.“Rick Perry entered the race too late last time, this time he’s starting early,” he said.Recently, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican who is a friend of both Rubio and Bush, said she would support Bush in 2016 if he ran.She dismissed the notion that Rubio would run against Bush. In an interview with The Hill, she touted Bush’s electability, though added: "Maybe some folks don't think that [Bush is] as conservative as he should be, but he's a very pragmatic conservative and compassionate man as well.”Later, Ros-Lehtinen, for whom Rubio had been an intern, tweeted: "I'm w/Marco also. Wasn't either/or. Both."The Democrats, for their part, said whether Rubio or Bush runs, it would be a distinction without a difference.“It doesn’t matter who the Republican Party nominates in 2016 if the GOP continues to support policies that are bad for the middle class,” said Pili Tobar, a press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. “The GOP is obsessed with repealing health care for millions of Americans, and still blocking immigration reform, a minimum wage increase and the Paycheck Fairness Act.”“No matter who the Republican nominee is, they represent the party of offensive rhetoric, and of hurtful policies for everyday Americans.”Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Ex-US Rep. Mel Reynolds deported from Zimbabwe, pays $100 fine for flouting immigration law HARARE, Zimbabwe –  Lawyers for former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds say he was deported to the U.S. after a paying a fine for violating Zimbabwe's immigration laws.Attorney Arthur Gurira said Monday that Reynolds left Zimbabwe Sunday afternoon.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTA Harare magistrate Friday ordered Reynolds to pay a $100 fine or five days' imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to flouting the country's immigration laws by staying longer than his visa permitted.Reynolds, 62, who lost his Illinois congressional seat in 1995 after being convicted of statutory rape, was arrested at a Harare hotel on Feb. 17.He also faced charges of possessing pornography after images of naked men and women were found on his iPhone. Those charges were dismissed Friday because the judge ruled the police did not have a proper prosecution order. 
Mark Zuckerberg: Immigration 'One Of The Biggest Civil Rights Issues Of Our Time' Echoing activists who are pushing for a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s millions of undocumented immigrants, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said that overhauling U.S. immigration laws is a modern-day civil rights issue.Zuckerberg, who has been an increasingly vocal advocate for more flexible immigration laws, said in an interview on ABC News' “This Week” that many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States come with noble objectives. The 29-year-old billionaire said they should be given an opportunity to legalize their status.His advocacy efforts on immigration have focused on the expansion of visas for high-tech workers and a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.“When you meet these children who are really talented, and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that, but they don’t have the opportunities that … we all enjoy, it’s really heartbreaking – right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time,” Zuckerberg said in the interview.Zuckerberg just hosted a marathon computer coding session for 20 undocumented immigrants – made up generally of college students – who beat out hundreds of applicants for a chance to participate in the so-called “hackathon.” The immigrants, known as “Dreamers” after the DREAM Act – a proposed federal measure that gives legal residency to certain qualifying young immigrants – worked with engineers and coders from various companies to develop programs targeted at immigration reform.Zuckerberg and others – such as Dropbox and LinkedIn top executives – then picked three winning projects from about eight that were presented by the immigrant teams. Those winning teams will receive technological support to develop the ideas.That outreach by Zuckerberg has won plaudits from many immigrant advocates, but the president of the union representing immigration enforcement officers criticized the Facebook chief executive for not responding to the group’s request for a meeting and for rewarding lawbreakers.“Earlier this month, we sent a letter to the major CEOs pushing a comprehensive immigration plan asking that they meet with ICE officers,” said Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, in a statement.One of those on the letter was Mark Zuckerberg. . . Mr. Zuckerberg ignored the letter and meeting request from ICE law enforcement and instead met with illegal immigrants.”“We respectfully renew our request to meet with Mr. Zuckerberg and share firsthand the knowledge and experience of ICE officers and agents. . .Until Mr. Zuckerberg meets with officers and learns the truth about our immigration system, I would respectfully suggest he suspend his lobbying activities."In the ABC News interview, Zuckerberg said the United States would benefit from making its immigration laws more flexible.“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy. And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here,” Zuckerberg said in the interview.As for the undocumented immigrants who lack high-tech skills or college degrees, Zuckerberg said they raise the children who end up talented enough to keep the United States globally competitive.“One of the things that the ‘Dreamers’ here today show is that even if, you know, you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers … you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said, referring to the participants of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.” 
Faith Knows No Bounds: Catholic Bishops Celebrate Mass On U.S.-Mexico Border NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) –  Roman Catholic leaders made a rare visit to the border and celebrated Mass on Tuesday in the shadow of the fence separating the U.S. and Mexico, offering Holy Communion through the steel barrier to people on the Mexican side as they sought to bring attention to the plight of immigrants.Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the leader of the Boston Archdiocese, led a delegation of bishops from around the country and Mexico in the trip to the border, less than a week after President Barack Obama discussed immigration reform in a meeting with Pope Francis. They toured the border city of Nogales, walked along a notorious section of the border that was once a popular crossing point for drug and immigrant smugglers, and celebrated Mass just a few feet from the fence.The Catholic leaders believe that immigration is a humanitarian issue that deserves urgent attention by Congress. They cite the dozens of immigrants who die each year in the brutal desert terrain while trying to cross illegally into the United States along the roughly 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico and note that the immigrants are simply trying to find better lives in America."This is not just a political or economic problem," O'Malley said Tuesday. "This is a moral problem."Several hundred people attended the Mass, which was translated into Spanish, and a few dozen people peered through the border fence from Mexico to watch the ceremony. O'Malley and Bishop Gerald Kicanas of the Tucson Diocese offered Holy Communion through the fence, providing people in Mexico wafers as a blessing as some of the recipients broke down in tears.During the Mass, the clergymen laid a wreath at the border wall to remember those who have died. It followed a similar event in Lampedusa, Italy, last year when the pope threw a wreath into the Mediterranean Sea to remember migrants who have died attempting to reach Europe.The push for immigration reform in Congress has been stalled for months, with Democrats and Republicans unable to reach an agreement over the divisive issue.House Democrats last week tried to force a vote on a comprehensive immigration bill, an effort that is likely to fail given Republican reluctance to address the topic in an election year while all signs point to major gains for the GOP in the November midterms.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June, but the measure stalled in the GOP-controlled House, where Republicans have argued for a piecemeal approach to reforming the system.Arizona state Sen. Al Melvin, a Republican running for governor, said the clergy visit will do little to solve problems on the border. He said developing private-sector jobs in northern Mexico and securing the border to prevent drug and human trafficking are needed to bring stability to both sides of the international boundary."Frankly, and I am a Catholic, I think this is irresponsible of these bishops to be down there," Melvin said. "They are not bringing stability to the border. They are adding to the chaos of the border. And it's not helping to save lives. If anything, I believe it will contribute to more lives being lost. We need to secure the border to protect lives."During his first meeting with Pope Francis last week at the Vatican, Obama expressed his interest in getting immigration reform through Congress, explaining during a news conference that "there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.""And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he (Pope Francis) is very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported and are separated from families," Obama said.Mike Fleming traveled from Tucson to attend the Mass and voiced his support for the message of the Catholic leaders."Someday in my lifetime I hope this comes down," Fleming said. "We're all one people. As Christians, we're all one people under God. There's no need for this wall."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Fallo de tribunal de Tennessee podrÃ­a afectar a inmigrantes con antecedentes delictivos NASHVILLE, Tennessee, EE.UU. –  La Corte Suprema de Tennessee emitiÃ³ el viernes una decisiÃ³n que podrÃ­a ser un golpe para inmigrantes a quienes nunca se les dijo que pueden deportarlos por delitos que ha sido borrados de sus antecedentes penales.El caso pone al descubierto una desavenencia entre la ley federal y la estatal cuando se trata de antecedentes penales eliminados de los expedientes, seÃ±alaron defensores de los derechos de inmigrantes.El fallo unÃ¡nime del viernes por parte del mÃ¡ximo tribunal estatal resultÃ³ en que el tribunal se negÃ³ a reabrir el caso de un inmigrante que se declarÃ³ culpable de solicitar los servicios de una prostituta a cambio de que las autoridades borraran su condena por un delito menor.La decisiÃ³n cancela la posibilidad de que inmigrantes puedan corregir una mala asesorÃ­a jurÃ­dica en el pasado, dijo Tricia Herzfeld, abogada del bufete Ozment Law, que presentÃ³ la solicitud a nombre del National Immigration ProjectUn inmigrante puede conseguir que los tribunales de Tennessee le borre un antecedente penal, pero incluso asÃ­ es posible que un tribunal use esa condena para decidir si lo deporta, seÃ±alÃ³ Herzfeld.Muchos abogados penales no tienen conocimiento de la ley de inmigraciÃ³n y no advierten a sus clientes que si se declaran culpables de un delito y esa condena es eliminada posteriormente por un tribunal, sigue existiendo la posibilidad de que el gobierno federal la use para propÃ³sitos de inmigraciÃ³n.La mayorÃ­a de las personas cuyos antecedentes penales han sido eliminados por lo general cometieron delitos menores, como vandalismo y robo, pero incluso asÃ­ podrÃ­a tener consecuencias desastrosas en un tribunal de inmigraciÃ³n, dijo Herzfeld."Cosas que parecen realmente menores podrÃ­an tener consecuencias realmente significativas", seÃ±alÃ³. "PodrÃ­a significar la diferencia entre que lo deportaciÃ³n o no".El caso es el de un ciudadano mexicano que se declarÃ³ culpable en un tribunal de Nashville en 2007 por un cargo de solicitar los servicios de una prostituta. A cambio de su declaraciÃ³n de culpabilidad, se permitiÃ³ a JosÃ© RodrÃ­guez tener un registro de antecedentes delictivos limpio siempre y cuando acatara las Ã³rdenes de la corte.En 2010 la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos decidiÃ³ que la ConstituciÃ³n exige que los abogados defensores informen a sus clientes que no sean ciudadanos estadounidenses que una declaraciÃ³n de culpabilidad podrÃ­a tener consecuencias para su estatus de inmigraciÃ³n. RodrÃ­guez acudiÃ³ a la corte en 2010 y solicitÃ³ retirar su declaraciÃ³n de culpabilidad, argumentando que nadie le dijo que incluso con la eliminaciÃ³n de sus antecedentes penales su estatus inmigratorio pudiera resultar afectado.___ http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2013/reforma-migratoria/

(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon, File)The Associated PressHENIN-BEAUMONT, France –  Marine Le Pen sees political gold in the abandoned coal mines of northern France that once pumped life, jobs and an identity into places like Henin-Beaumont — a bleak town that the far-right leader says is the avant-garde of her anti-immigration party's march to power.Le Pen has been digging the terrain of discontent around France, and in Henin-Beaumont — a Socialist bastion for decades — she is counting on a win in municipal elections that begin Sunday, the first of a string of electoral tests she hopes will catapult her National Front to the forefront of French political life.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTLe Pen's party, which disdains the European Union and globalization and fears that Islamic culture will subvert French civilization, is aiming to leverage the municipal vote to build a grassroots base upon which to draw ahead of May elections for the European Parliament and the French presidential vote in 2017. She wants to officially scrub away the racist stigma that has long clung to the National Front and ultimately to upend the French political system by winning broad support for the party's "patriotic" doctrine.Le Pen told The Associated Press in an interview that, while local concerns are at the center of the municipal vote, the National Front will ensure that party priorities like secularism are respected where it wins. That could be a potential flashpoint for conflict in towns with large Muslim populations where some groups seek to build mosques or serve halal food in school cafeterias."We don't have problems with Islam," she said, while adding: "France has Christian roots. (The French) want to recognize their own country, recognize their lifestyle, their habits, their traditions."And the fringes of her movement cause concern.Several neophyte candidates have posed in front of Nazi flags, prompting belated criticism from Le Pen. And this week, nearly two dozen militants from the hard-right Bloc Identitaire — which has no official ties with the National Front but is seen as a source of ideas for the party — patrolled public transport in the major northern city of Lille, a Socialist stronghold near Henin-Beaumont, Europe 1 radio reported.The March 23 and 30 elections for mayors and town councilors could shake up the profile of many of France's 36,000 villages, towns and cities, most significantly in Paris. The nation's crown jewel will be getting its first female mayor as two women vie for the job, Socialist Anne Hidalgo and rival conservative Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet.The National Front hopes to benefit from widespread disappointment in the forces that have dominated French politics for decades. Scandals are engulfing former President Nicolas Sarkozy and his fractious conservative party. Meanwhile the Socialists, who wrested major cities from Sarkozy's UMP in the last local elections in 2008, are suffering from President Francois Hollande's deep unpopularity and a government that has failed to create jobs or improve the economy."The system fears our vote, our choice for change," Le Pen said at a rally in a packed hall in Henin-Beaumont last week. She was there to support her party's mayoral candidate, Steeve Briois, but made clear the local vote carries a national message."The municipal elections have an essential role, to give hope to the French," she said. "You are the avant garde, the first to witness with rage in your hearts" all that is wrong with France.With a dearth of trained officials, the National Front cannot compete on equal footing with leading parties. But it is still is running candidates in 596 towns — a party record. Even winning a handful of local municipalities would represent a sharp disavowal of mainstream politics. And with or without mayoral wins, Le Pen hopes to use good scores to put 1,000 councilors into city governments and thereby influence policies.The National Front "is the only revolutionary party in France today," said Patrick Martinez, 50, holding a Bloc Identitaire banner at a recent anti-Islam protest march in Paris. He said he would vote National Front in his Lyon hometown because "we have nothing better today."Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault urged voters this week to "do everything" to keep National Front candidates from reaching city halls. In Henin-Beaumont, the League of Human Rights distributed tracts warning of the "danger" of a National Front victory.Lucien Davril, 51, predicted increased tensions in the town with a National Front win. "There will be lots of damage, windows broken, cars burned," said Davril, who works at a sporting goods store, refusing to say who would get his vote.Muslims in the town refused to comment to visiting reporters, in an apparent sign of growing concern.The red brick town of Henin-Beaumont, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Paris with a population of 26,000, is a perfect showcase for the National Front. Dark, eerily majestic hills of coal refuse, known as terrils, dot the horizon, a reminder of an economically vibrant past when coal was king. French laborers and immigrants from Europe and Muslim North Africa flocked to the area in the 19th century for back-breaking coal mining, famously depicted in Emile Zola's "Germinal."Today, the unemployment rate is nearing 18 percent, many shops in the nearly lifeless town center are shuttered and people complain loudly about crime. Polls show the leftist workers' bastion is likely heading for a far-right flip-flop — after former mayor Gerard Dalongeville was convicted of embezzling public funds and left the town with a huge deficit. Dalongeville, appealing his conviction, is running again. So is current Mayor Eugene Benaisse, supported by the Socialists.National Front candidate Briois is trying to win over voters with promises to install security surveillance cameras in the town, make police work nights and create a rapid-action police unit."We have locks and bolts everywhere," said 85-year-old widow Charlene Boduain, showing a scarred finger from an attack last year in a parking lot. Asked if she will vote for the FN candidate, she replied: "Yes, it is more than certain," adding that the far right is "better suited" to handling security matters.National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen made it to the final round of presidential elections in 2002 but was crushed in the runoff. The party, financially strapped from the presidential fight, did poorly in the 2008 municipal elections.Along came Marine Le Pen, Jean-Marie's daughter. A 45-year-old mother of three, she took over the National Front in 2010, working to clean its racist and anti-Semitic image and shoo away jack-booted followers in an attempt to make it a legitimate political alternative, not just a catch-all for protest votes.She's been so successful that her party's tirades against Muslim immigration are mimicked on the right and, more subtly, on the left. Marine Le Pen placed a strong third in the 2012 presidential race, and the National Front won two parliamentary seats.High unemployment and crime rates, corruption, and a visible Muslim population, are like calling cards for the National Front — and the extreme right elsewhere in Europe. Switzerland's recent winning referendum to cap immigration was a morale boost for the National Front and extreme-right parties across Europe.Le Pen told The AP that she thought Islamic Sharia law would take over French justice within three decades if "mass immigration" wasn't stopped.The National Front would run towns it wins "like a good father," she assured, hoping for victories in southern France, including towns where the party's parliament members are implanted.But some remember four extreme-right victories in southern France in 1995 municipal elections, and worry. Corruption, deficits and bids to impose National Front ideology, such as banning books from libraries and adding National Front literature, proved disastrous.Under the National Front, Henin-Beaumont would likely implement mainstream policies to provide a sanitized window to the broader French electorate."The martyred city of Henin-Beaumont, you will be the renaissance of France," she told the crowd at her final rally there. "You will show that another kind of politics is possible."___Follow Ganley on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/Elaine_Ganley 
Fast-Changing Districts Could Impact November Elections As GOP Works To Neutralize Immigration Reform AURORA, Colo. (AP) –  If the apparent slow death of immigration legislation has any political repercussions this year, they probably will be felt in the subdivisions, shopping centers and ethnic eateries wrapped around Denver's southern end.U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman represents this fast-changing district.He's among a few vulnerable Republican members in line to be targeted by immigrant rights advocates if the House doesn't pass an immigration bill before the November election that would offer legal status to millions of people who entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.The issue is no easy solution for Democrats needing to gain 17 seats to win back the House majority. Democratic campaign officials are focusing on about two dozen GOP-held seats where immigration could be a factor, but they rank only nine in the top tier of possible pickups.Immigration advocates acknowledge their impact on House races this year is limited. Most Republicans hold safe seats in districts with relatively low numbers of immigrants. Coffman is one of the most vulnerable incumbents, but the three-term lawmaker's shift on the issue illustrates the difficulties Democrats may have.Coffman was elected in 2008 to succeed immigration firebrand Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo. Coffman endorsed Tancredo in the 2010 governor's race, which he lost, and initially backed measures such as barring U.S. citizenship to children whose parents were in the country without legal permission. Coffman also supported allowing English-only ballots in districts with large immigrant populations.But his district was redrawn to include immigrant-heavy Aurora. After seeing fast-growing Hispanic and Asian populations overwhelmingly back Democrats in 2012, Coffman embraced citizenship for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. He announced his new position in Spanish.Coffman stopped short of backing a broader proposal to legalize more of the people in the country illegally, but he was one of the few House Republicans at a recent party meeting in Maryland to urge his colleagues to pursue an immigration bill.Seeing major divisions within the GOP and saying that Republicans don't trust President Barack Obama to enforce the law, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last month that immigration legislation is unlikely to reach the House floor until after the election."The fact that immigration reform has disappeared kind of takes it off the table," said Floyd Ciruli, a nonpartisan Denver-based pollster. Coffman "is doing everything he can to make it a less salient issue," Ciruli said.Obama took Coffman's district by 5 percentage points in 2012, while Coffman by only 2 points. One-fifth of the congressman's constituents are Hispanic, 10 percent are black, and political registration is evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and independents."I'm still working for immigration reform," Coffman said in an interview.Coffman says his change of heart on immigration dates from discussions with young people in the country illegally who cannot join the military or go to college."I really believe that the strongest expression of American citizenship is serving this country in uniform," said Coffman, a Marine Corps and Army veteran. He's proposed granting citizenship to any young person here illegally who enlists.In addition to studying Spanish, Coffman has also spent time in his district's numerous other immigrant communities. Last month he visited an Ethiopian church. But he says he does not support an immigration bill passed by the Senate and prefers more steps to ensure the border is secure before granting legal status.Some who question his sincerity note that last year Coffman voted to end Obama's policy of granting work permits to people brought to the country illegally when they were young. The step could have led to deporting some of the people Coffman wants to aid in his military bill. Coffman said he objected to Obama's putting the program in place on his own, and that he preferred Congress act."He's saying the right things and we welcome that," said Jesus Altamirano of the National Council of La Raza. "But he's telling us one thing and voting another."Coffman remains a member of the Immigration Reform Caucus, a group founded by Tancredo that is steered by Republican congressmen who have been vocal opponents of letting those in the country illegally gain citizenship.Support for a path to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally is popular in Colorado. A recent poll showed 59 percent of the state's voters back it.Republicans in other high-immigrant districts might be even more vulnerable. In California, U.S. Reps. Jeff Denham and David Valadao have signed on to a Democratic resolution urging House passage of the Senate's immigration bill. Denham announced his support on Spanish-language television.Frank Sharry of the Washington-based immigration advocacy group America's Voice said the issue will be more formidable in 2016, when the presidential election is expected to bring out more Hispanic voters and there will be a clearer contrast on the issue.But Sharry said that Republicans like Coffman are fair game. The message to immigrant and Hispanic voters, Sharry said, will be: "He's ineffective. He can't get his party to stop screwing you."Izzy Santa of the Republican National Committee scoffed at the notion that immigration could be used against Coffman and others. "They're the members who are trying to move the issue forward," Santa said.Republicans are going after Coffman's Democratic challenger, former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, on the issue.The National Republican Congressional Committee released a Web ad last year chiding Romanoff for helping pass legislation in 2006 that Democrats boasted was the toughest package against illegal immigration in the country. The proposals barred people here illegally from receiving non-emergency benefits, and were criticized by some Republicans for not being stringent enough.Democrats are frustrated at the attack. They say Romanoff has long supported immigration reform.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

Father Of California Girl Who Met With Pope Francis Released From Immigration Detention LOS ANGELES (AP) –  After a 10-year-old California girl traveled to the Vatican to plead with Pope Francis for help as her father faced deportation, the man was released Friday on bond from immigration detention.Mario Vargas was freed from a detention facility in Louisiana after he posted $5,000 bond. A relative who saw the girl on television pleading with the pope during a public audience helped with the funding, said his wife, Lola Vargas."When she left, her wish was that her father would be home," she told The Associated Press in Spanish. "Thank God she is going to get her wish."Mario Vargas' release came after his daughter Jersey, of Panorama City, Calif., addressed the pope this week as part of a California delegation that traveled to urge the Vatican to prod President Barack Obama on immigration reform. The girl and a teenager went as part of the 16-member group to represent the American children of immigrant parents who are afraid their families will be divided by deportation. The president and the pontiff met for the first time Thursday."I feel very happy and proud because I'm finally going to have my dad back and we're going to be reunited," Jersey told the AP late Friday before boarding a flight from Rome to Los Angeles.She said her father was also heading to Los Angeles, and that she hoped he would get there before her arrival Saturday."I haven't seen him in two years," she said. "It's been very hard since my dad hasn't been home. My mom has had to be the provider for my family, she's been the mother and father for two years."Mario Vargas was arrested last year in Tennessee and convicted of driving under the influence before he was taken into federal custody earlier this month, said Bryan Cox, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Authorities released him after he posted bond, and an immigration judge will determine the outcome of his deportation case, Cox said.Lola Vargas said she had been gathering money to pay for her Mexican husband's bond but didn't have enough until one of his cousins called, surprised to see the girl on television, and offered to help. Her husband had gone to Tennessee to look for work in construction and had been sending money to his family in California, she said.A message left for Vargas' immigration attorney, Alex Galvez, seeking comment was not immediately returned.Juan Jose Gutierrez, an immigrant advocate who coordinated the trip to Italy, said the archdiocese of Los Angeles helped get the group a key spot so they could speak with Pope Francis amid the crowds.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
FBI says Moroccan man spoke of radio-controlled plane bombs targeting school, federal building BRIDGEPORT, Conn. –  Federal officials say they've arrested a Moroccan national in Connecticut who expressed interest in using radio-controlled airplanes to bomb a school and a federal building.A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office says 27-year-old El Mehdi Semlali Fathi was arrested Monday by the FBI on immigration-related charges.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTFathi is charged criminally for allegedly staying in the U.S. for seven years after his student visa expired after flunking out of Virginia International University. Authorities are still investigating alleged statements that he intended to carry out bombings.The FBI says Fathi spoke on recorded conversations about a desire to bomb an out-of-state school and a federal building in Connecticut. The exact locations weren't released.Fathi is detained without bail. His public defender declined to comment Tuesday. 
Fearing Rape, Female Migrants Are Taking Birth Control Before Crossing The Border MEXICO CITY –  As a priest in the town of Altar, near the Arizona border, the Rev. Prisciliano Pedraza sees migrants stocking up on supplies such as food, water and medicine for treacherous treks through the desert.But he sees female migrants stocking up on something else: contraceptives, which they take preventatively to protect themselves against sexual violence all too common as they make the journey through Mexico to the United States. “The women passing through here know that they’re going to be raped,” said Father Pedraza, director of a shelter for migrants in Altar. “Migrants are a vulnerable group, and the most vulnerable among them are women.”Thousands of Central Americans travel through Mexico every year attempting to reach the United States. But because they make the trip illegally, they are vulnerable to kidnappings, extortion and robbery – with organized criminal groups such as Los Zetas often acting in cahoots with law enforcement authorities. In the case of women, the crimes include sexual assaults, forcing them to take precautions. They often take alternative routes through Mexico, feigning friendships with men in their group to stay safe while traveling. Increasingly, they are buying and consuming contraceptives before they make their trip.“It’s on the increase,” says Marta Sánchez Soler, an advocate with the MesoAmerican Migrants Movement. “The first ones (doing it) were women from El Salvador, but now it’s everyone.” Many contraceptives are sold without a prescription in Mexico, including the morning-after pill. Sánchez says some women receive injections before leaving or wear patches. “They go to the pharmacy and buy emergency contraception for their trip to Mexico. This is they would tell us.”Most church groups don’t supply the contraceptives – or condone what the women do, but they do help the women in other ways.“They’re not giving it out, but they’re offering advice,” Sánchez said.A network of shelters for migrants stretches the length of Mexico – with most run by Catholic priests and religious, who report being queried about contraceptives by women arriving as guests. “They’ll arrive at the shelters and ask the priests or people that work there” about buying contraceptives, says Alberto Xicotencatl, director of the diocesan-run migrant shelter in Saltillo, 195 miles from the Texas border at Nuevo Laredo. But women are less likely than men to stay at migrant shelters, which are often established near railway lines and frequented by Central Americans stealing rides on northbound trains known as “La Bestia,” or, “The Beast” – so named for the way it maims migrants who fall on the tracks and lose limbs. Women attempt to avoid La Bestia, which organized crime now charges $100 to climb aboard, according to Xicotencatl. Criminal groups also prey on migrants while they wait in railway yards for trains to arrive. “They would rather risk the immigration authorities than organized crime,” he says.Women, unlike their male counterparts, often arrive in Mexico with more money from their families and hire human smugglers to take them north. In some situations, women will form a relationship with fellow migrants and pretend to be traveling as couples, Father Pedraza says. Still, incidents of sexual assault are common. Father Pedraza puts the figure at 90 percent of all female migrants, but the number is impossible to know. Father Alejandro Solalinde, operator of a shelter in the Istmo region of southern Oaxaca state, says the figure has dropped somewhat to perhaps 40 percent, due to increased enforcement in the southern state of Chiapas. A 2011 survey by the National Public Health Institute at a shelter for migrants in the southern border city of Tapachula found 8.3 percent of women saying they had been raped, while 9.2 percent reported inappropriate touching. Some 28.2 percent said they traded sex for some sort of service or favor – such as northbound rides from truckers or bus drivers.The Border Patrol arrested a man last year after a 14-year-old girl in Arizona reported she was raped by a “coyote,” or the person who smuggled her into the United States. And a Border Patrol agent, Esteban Manzanares, apparently killed himself after he was accused of kidnapping and raping three undocumented women in Texas.Reliable statistics on border rapes do not exist, says Gretchen Kuhner, director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI) in Mexico, in part, because researchers inadvertently ask the wrong questions. “When we did the interviews in the detention centers, women don’t even consider being pressured to have sex by the bus driver or truck driver … they don’t consider that sexual violence,” she says. “It’s really hard to ask women about that.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Federal authorities find 2 lengthy smuggling tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico SAN DIEGO –  U.S. authorities say a task force working with Mexican counterparts discovered two cross-border smuggling tunnels stretching hundreds of yard between Tijuana and an industrial park in San Diego.A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement Friday says a woman from Chula Vista, Calif., was arrested for allegedly overseeing logistics at a warehouse where one of the tunnels surfaced in San Diego.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe first tunnel, stretching about 600 yards, was discovered on Tuesday. Authorities say it was equipped with lighting, a crude rail system and wooden trusses.The other tunnel was discovered Thursday. It's described as stretching more than 700 yards and more sophisticated, with an electric rail system and ventilation equipment.The tunnels are the sixth and seventh found in the area in less than four years. 
Federal prosecutors plan to file charges against Rep. Grimm, attorney says Jan 2, 2013: Representative Michael Grimm (R-NY) talks to the media. (Reuters)New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed late Friday that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the congressman. The decision follows a two-year FBI investigation into various aspects of Grimm's business and campaign history. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"We are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised," said the statement from Grimm's attorney, William McGinley. "From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth." The statement said Grimm  "asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing" and "will be vindicated." "Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent," the statement said.The House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. That committee said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said he could not confirm, deny or comment on the case.Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol.After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, "Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony."Scotto, who was asking about fundraising during Grimm's first campaign, protested, saying he was asking "a valid question."During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman who had been romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.In that case, made public this month, the woman was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to Grimm's campaign by passing them through friends who agreed to have the donations listed under their names.A spokesman in Grimm's Washington office, Nick Iacono, did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment Friday.The Associated Press contributed to this reportDaily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Feds see surge in children crossing US-Mexico border amid concerns over immigration policy In this Dec. 1, 2011 file photo, a Guatemalan boy who was found in the Mexican desert is shown arriving at the international airport in Guatemala City.ReutersThe number of children caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has surged over the last two years, raising questions about whether the Obama administration's changing immigration policies are creating a magnet. Statistics released late last week show 24,668 "unaccompanied alien children" were placed last year in the care of the federal agency that, by law, is responsible for them. That's nearly double the number from 2012, and nearly quadruple the number in years past. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTAs is often the case with immigration statistics, it's unclear what is driving the increase. The surge could be driven in part by better enforcement, and immigration officers doing a better job catching border crossers.But critics point to other factors. A federal judge in Texas claimed earlier this month that the Department of Homeland Security has been delivering children smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border to their illegal immigrant parents. In June 2012, the administration decided to give a reprieve to young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Though the latter would not apply to people who just arrived, critics say these policies send a clear message south of the border: The rewards of trying to cross into the U.S. outweigh the risks. Chris Crane, who heads The National ICE Council immigration officer union, said agents are being "overrun" with children crossing the border. "We can't keep up with it," he said. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, most of the minors come from Central America -- largely Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The stats show a big spike over the past two years. The office recorded an "unprecedented increase" in 2012, with the number jumping from an average of 6,775 to 13,625. The numbers refer to children who are intercepted by the Department of Homeland Security. Under federal law, many of those children are transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, within the Department of Health and Human Services. They are supposed to be entered into immigration proceedings, though Judge Andrew Hanen questioned whether this was necessarily happening, particularly in cases where minors were reunited with their parents. Most of the children are housed through a network of federally funded care centers. But as the traffic increases, those are becoming over-burdened. The situation drew national attention in 2012 when Lackland Air Force Base in Texas was used to house dozens of children. The children can, in some cases, be placed with relatives. But Hanen, in his Dec. 13 order, claimed the practice is going too far. He accused the government of effectively aiding the drug cartels which play a big role in human smuggling rings and claimed the practice is "encouraging" more smuggling. (It's unclear to what extent the ORR statistics count those who are transported to their parents in the U.S.). Some of the children who cross illegally into the U.S. can petition for legal status. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, those seeking asylum or who can demonstrate they were abused or abandoned by their parents in their native country can be eligible. Non-profits sometimes provide legal representation for these individuals. One such group, Kids in Need of Defense, notes that many are escaping "abuse or persecution" in coming to the U.S. While dealing with the influx of children and teens crossing the border, the Obama administration has tried to prioritize deportations for those who have committed crimes while in the U.S. -- while going easy on so-called "DREAM Act"-style cases. Hanen wrote that his court is "not blind to the needs of a minor child," and recognizes the right of prosecutors to use their "discretion" in such cases. However, he wrote, "those who hear that they should not fear prosecution or deportation will not hesitate, and obviously have not hesitated, to [violate immigration law]." Ira Mehlman, spokesman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, called the judge's accusations "fairly astounding." He claimed that "non-enforcement policies" are what's behind the increase in illegal crossings, though noted that the practice of linking up children with relatives in the U.S. has "been going on for awhile."Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
The fix is in: Dems push ObamaCare remedies FILE: March 31, 2014: An ObamaCare enrollment event in Commerce, Calif.REUTERS**Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**Buzz Cut: • The fix is in: Dems push ObamaCare remedies • Jeb tweaks base, says GOP needs ‘bigger vision’ • Bubba leans right, calls for spending control, compromise • Brown to declare candidacy Thursday • The biggest election ever THE FIX IS IN: DEMS PUSH OBAMACARE REMEDIESConservatives are fuming over a House-passed fix that mitigates some of ObamaCare’s damage to small businesses. It’s not just that the change is a reversal of the GOP stance that the law is beyond repair, but also that it was quietly tacked on to an irregular, unannounced March 27 voice vote on the annual delay of Clinton-era Medicare cuts. [Good luck passing the House budget plan now, by the way.] The ObamaCare change, which came at the behest of business groups struggling with ObamaCare implementation, isn’t controversial itself, but Democrats are crowing that they have finally broken the GOP blockade. Embattled Democrats are desperate to show that they are working to repair the struggling law, and say this is the moment they can begin to start shifting the ObamaCare debate. The strategy, outlined for Politico, is to show Democrats at work on pernicious but peripheral problems with the law. The goal is to protect the Democratic majority in the Senate and thereby the law itself.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT[The Hill looks at the move by embattled Democrats like Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., to block ObamaCare hikes to rates for the popular Medicare Advantage program amid further alienation from older voters for their party.]Reid takes a (little) risk - The strategy of seeming to mend ObamaCare from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his team is a perilous one. As angry as conservative Republicans are at the sneaky tactic of tucking the fix into the bill, if it is the start of Reid & Co. allowing ObamaCare legislation through a years-long blockade, GOPers could stand to benefit. Democratic divisions have not much been on display because Reid allows so little activity in the Senate, but they are real and are likely to get worse as the pressure of midterms takes its toll and as the party braces for a return to its ‘90s-era partnership with Wall Street. [Er… - “The Congress of the United States, which wrote [ObamaCare], the members which are proud of what they have done are happy to not run away from what we have done, very proud of what we have accomplished.” – House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in an interview with CNN.]Threading the needle - What Democrats hope to do is restore some measure of trust on the issue of health care lost amid the stumbles of ObamaCare and simultaneously brand Republicans as intransigent and cruel. The conventional wisdom in Washington remains that the GOP shouldn’t risk worsening infighting and opening itself up to counter criticism by settling on a replacement for ObamaCare. But as Democrats start to see the advantages of being seen as fixing the law, Republicans are in dire need of an answer as to what they propose.Pfeiffer pfeels pfine - The Hill: “White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer on Sunday rejected the suggestion that Republicans will take control of the Senate in the midterm elections, saying that the GOP argument to repeal ObamaCare is a ‘political loser.’ ‘I'd say we believe we're going to keep the Senate,’ Pfeiffer said on CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’…”TAKING AIM AT INCOME INEQUALITY… ELSEWHEREToday, President Obama will today sign two executive orders aimed at male-female wage discrepancy (like the one at the White House).

Click here to see the interview.JEB BUSH TWEAKS BASE, SAYS GOP NEEDS ‘BIGGER VISION’ FOR 2016  There certainly no pandering to the GOP base as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sat down with Fox News’ Shannon Bream. Bush pleaded for mercy for illegal immigrants, saying "It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family," to illegally enter the United States. The interview, part of this weekend’s 25th anniversary celebration of his father’s presidential library, Bush also reiterated his support for Common Core federal requirements for public schools, saying it was misunderstood by foes to be a national curriculum. The two-term Florida Republican clearly knew the impolitic nature of his immigration answer, prefacing his comments by saying “I’m going to say this and it will be on tape – so be it.”[Read the NYT take on Bush’s waters-testing weekend: “Offstage, Mr. Bush gave indications of interest throughout the weekend. He approached one guest to ask if he was still working for another Republican known to be positioning for a presidential campaign; told yes, Mr. Bush moved on without further comment.”]If he’s in it, it’s to win it - Bush reaffirmed his time frame for a 2016 decision of later this year, similar to that given by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Discussing his criteria for his decision, Bush asked “Can a candidate run with a hopeful, optimistic message run? Hopefully with enough details to give people a sense …that it's not just idle words and not get thrown, not get back into the vortex of a mud fight?  Can you do it, in my case, can one do it joyfully, without being tied to all the convention of the politics of here and now. And the other is it okay for my family?”  Bush added “it turns out that not running has generated more interest than if I said I was running.” Bush also suggested his blunt talk about conservative sacred cows like immigration was part of a larger vision. “We need to elect candidates that have a vision that is bigger and broader and candidates that are organized around winning the election, not making a point,” Bush told Bream. “Winning allows the big things to get solved. Winning gets the country back on track, in my mind.” More from “America’s News Headquarters.”Paul: ‘adapt or die’ - Sen.

Clinton was stumping for a pair of Arkansas Democrats over the weekend, his former Emergency Management Director James Lee Witt and the former North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hayes, both Democrats trying to crack the GOP’s monopoly on federal offices in the state. Clinton has previously campaigned for embattled Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and the gubernatorial bid of former Rep. Mike Ross, D-Ark.Frozen ‘till Hillary has chosen - WSJ looks out how 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s numerous shadow campaigns are spelling trouble for other prospective Democratic contenders: “When advisers to a fundraising group backing a prospective 2016 Clinton bid came calling in late January, hedge-fund manager and political heavyweight Orin Kramer said he met them in his New York office and agreed to write a check. When another potential candidate, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, tried to reach him, Mr. Kramer said he didn't take the call… That organizational advantage coupled with her renown as a former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state have prevented other prospective Democrats from getting a toehold in the race.

(e.g.: Asked if he wanted to be in Washington when the ObamaCare Web site crashed: “You gotta be kidding. You get a freebie question for the ridiculousness of that question.”) When asked to offer his thoughts on 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton the Chicago mayor said, “…while Bill Clinton was seen as centrist and Hillary less so during the White House years, that is not true. They are clearly different speakers, which is central to leadership. Bill Clinton can go with or without a text. I think Hillary is equally eloquent when she lets go of that text.

Florida lawmakers approve in-state tuition for DREAMers The Florida House of Representatives ratified Friday by a vote of 85-32 a bill making qualified undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state tuition at public universities and community colleges.The Senate approved the measure on Thursday and it is now headed to Gov. Rick Scott, who has promised to sign it as soon as it reaches his desk.The move will benefit students covered by the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, created in 2012 to help the undocumented young people that the long-stalled DREAM Act was intended to benefit."We're very happy and excited that the bill has been approved by the state Senate and confirmed by the House of Representatives," Julio Calderon, a 24-year-old student at Florida International University in Miami, told Efe.The in-state tuition rate is about one-quarter the amount paid by non-Florida residents.Scott and predecessors Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez - all Republicans - applauded Friday the passing of the bill.The law will benefit some 200,000 undocumented students in Florida," Kathy Bird, coordinator of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, told Efe, while expressing her great satisfaction and pride for this legal victory "after a fight that's gone on for more than 10 years."Florida becomes the 21st state to establish some kind of university enrollment benefit for undocumented immigrants, after Virginia did the same earlier this week.The bill offers the advantages of in-state enrollment and tuition for undocumented students who attended high school in Florida for three years prior to graduation.Before receiving these benefits, undocumented students must take an oath to apply for regularization of their immigration status.

Forget Immigration, Congress Looks To Return To Work With Bare Minimum In Mind WASHINGTON (AP) –  Congress gets back to work Monday after a two-week vacation, and it's looking like lawmakers will do what they do best: the bare minimum.Forget immigration, a tax overhaul, stiffer gun checks. They're all DOA.Raising the minimum wage or restoring lost unemployment benefits? Not going to happen. Forcing government approval of the Keystone XL pipeline? Veto bait.The only things likely to become law in a Congress bitterly divided between House Republicans and the Democratic-led Senate are those that simply have to pass, such as a measure to avoid a government shutdown.That's a short, short list.It gets even shorter if you leave off things that can wait until a postelection lame-duck session.Atop the list is a short-term spending bill to keep the government running past the Oct. 1 start of the new budget year. Votes on the bill aren't needed until September.After stumbling into a politically costly partial government shutdown last fall, Republicans won't let it happen again, especially with an election just around the corner. This year's measure should be no problem.Much more difficult, however, is the second main item of must-do business: finding more money for the Highway Trust Fund to keep road and bridge construction projects afloat. The fund is running critically low on cash. The administration says that could mean a slowdown in construction projects this summer and fall when lawmakers are back home asking voters to return them to Washington for another term. The current highway bill expires at the end of September."The number of (must-do) items is small," said GOP lobbyist Hazen Marshall of the Nickles Group. "But the degree of difficulty, particularly for the highway bill, is very high."Top lawmakers and the administration all say they want to pass a multiyear highway and transit funding bill. Most Capitol Hill watchers think a temporary extension of funding is far more likely. That's still complicated.Lawmakers will have to agree on perhaps $10 billion to $15 billion in funding to cover expected trust fund shortfalls. Optimally, Congress would act before its August vacation.Passing those two bills is probably all that has to happen before Election Day. Congress has taken care of must-do legislation to increase the debt limit and fix Medicare's flawed payment formula.So what will Congress do for the next few months? Not much.There will be efforts to get the troubled appropriations process back on track in the aftermath of last year's shutdown and modest follow-up budget bargain.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., a few weeks of floor time after last year's failure to pass a single appropriations bill through the Senate.The House will try to pass as many bills of the 12 spending bills as it can, but measures funding implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency are candidates to bog down.In the Senate, Democrats scrambling to retain control of the chamber will stage votes to raise the minimum wage and help the middle class with rising costs for college and child care. Those are issues designed to appeal to voters in the midterm election.But there also will be a series of Senate debates on lower-profile legislation such as bills by Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. to promote energy efficiency, and legislation by Sens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, to encourage public-private partnerships to boost innovation in manufacturing.Liberals such as Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and tea partyers such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, both want to end lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.In the GOP-controlled House, additional votes to repeal parts of President Barack Obama's health law are assured. Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced Friday that the House will soon pass legislation to boost charter schools.The House has passed legislation aimed at forcing the administration to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline running from Canada to Texas, and bills to ease environmental regulations that GOP lawmakers say destroy jobs. Driving-season legislation aimed at gasoline prices is in the works, and conservative policy provisions are likely to be added onto spending bills.GOP House leaders are in the early stages of developing legislation to replace the health law, but there's no guarantee it ever will be completed or see a vote. The piecemeal approach they've promised to overhauling immigration policy seems to be languishing.Must-do items are few and far between.Legislation to renew tax breaks collectively known as "extenders" qualifies in most people's minds, but can wait until the session after the November elections.The leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees, both of whom are retiring at the end of the term, will make sure to keep intact the five-decade streak of successful enactment of the annual defense policy measure.Another must-do item is renewing a federal program that backstops the market for private terrorism insurance. The program, created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, expires at the end of the year. Its renewal is eagerly sought by the insurance industry and large commercial interests like real estate developers and hotel chains.There doesn't seem to be much controversy in renewing the program, which has been done twice before, but it's still an item that can wait for the lame-duck session.Lastly, there's bipartisan desire in both the House and Senate to wrap up negotiations on a multibillion-dollar measure authorizing water projects such as expanding the Port of Savannah in Georgia, and easing flood risks along the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota. The measure has easily passed both House and Senate.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

Former Vatican Ambassador: ‘Collateral baggage’ impacts US relationship with Pope  President Obama met with Pope Francis at the Vatican Thursday. While both leaders have a lot in common when it comes to issues like the poor, immigration and the environment, the two are divided over abortion, same-sex marriage and the White House’s position on the health care and its mandates for contraception coverage.In an interview with Fox News’ Lauren Green, Francis Rooney, former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, spoke about America’s relationship with the Vatican.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTSince becoming Pope, Francis has become an advocate for economic and social justice.  An area, Rooney believes, Obama can relate.“When the Pope talks about income inequality and crony capitalism he’s coming from a pretty horrendous country [Argentina] for these two areas with no safety net,” Rooney said. “He’s also looking at the whole world with so many tragedies going on effecting people’s human dignity and rights.”One issue of concern Francis sees is the increasing secularism in the West.“He [Francis] has been continuing the line of Benedict [XVI] … as secularism rises in society, the role of religion can be marginalized and confined more and more,” Rooney said.Rooney recalled relationships previous presidents have had with the Vatican. In particular, how President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II both shared antipathy for the former Soviet Union and communism.  “The visits of President Reagan, visits of President Bush, they involved administration policies that were so closely aligned with the Holy See’s diplomacy – you didn’t have some of this collateral baggage we see [now],” Rooney said.  Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
France elections: Ruling socialists headed for drubbing PARIS –  French pollsters said the governing Socialists lost ground to the conservative right in municipal elections Sunday that are seen as a referendum on embattled President Francois Hollande and certain to lead to a government shakeup.Estimates showed the anti-immigration far right adding several towns to its victory bucket after a symbolic win in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont in last week's first round.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe low participation rate, estimated at no more than 62 percent, was expected to break an all-time record."It's a defeat firstly for the left. It's a sad evening," government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said.The only good news for Hollande was solid indications by pollsters that the crown jewel, Paris, would remain in its hands with a win by Anne Hidalgo, 54, for six years deputy of Socialist Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe. She was battling another woman for the French capital, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet from the rival right.The anti-immigration National Front had a surprisingly strong finish in the first round of voting and pollsters said its candidate in the Cote d'Azur town of Frejus was winning. Extreme-right candidate Robert Menard, former head of Reporters Without Borders, supported by the National Front, won the town of Beziers.But the far-right National Front lost bids for several key towns, including Avignon, site of the famed theater festival, taken by the Socialists in a major upset for the conservative right. The far-right also lost Perpignan where the companion of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, Louis Aliot, was running. The National Front also lost in the small southern town of Saint Gilles, where one of its two deputies, Gilbert Collard, was running.Hollande's governing Socialists were victorious in 2008 municipal elections but lost a string of mid-sized cities on Sunday, including the Champagne capital of Reims.The results reflect the president's unpopularity and his failure to cure a lagging economy or fix the unemployment rate hovering around 10 percent."It's an even more severe slap (for the Socialists) than in the first round," said former conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe. "There is a powerful of (government) policies." Juppe retained his role as mayor of Bordeaux with an out-right first-round win.Pollsters estimate that the opposition UMP party can take back control of around 100 city halls.The National Front used the local elections to try to build a grassroots base - with 1,000 municipal officials in place, to position the party for national voting and European parliamentary elections in May.But the table turned in Avignon, where the far-right party came top in first-round voting but lost to the Socialists and its allies — helping the left to win by draining votes from the right, which had run the city in the past.Many in France expect the vote to be followed quickly by a government shake-up in response to the electoral drubbing. Voters nationwide are disillusioned that despite Hollande's 2012 election pledge of "Change, Now," unemployment continues to rise and the economy continues to stagnate."I've heard the warning," Hollande said at his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday after poor first-round results.

France's ruling Socialists face drubbing in municipal polls expected to show far-right gains PARIS –  Voters in Paris and across France are going to the polls Sunday in municipal elections seen as a referendum on embattled President Francois Hollande's first two years in office.The far-right National Front aims to build on its surprisingly strong finish in the first round of voting last week. The anti-immigration party made advances across the country amid record-low voter turnout and is poised to make significant gains in the voting for mayors and municipal counselors in 36,000 villages, cities and towns.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe ruling Socialist party, reeling from Hollande's record-low approval ratings and a string of embarrassing scandals, is bracing for a rout that pollsters estimate could see the opposition UMP party take back control of around 100 city halls.Many in France are expecting the vote to be followed quickly by a government shake-up in response to the electoral drubbing. Voters nationwide are disillusioned that despite Hollande's 2012 election pledge of "Change, Now," unemployment continues to rise and the economy continues to stagnate.One bright spot for Hollande is the capital, where Anne Hidalgo is favorite to defeat rival Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet and keep Paris in Socialist control for another six-year term. Hidalgo, 54, has served for 13 years as deputy to outgoing Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe.Hidalgo benefits from the successful projects carried out by Delanoe, such as the Velib bike-sharing and Autolib auto-sharing services, and the creation of a beachfront each summer on the banks of the Seine.Hidalgo also benefits from Paris' system of indirect voting, in which the mayor is chosen by the 163 members of the City Council. Voters choose council members based on party lists in Paris' 20 districts, and Hidalgo's Socialists are very likely to be ahead in some of the most populated neighborhoods. 
Frustrated Immigration Activists Feel 'Betrayed' By President Obama On Deportations Santas Gutierrez weeps when she speaks about how she feels about President Obama now.In 2008, and again in 2010, her relatives voted for him, clinging to his vow to reform immigration laws.âI feel betrayed,â said Gutierrez, a legal permanent resident who came from Guatemala in 1989, and whose husband has been in immigration detention for five months. âI thought, we all thought, that things would improve for immigrants.âGutierrez was one of dozens of people â relatives of immigrants who are sitting in detention or who have been deported â who staged a hunger strike outside the White House, demanding that Obama curb deportations, which have reached a record rate during his tenure.The hunger strike was one of many demonstrations and press conferences held around the country to vent frustration over Obama and his failure to deliver on his campaign promises regarding a sweeping immigration overhaul.The frustration, which has been mounting since another attempt to pass immigration reform failed in Congress last year, did not ebb on Tuesday â a day after news that U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is considering limiting deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.Among those who may be spared deportation in a change in the process are those who don't have serious criminal records, and others who now are removed each year solely because they committed repeat immigration violations, such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported, failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court date.However, it would fall short of the sweeping changes sought by activists, who have grown increasingly frustrated by what they say is Obama's refusal to use executive powers to change some key aspects of U.S. immigration policy.âMy first thought, when I heard that, was right now there are cases of people in detention, and people who are being deported,â said Tania Unzueta, an organizer for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, in a phone interview with Fox News Latino. âIf theyâre considering change, if that change is going to happen, it needs to happen today, as soon as possible.âUnzueta is a member of a commission that activists who want a comprehensive reform bill formed to come up with recommendations to give to the Obama administration for an overhaul of immigration policies.She was one of about 20 activists who met with Johnson recently to discuss the recommendations.Mondayâs news reports about the DHS headâs plans to review changes to deportation, Unzueta said, left her underwhelmed.âAt this point, itâs hard to get excited about announcements,â Unzueta said. âWeâve been waiting for so long for Congress to act, and the president can use his executive power to do something â right now. Why are we waiting?âObama has blamed Republicans in the House of Representatives for inaction on immigration reform.A bipartisan group in the Senate â four Republicans and four Democrats â last year spearheaded a legislative effort that included provisions for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, tightened border security and expanded worker visas programs.But the measure, which passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate in June, came to a halt in the House, where Republicans hold a majority and where a conservative faction has vowed not to pass any measure that gives breaks to people who have broken immigration laws.But Obama, liberal critics say, has presided over the highest rate of deportations of any president â something, they say, he cannot blame on Congress and its handling of immigration reform proposals.âThe family-separation crisis is a very real and terrifying burden to a generation of parents and children who either live in crippling fear or continue to be tragically torn from one another,â said a statement by the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), the nationâs largest immigrant-rights coalition.âOn one hand, President Obamaâs policies lead to scores of needless deportations and family separations,â said the FIRM statement. âOn the other hand, Republicans seem happy to abdicate their responsibility and take up the family separation mantle as a party platform. Together, theyâve manufactured a painful moral crisis in our communities.âThese advocates, many who supported Obamaâs presidential candidacy, want the president to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups, such as the parents of any children born in the United States.Gutierrez, the Guatemalan woman whose husband sits in deportation, said she holds out hope that Jeh Johnson will implement the changes that reportedly he is considering.Her husband, Gutierrez said, is a farm worker who was arrested in their home state of Massachusetts last year after a routine traffic stop.Police found he was driving without a license, and because of his illegal status, he was detained under the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.Though Gutierrez has her green card, and they have three U.S.-born daughters, her husband has a difficult immigration case.He was deported twice and re-entered, technically a federal crime.âHe has no criminal history,â said Unzueta, who is familiar with the details of the case. âSome people get charged with a felony for re-entry, others donât.âSantas Gutierrez said she hopes the rumored changes under consideration take hold while her husband is still in the United States and could benefit from them.âHeâs worked hard his whole time here,â she said. âHe tends crops â corn, tomatoes â he supports his family. Iâve never been on a government handout. Iâve stayed home and raised our children, and heâs provided.âFor most of his time here, her husband, whom she met in the United States, had a work permit, she said. But it expired, and he did not apply for a green card.âWeâre devastated,â she said. âHeâs sitting in a jail. My daughtersâ grades have suffered. They are depressed and are despondent, they are not motivated to do anything. I cannot sleep, I am on medication for sleep now.ââI wish President Obama would do what he said he would,â she said, weeping. âWe believed him.âThe Associated Press contributed to this story.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
More Than 100 Presumed Undocumented Immigrants Found In Houston House HOUSTON (AP) –  A house overflowing with more than 100 people presumed to be in the United States illegally was uncovered just outside Houston on Wednesday, a police spokesman said.The suspected stash house was found during a search for a 24-year-old woman and her two children, a 7-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, who were reported missing by relatives late Tuesday after a man failed to meet them as planned at an undisclosed location on the city's north side, said John Cannon, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department. Many of the people in the house that authorities said appeared to be part of a human smuggling operation were dressed only in undergarments and they were sitting in in filthy conditions and surrounded by trash bags full of old clothing, Cannon said.When police opened the door to the home they found "a large, large group of people, some sitting on top of one another, very confined spaces," Cannon said. "They yell out the woman's name to see if she is in there, and she emerges with the two children. They're okay."- John Cannon, a spokesman for the Houston Police DepartmentThe single-family home in southern Harris County is about 1,500 square feet, Cannon said. At first, officers saw only a mattress on the floor and a refrigerator in an exterior room. It was when they went further into the house that they found the people — 94 men, all in their undergarments and shoeless, 15 women as well as the woman with her two children — lying in filth in several small rooms. They had access to one bathroom but no hot water.Many of the women said they had been in the house for three or four days, Cannon said. One woman said she had been there for 15 days. All of them said they were hungry, thirsty and tired."It was just filth, very squalid-like conditions inside. Trash bags with clothing piled as high as you can see," Cannon said. "They were very surprised at the numbers of people inside. Some were just sitting on top of one another because there was just no room."Authorities said five men have been arrested.Houston police have handed the investigation over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE spokesman Greg Palmore said it has been five years since officials uncovered a house in the Houston area with a similar number of people inside. In 2012, a house with 86 people was discovered, he said.ICE took the people in the home into custody and they will be questioned and fed, Palmore said. The people were primarily from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, he said. Two of the people, a pregnant woman and a man, have been taken to a hospital for unknown treatment, he added. Although Palmore said it was too early to say whether this was part of a human trafficking operation, he said it appeared that way.Houston sits about seven hours from the Mexican border, making it a popular route for immigrants, Palmore explained."Houston is significant for the highway corridors that make up Houston, I-45 and I-10. With those two traffic corridors you can pan out anywhere in the United States," Palmore said. "And it's very easy to assimilate into the communities here."The home was found after Houston police were tipped off that the woman and children they were looking for may have been taken there. Cannon said police set up surveillance points outside the house early Wednesday and pulled over a car with two men inside for a routine traffic stop when they saw them leaving the driveway. Handguns and documents that suggested illegal activity were found in the car, leading police to detain the two men and enter the house, he said.After the people were removed and a count began, three men attempted to flee on foot, Cannon said. Those men have also been detained and are suspected of illegal activity as well. In addition, police found two coops with hundreds of chickens on the property that are part of an investigation into illegal cock-fighting, he said.Police have not identified the suspects.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Jacques Boissinot)The Associated PressQUEBEC CITY –  Quebec's separatist party faces doubts about its very survival after voters solidly rejected the main purpose of its existence — making the French-speaking province an independent country.Voters ousted the Party Quebecois from power in provincial legislative elections largely centered on the independence debate. The PQ got just 25 percent of the popular vote in Monday's election, its worst showing since it first participated in elections in 1970, shortly after its founding with the explicit goal of breaking away from Canada.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIt was a shocking blow for a party that took power in a minority government just 18 months ago. The Liberals had led the province for nine years, but suffered from corruption allegations.Premier Pauline Marois had called the snap elections in the belief that her pro-independence Parti Quebecois could win a parliamentary majority, buoyed by the popularity of its proposed "charter of values" that would ban public employees from wearing Muslim headscarves and other overt religious symbols.Instead, the Quebec Liberals, staunch supporters of Canadian unity, came away with the majority in Monday's vote, winning 70 seats in the 125-member National Assembly.Chantal Herbert, a columnist for the Toronto Star, called it a "life-threatening defeat" for the Parti Quebecois.With only 30 seats in the legislature, the PQ now faces four years in opposition to ponder its future. Everything from its leftist ideology to its proposed secular charter is up in the air.Francois Legault, a former PQ member who now leads the smaller Coalition for Quebec's Future said the results will force his old party to do what he did five years ago — ponder its fundamental belief in an independent Quebec."I think these people will have to go through the same reflection I did in 2009," said Legault, whose party won 22 seats after pledging to set aside the referendum question to focus on more pressing issues, such as the economy.Quebec's identity has been contentious since the 1760s when the British completed their takeover of what was then called New France. In the 1960s, the Parti Quebecois was formed under the leadership of a TV commentator-turned-politician named Rene Levesque, who would go on to rule the province for nine years.Quebec, which is 80 percent French-speaking, has plenty of autonomy already. The province of 8.1 million sets its own income tax, has its own immigration policy favoring French speakers, and has legislation prioritizing French over English. Twice, voters have rejected sovereignty, though only by a razor-thin margin in a 1995 referendum.In recent years support for independence has fallen, and the PQ has headed a Quebec government for just 18 months out of the past decade.Marois herself tried to downplay the sovereignty issue during the campaign, insisting that her government would only push for a referendum when Quebecers were ready and trying to keep the focus on the charter of values. The strategy floundered after one prominent PQ candidate, media mogul Pierre Karl Peladeau, passionately declared his dream of making Quebec an independent country.At a rally Monday night, Peladeau and other PQ leaders insisted they would not give up that quest."We will never abandon it — never!" Bernard Drainville, a cabinet member in the Marois government, shouted before leading the party faithful in a chant of "We want a country, we want a country!"The PQ's first order of business will be to elect a new leader. Drainville and Peladeau, who won his seat, are among the potential candidates. Marois, who lost her own seat, stepped down as party leader immediately on Monday night.Critics of the sovereignty movement were swift to cast Tuesday's election outcome as essentially another failed referendum on independence."This is the best political news for Canadian federalists in a generation and a crushing blow to a party that has been pushing its secessionist vision for almost half a century and still can't make the sale," the Toronto Star wrote in its editorial Tuesday. "Three times rebuffed, the PQ is dazed and diminished."The election campaign was expected to focus on the proposed secular charter, which has strong support among French-speakers outside Quebec's big cities. But the election outcome suggested even that wasn't a priority for many Quebecers who are more concerned about the economy, health care and education."It's just not something that interests me," said Anne-Sophie Martel, a 21-year-old university student, sitting at a Quebec City coffee shop. "Jobs, the economy — that's really what interests me."Quebec Liberal leader Philippe Couillard, a former provincial health minister and brain surgeon who now becomes premier, attributed the PQ's loss in part to a "tectonic shift" in priorities that he said he noticed while traveling around the province."I really felt during the campaign that the young generation — the youth of Quebec — is not at all attracted by anything that limits us or prevents us from having broader horizons," Couillard said at Quebec City news conference.Antonia Maioni, a political science professor at McGill University, said the separatists cannot be completely counted out, even if Quebecers haves no appetite for another referendum on independence anytime soon. Many nationalist sympathizers simply switched to the Coalition for Quebec's future, she said.Even Couillard conceded the point."There is no such thing as the sovereignty movement being dead," he said. 
GOP Candidates For Governor Make Play For Latino Vote With Early Spanish Campaign Ads The message is a common one for a political campaign – the candidate had picked himself up from the bootstraps, and so he knew the value of being employed.But the message is in Spanish, and the messenger is a Republican – Gov. Rick Scott, of Florida.Scott began the Latino outreach much earlier than usual in such elections, taking the unprecedented step of courting Latinos a whole seven months before the November election.Scott is just one of several Republican gubernatorial candidates focused on Spanish-language advertising, unusually early, in their re-election campaigns.The others are New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, and Illinois’ Bruce Rauner.None of the candidates running against them, the Wall Street Journal said, have started advertising on television.Underlying the assertive effort is the growth of the Latino population.“You can expect to see many of our governors build their coalitions for re-election with multi-language ads and outreach,” said Jon Thompson, a spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, according to the Journal.Abbot began advertising in Spanish in early March – before he won the primary. Rauner took out Spanish-language ads last month and Martinez released her ads last week. Martinez's ad campaign, entitled “Las Empresas Pequeñas” is a biographical spot about how her family started a security guard business – and she said as governor she’d fight for small businesses.“We have to help them. That is something I will never forget,” she says in the ad.Scott, who like some of the other candidates, is drawing from his rags-to-riches experience to personalize his courtship effort, has put $500,000 into his ad campaign. In 2010, Scott started advertising a month before the election. But he still managed to score the Latino vote, the newspaper noted.Although this is not addressed in the ad, Scott supports allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public colleges at the same tuition rates as other residents of the state. It marks a reversal from the 2010 primary, the Journal said, when Scott took a hard line on undocumented immigrants, backing a sweeping crackdown on them.For their part, Democratic candidates are likely to prop up their support for a comprehensive immigration reform law that would include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“Republican Congress’s failure on this bipartisan priority will come back to haunt them this fall,” said Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a written statement, according to the Journal.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
GOP candidates appear to be copying phrases from Sen. Paul's websites April 12, 2014: Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, speaks at a GOP Freedom Summit, in Manchester, N.H.APSeveral Republican candidates for state and federal offices appear to be mimicking -- and in some cases, word-for-word plagiarizing -- sections of Sen. Rand Paul's campaign and official websites. The similarities to passages on the Kentucky Republican senator's sites were first flagged last week by Buzzfeed. A review by FoxNews.com finds that while some candidates are not always doing wholesale copy and paste, the similarities in language are obvious. While one candidate's campaign defended the practice by suggesting he and Paul were "like-minded," others did not offer a clear explanation. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTClick to see the candidates' websites. One of the candidates is North Carolina Senate hopeful Greg Brannon, who like Paul in 2010 is a physician vying for his first seat in public office. The similarities in their bios extend to similarities in their websites. Many of Brannon's “Issues” pages are curiously similar to the pages from Paul’s website from his first Senate campaign.Take, for example, this phrase from the candidates’ pages on the Second Amendment, which both feature them holding a gun: Paul: “Politicians often give lip service to the 2nd Amendment but then go off to Washington and vote to restrict gun ownership.”Brannon: “Too many politicians give public lip service to the Second Amendment but then turn around and vote to restrict gun ownership.”Or their pages on immigration:Paul: “Millions crossing our border without our knowledge constitutes a clear threat to our nation’s security.”Brannon: “Millions crossing our borders without documentation constitutes a clear threat to our nation’s security.”Or on abortion:Paul: “In addition, I believe we may be able to save millions of lives in the near future by allowing states to pass their own anti-abortion laws. If states were able to do so, I sincerely believe many -- including Kentucky -- would do so tomorrow, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.”Brannon: “While we are working on the ultimate goal of ending human abortion, I believe that we may be able to save millions of lives in the near future by allowing states to pass their own anti-abortion laws. If states were able to do so, I sincerely believe many – including North Carolina — would do so tomorrow, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.”When asked for comment, Brannon’s spokesman Reilly O’Neal provided the following statement from Brannon: "My website was created over a year ago, and while I agree with every word I was unaware until now of this problem. We have already fixed the passages."Brannon is not alone. Oklahoma Senate candidate T.W. Shannon, who has received endorsements from Sen. Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin, also has the same phrase on his“Education” page as one on Paul’s current website.Paul’s reads: “More money, more bureaucracy, and more government intervention have eroded educational standards.”Shannon’s reads: “More money, more bureaucracy, and more government intervention have eroded educational standards.”An adviser to Shannon, speaking with FoxNews.com, questioned Buzzfeed's description of these similarities as plagiarism. He said by that standard, critics also must accuse every Democratic lawmaker who repeated President Obama’s “if you like your plan, you can keep it” mantra of plagiarism."In the political world you get a lot of agreement among like-minded people. On many issues T.W. Shannon agrees with Rand Paul," Rick Tyler said.  Shannon is not the only Oklahoman who seems to have taken a page (perhaps literally) out of Paul’s playbook. Steve Kern, a Republican candidate for state Senate District 40, also apparently borrowed a phrase from Paul.Kern’s version reads: “More money, more bureaucracy, and more government intervention are eroding this nation’s educational standards in spite of the false narrative.” Kern's site also uses almost an entire paragraph that is on Paul's site:Paul: “I recognize the great potential of local schools and parents who are allowed the freedom to manage their own children's educational needs, according to the community they live in, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all federal government approach that has been proven to not work for most kids.”Kern: “I recognize the great potential of local schools and parents who are allowed the freedom to manage their own children’s educational needs, according to the community they live in, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all federal government approach.”Paul did not respond to requests for comment from FoxNews.com. The Kentucky Republican has faced his own plagiarism allegations in the past. Last year, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow accused Paul of lifting sentences from the Wikipedia pages of the movies “Gattaca” and “Stand and Deliver” for his speeches.Paul dismissed the allegations with an interview with Fusion, saying he quoted and adequately sourced the movies, not Wikipedia.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
GOP Immigration Supporters See Military Service As Path To Citizenship WASHINGTON (AP) –  Stymied on comprehensive immigration overhaul, House Republicans are pushing a plan to give young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents a path to resident status if they join the U.S. military.Rep. Jeff Denham said Friday he would press for a vote on his legislation, known as the ENLIST Act, either as a free-standing bill or as an addition to the defense authorization measure that the House will consider in May. The Californian from a competitive, increasingly Hispanic district is one of a handful of GOP proponents of reform whose hopes for a vote have been quashed this election year."This is a way to improve our national security," Denham told reporters in arguing for his legislation.Denham immediately faced a concerted effort from conservative opponents to scuttle his move. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., circulated a letter among his colleagues opposing any attempt to add immigration legislation to the defense bill. His intent was to collect as many signatures as possible and deliver the letter to House leadership.House Republicans want to avoid a divisive immigration fight that could anger their core voters, especially with an improving outlook for the November midterms. The GOP hopes to increase its majority in the House and possibly win control of the Senate.Brooks, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, vowed to challenge any move on immigration, either when the committee writes its bill on May 7 or on the House floor."If another member tries to give illegal aliens preferential treatment and put them on equal footing with American citizens for jobs in the military, I will fight it and all hell will break loose," Brooks said in an interview.In a blow to Denham, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee — and fellow Californian — said in a statement that he would not include the immigration legislation in his initial version of the defense bill. Republican Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, who is a co-sponsor of Denham's legislation, said the defense bill should not be the original venue for an immigration debate.McKeon, who has announced plans to retire at the end of his term, would prefer to avoid any controversial issue that could undermine speedy passage of his last defense bill, according to congressional aides. The measure that sets policy for the Pentagon and military traditionally enjoys strong bipartisan support and has cleared Congress every year for the last half century, a rare occurrence in the deeply divided legislature.Denham is not a member of Armed Services, but his is working with Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., who is, and several other Republicans on the issue. Coffman could try to force a committee vote to add the immigration legislation.The latest maneuvering comes as the comprehensive, Senate-passed bill that provides a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and tightens border security remains stalled in the House.Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other GOP leaders unveiled a set of immigration principles in January, but rank-and-file members balked at moving ahead on any legislation in an election year. Boehner attributed the GOP roadblock to a collective distrust of President Barack Obama to enforce any new laws.House Republicans want to avoid a divisive immigration fight that could anger their core voters, especially with an improving outlook for the November midterms. The GOP hopes to increase its majority in the House and possibly win control of the Senate.Denham's bill, which has the support of 42 Republicans and Democrats, would allow immigrants who were brought to this country on or before Dec. 31, 2011, and were younger than 15 years old to become legal, permanent residents through honorable service in the military.Denham argued that opponents who have never served in the armed forces lack an understanding of the contributions of immigrants to the military."I know there are a lot of members that have never worn the cloth of our nation like I have, but you're seeing more and more men and women that are on this floor who have served their country that understand that we have immigrants that have served in our military side by side with us," said Denham, who served in the Air Force.Brooks dismissed that assessment."That's bunk. Next question," he told reporters.Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., an outspoken immigration overhaul supporter, said he was backing Denham's effort even if it would amount to an incomplete victory. He also disputed the idea that the quick action by conservatives in the caucus to shut Denham down showed that no action on immigration is possible."I believe there's still a great deal of support," Gutierrez said. "I say let's have a victory."Gutierrez contended that without action by the House, Obama will act on his own authority by summer to protect more groups of immigrants from deportation.Last month, Obama asked Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review enforcement practices to ease his administration's rate of deportations. Under Obama's leadership, almost 2 million people have been removed from the U.S.The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has circulated a draft memorandum of possible recommendations to Johnson, including a proposal similar to Denham's legislation and an expansion of the step Obama took in June 2012 allowing young people who immigrated illegally into the United States — so-called DREAMers — to remain in the country under certain conditions. They take their name from the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM, Act, which is stymied in Congress and would provide a way for them to permanently remain in the U.S.The caucus said that expansion should apply to the parents of the young people.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
GOP rep: 'Doing nothing' on immigration is the real 'amnesty'  Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart appealed to his colleagues to press forward on an immigration overhaul, saying Monday that "doing nothing is not an alternative" -- and tantamount to "amnesty."Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida, has been an advocate for immigration reform and is hopeful a deal can be reached this year. If Congress does not act, the GOP takes the risk of being blamed for not trying to fix immigration, he said.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTDiaz-Balart said the Hispanic community can relate to GOP’s ideals in several ways but said their lack of support to date for immigration legislation has kept potential supporters away.“On certain issues we [Republicans] can [do] very well whether its individual responsibility, freedom, whether its opportunity, job creation, social mobility … There is, however an 800-pound gorilla in the room and that is immigration reform,” Diaz-Balart told Fox News contributor Mallory Factor on FoxNews.com.He sees both parties failing to fully understand and fix the U.S. immigration system.“There is a consensus in the country that we have an immigration system that doesn’t work, we don’t have a legal system that works. … Then you have 11, 12 who knows millions of people who are here undocumented, unlawful … and doing nothing about that is frankly amnesty,” said Diaz-Balart.Diaz-Balart, who is chair of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, said “we have to make choices here.”He added “that we either try to secure the border, have a legal system that works and deal with the folks that are here in a responsible fashion while adhering to the rule of law … or we do nothing and doing nothing is not an alternative.”Diaz-Balart hinted  “there are a group of us [in Congress] that want to solve it,” but when asked who is in the group, he said: "There I cannot go.”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Grimm And Bear It: N.Y. Representative Arrested For Allegedly Stiffing Undocumented Employees NEW YORK (AP) –  Following a two-year investigation of his campaign financing, U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm was indicted Monday on federal mail, wire and tax fraud charges for engaging in what officials describe as schemes to underreport wages of employees at a restaurant he operated before entering Congress, including some who were in the country illegally, a case he says is trumped up.The Staten Island Republican was arrested Monday morning and pleaded not guilty to a 20-count federal indictment. He was released on $400,000 bail.Grimm is accused of concealing more than $1 million in sales and wages.He said he is the victim of a "political witch hunt." He says investigators couldn't make a campaign finance case against him stick, so they trumped up the fraud accusations."I'm going to fight tooth and nail until I am exonerated," he said.Authorities said that when he was deposed by an attorney representing former employees in a lawsuit, Grimm lied under oath about his allegedly fraudulent business practices.Authorities allege the fraud occurred from 2007 to 2010. Grimm, a former FBI agent who spent a decade working for the bureau before leaving in the mid-2000s to pursue private business interests, was elected in 2010 and took office in 2011."Rep. Grimm billed himself as a patriot and an American hero," said George Venizelos, head of the FBI's New York office. "... But Rep. Grimm was anything but an upstanding citizen. He cheated, evaded and then lied."For two years, investigators had been examining his fundraising in the 2010 race and his involvement in the Manhattan restaurant. A House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations."From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth," Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, said in a statement Friday. "Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing."After the House Ethics Committee announced last fall that Grimm was under investigation, the panel said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.Grimm, 44, made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance while they were on a balcony in the Capitol.After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said: "Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony."During the 2010 race, Grimm acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman named Diana Durand, who had been romantically involved with Grimm, of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.On Friday, Durand was indicted in Brooklyn on those charges. She also was charged with making false statements to the FBI when she said she didn't reimburse straw donors for their contributions to Grimm's campaign.Grimm once was an investor in an Upper East Side health food restaurant that has been accused in a lawsuit of cheating its workers and fined by the state for failing to carry workers' compensation. He has said he sold his interest in 2009.A House member who has been indicted does not lose any rights or privileges under federal law or the chamber's rules, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.Rules used by the two major political parties require indicted committee or subcommittee chairmen, or members of a party's leadership, to temporarily step aside. Grimm is not a chairman or a member of the leadership.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Groups sue feds, claiming retaliation against hunger strikers at Washington detention center SEATTLE –  Two legal groups are suing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it is retaliating against immigrant hunger strikers at a Washington detention center by placing them in solitary confinement — something the agency denies.The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and Columbia Legal Services said Thursday they're asking a federal judge in Tacoma for a temporary restraining order to halt the practice.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe groups say hunger-striking is free speech protected by the First Amendment.Hundreds of detainees participated in a hunger strike about a month ago to protest the conditions at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. Some began a renewed effort March 24, and activists say about 20 people have been placed in solitary confinement.The agency says it separated some detainees from the general population because they were pressuring others into supporting the strike. 
Gutierrez challenges Republicans to act on immigration reform Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) on Wednesday warned his Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives that if they don't hold a vote on immigration reform before the July 4 recess President Barack Obama will take matters into his own hands."There are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare U.S. citizens from losing their wives and their husbands and their children to deportation," Gutierrez said in a speech on the House floor."I talk to Republicans and they know the truth: If Republicans do not work with Democrats and bring an immigration bill to the floor, they are giving up a chance to stand for justice, a sense of peace, and fairness for immigrants until after the 2016 presidential elections," the Illinois lawmaker said."That means Republicans will have to head into the 2016 presidential elections as the party that blocked immigration reform that would finally have brought justice to immigrant communities," he added.Obama "did not run for office so that he could deport 2 million people and put thousands of American children in foster care," Gutierrez said. "Do you think he will sit by and do nothing just because you are doing nothing?"House Republicans are continuing to avoid submitting the text of an immigration reform bill to a vote, despite the fact that the Senate approved bipartisan legislation on the matter last June."You have 34 legislative days left until July 4 and you better make use of them. The American people are waiting," Gutierrez told his GOP colleagues.Many analysts feel that if there is no vote on immigration reform before July, the chances of achieving it will vanish with the gearing up for the mid-term elections in November and the subsequent primaries in advance of the 2016 presidential election.

Hawaii Stowaway Not The First To Survive Flight In Wheel Well The amazing and troublesome journey of a California teenager hidden inside a wheel well on a flight from San Jose to Honolulu seems like a miraculous, once-in-a-lifetime trip.But a number of high-altitude stowaways have fooled both airlines and the odds of survival for decades.Daring high-altitudes (the Hawaiian Airlines flight reached a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet), sub-zero temperatures (the young California boy endured temps of minus 30 degree Fahrenheit), and the huge risk when the wheels are lowered for landing, these stowaways have a very small success rate. Those that do make it to their destination alive have done so with strokes of dumb luck.Worldwide, there have been 105 known people who stowed away since 1947, according to data kept by the Federal Aviation Administration. Counting the California teen, 25 made it alive, for a survival rate of about 1 in 4.But the FAA notes that the rate may be lower because people could have stowed away and fallen out of the wheel well without anyone ever knowing.Some factors that lead to high-altitude stowaway survival are the presence of warm hydraulic lines in the wheel-well and the initially warm tires that provide significant heat. Along with the hydraulic lines, a stable climb enables hypoxia that leads to gradual unconsciousness and as the wheel well environment cools, hypothermia accompanies the deep hypoxia, preserving nervous system viability and leaving the stowaway in basically a state of hibernation.One of the most famous successful stowaway attempts occurred in 1993 when a 13-year old boy hid in the wheel well of a Colombian cargo plane en route to Miami.The stowaway, Guillermo Rosales, was found unconscious when the Arca Airline’s flight landed in South Florida and the flight crew began to inspect the DC-8 aircraft after its three hour, 1,000-mile flight from Bogotá. He was found balled up in the wheel well and covered in frost."He definitely should have died," Richard Ungerer, a mechanic told the New York Times then. "The wheel coming up could have crushed him, there's lack of oxygen at that altitude, and it had to be 20 or 30 degrees below zero."So what kept this pint-sized passenger alive?"The plane apparently has a pressurized wheel well, and that's why he survived," George Waldroup, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the predecessor to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Times. "He's a very lucky young man."Other factors that lead to high-altitude survival are the presence of warm hydraulic lines in the wheel well and the initially warm tires that provide significant heat. Along with the hydraulic lines, a stable climb enables hypoxia that leads to gradual unconsciousness and as the wheel well environment cools, hypothermia accompanies the deep hypoxia, preserving nervous system viability and leaving the stowaway in basically a state of hibernation.Being younger helps the chances of survival, though surgeons have tried to recreate this body state during surgery on older people.Several doctors likened the body's experience in a wheel well on a long flight to what happens when someone falls under the ice of a frozen pond. They may have no pulse when they are pulled out, but could be revived."When it comes to hypothermia, all bets are off," said Dr. Jay Lemery, a professor at the University of Colorado specializing in emergency medicine in the wilderness. A body shut down by extreme cold should be "presumed alive, until they are warm and dead."As the plane descends, the warmer temperatures and increasing atmospheric oxygen pressure slowly reduce hypoxia and hypothermia leaving most stowaways in a semi-conscious state.Rosales’ successful, though unwise, escapade led to about a dozen copycat attempts in 1993 alone – to mixed results – and a slew of other attempts in the following years.A popular departure airport for stowaways is Havana’s José Martí International Airport. Since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, an unknown number of people have attempted to smuggle themselves off the island nation in the wheel well of an airplane.In 1969, 17-year-old Armando Socarras Ramírez snuck into the wheel well of an Iberia Airlines flight from Havana to Madrid, avoided being crushed by the rising wheels and survived the cross-Atlantic flight to Spain. His friend, Jorge Pérez Blanco, who snuck into the other wheel well, is believed to have either fell to his death or been blown back on the runway by a jet blast and still be in Cuba.“Doctors said later that my condition was comparable to that of a patient undergoing 'deep-freeze' surgery, a delicate process performed only under carefully controlled conditions,” Socarras Ramírez wrote, according to Altitude.org. “[Doctors] called my survival a 'medical miracle,' and, in truth, I feel lucky to be alive.”The Associated Press contributed to this report. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Hillary Clinton calls for tighter sanctions on Russia STORRS, Conn. –  Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she believes the outcome of the standoff in Ukraine will be a bad one for Russia.Speaking at a University of Connecticut issues forum, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state said she believes the sanctions against the Russian government must be "tightened and widened" to prevent the crisis from escalating.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"I think Russia will pay a big price for this," Clinton said. "But that is an endpoint that we've got to get to as peacefully as possible without seeing the total disintegration of Ukraine as a country with territorial integrity and opportunity to have the relationship it wants with the West."Clinton, who is considering a run for president in 2016, said she believes Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to see a return of a Russian era that no longer exists and said the U.S. and Europe need to be "very clear, strong and to some extent patient" to make that outcome unaffordable to him."I think the outcome for him and Russia will not be good, which is deeply unfortunate," she said. "Russia should be a much more dynamic and much more successful country and could be if Putin weren't trying to turn the clock back to the Soviet Union days."Clinton spoke for more than an hour to a group of about 2,300 students, faculty and staff. The talk was not open to the general public.She used her prepared remarks to praise young people's activism and community service, and called on UConn students be part of what she called the "participation generation."She was then asked questions submitted in advance and spoke on issues ranging from congressional gridlock to immigration reform.She urged the students not to vote for any leader who does not believe in compromise. But she did not say whether she would be a candidate for president.Clinton also had little to say about her political future earlier in the day at a women's leadership conference in Boston. But she offered a strong message to a largely female audience estimated at 3,500."There are times in all of our lives when we're either given an opportunity or we see one that we could seize. And we get nervous. We worry. We're not ready to dare anything. But I hope you will," she said at the Simmons Leadership Conference set along the Boston waterfront. "Women have to dare to compete."It's a familiar refrain from Clinton, who has focused on gender equality, among other issues, in a series of public appearances since leaving the Obama administration last year.In a speech and subsequent question-and-answer session, Clinton thanked the thousands of runners who competed in the Boston Marathon earlier in the week for sending "a message of hope, resilience and determination one year after the vicious attack." Three people died and hundreds were injured in twin bombings near the finish line of last year's marathon.Clinton also drew on her experience as secretary of state, listing her biggest regret as the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. She called it "a terrible, senseless, terrorist action."Clinton's proximity to New Hampshire, which traditionally hosts the country's first presidential primaries, was as noteworthy as her remarks.While potential Republican presidential candidates have begun aggressively courting New Hampshire voters in recent weeks, Clinton has avoided the state altogether since the 2012 elections. Despite her absence, the vast majority of New Hampshire's top Democrats have lined up behind Clinton, the overwhelming Democratic front-runner should she run.She has said she will make a decision about the 2016 presidential contest by the end of the year.Massachusetts doesn't have the same political significance as New Hampshire, but Massachusetts activists make up a significant portion of the volunteer armies needed for get-out-the-vote efforts when the New Hampshire primary season begins in earnest.Wednesday's event also earned widespread media coverage across New Hampshire's most populated areas, which get their television news from Boston stations.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Hispanic delegation that visited pope feels trip was a success The delegation of Hispanic Catholics who traveled to The Vatican to ask Pope Francis to help them put an end to deportations called their visit a success."We're very happy, we think we achieved our objective of issuing a call of hope to maintain the morale of almost 12 million undocumented people in our country," Rev. Marco A. Mercado told Efe upon his return from Rome.The rector of the Our Lady of Guadalupe shrine in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines noted that President Barack Obama said the immigration issue was discussed during the U.S. leader's private audience with the pontiff last week.During their visit to The Vatican a day before Obama's arrival, the 13 members of the Chicago Archdiocese committee delivered to the pope's secretary a petition asking Francis to discuss deportations with the president."The prayers and blessings of the pope come to all the families who are living in anguish and who are suffering the ravages of deportations," Mercado said.One of the delegation members was Jersey Vargas, a 10-year-old girl, who asked the pope to intercede with Obama on behalf of her father, who was on the verge of being deported after being arrested for driving without a license, and the pontiff promised to speak with the president about the matter.A few hours later, Jersey was informed that her father had been released after her family posted a $5,000 bond, and upon her return to Los Angeles, the little girl had an emotional reunion with her dad."As a priest, I feel very happy to see how our universal shepherd walks along with his people, especially with the most needy. We're very confident that President Obama heard the voice of the pope and will put a stop to the deportations," Mercado said.Another member of the delegation was Mexican film star Salomon Carmona, who, upon his return to Chicago, told Efe that the mission the members of the group had set for themselves had been completed.

Holder cancels graduation speech amid protests Attorney General Eric Holder canceled a speech to a graduating class of police cadets in Oklahoma City on Thursday, after crowds of Oklahomans flocked to the ceremony to protest his appearance. Protest organizers said Holder's planned speech to the law enforcement graduates was "inappropriate," and argued that the attorney general has failed to uphold the law himself. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"A lot of people just felt that it was very inappropriate for this man, with his track record, to speak to law enforcement officers that demand and expect to be backed up by the government working on behalf of the citizens, not against the citizens," State Rep. Mike Turner (R.), who is running for U.S. congress, told theWashington Free Beacon. Turner said Holder has flouted the law when it comes to illegal immigration, the "Fast and Furious" gunrunning scandal, and the Second Amendment. The U.S. House of Representatives held Holder in contempt of Congress in 2012, on the grounds that he was impeding investigations into Fast and Furious. The Oklahoma City protest made national news Thursday afternoon, after Holder backed out of the speech shortly before the graduation ceremony began. Holder's office told the Washington Times that the last-minute cancelation was due to a scheduling issue. "The attorney general had been looking to addressing the cadets, and regrets he cannot attend in person," spokesman Brian Fallon told the Washington Times. "He extends his heartfelt congratulations to the cadets and their families." Click for more from The Washington Free Beacon.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Hold the stinkburger: Hillary denounces 'pure partisanship' April 3, 2014: Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks as she delivers the keynote address at the launch of the U.S. Global Development Lab, an initiative of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in New York.AP**Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

At the Women in the World summit in the New York honing her pitch to be the nation’s first female president, Clinton lamented “pure ideology, pure partisanship” in American politics today and warned that “we cannot afford to have people who deny the right and the need for compromise.” It’s a good pitch for Clinton who needs to soften her political image and develop a rationale beyond her gender and 90s nostalgia for voters to grant a third Clinton term in the White House. But it’s not very good for President Obama who, halfway across the country, was escalating his partisan attacks to a new, weird level.[Dems join GOP for ObamaCare changes - Eighteen Democrats joined with House Republicans in voting to scrap ObamaCare’s 30 hour-a-week definition of full time work. More.]This stinkburger tastes gamy - While Clinton was oozing bipartisanship in New York, Obama went to the University of Michigan this week to attack Republican (but not Democratic) opponents of his call to increase the federal minimum wage by 40 percent. How about Republican counterproposals like the fiscal plan on offer from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan? If it was a sandwich at a local delicatessen, Obama said, Ryan’s plan would have to be called “the stinkburger” or the “Meanwich.” Keeping with the attack mode of taunting GOPers as he did in his remarks Tuesday celebrating the end (kind of) of the open enrollment period for his health-insurance entitlement program, Obama was revving up the base with just the kind of “pure partisanship” decried by Obama’s 2008 rival and prospective successor. This dichotomy is likely to only get worse as Democrats face a difficult choice in a difficult election year: embrace the base with Obama-style attacks or run to the middle, a la Clinton.

The 42nd president will campaign for his former head of Emergency Management., James Lee Witt who is seeking Rep. Tom Cotton’s, R-Ark., House seat as Cotton takes on Pryor. Clinton heads to Little Rock on Sunday to campaign for Democratic Mayor Pat Hays.

Maryland this week voted to scrap its exchange and build a new one at an expected cost of $40 million to $50 million.

The exchange also is struggling to process a backlog of 11,000 applicants who didn't get coverage by the March 31 enrollment deadline.”Insurance lockout - AP: “Many people who didn't sign up during the government's open enrollment period that ended Monday will soon find it difficult or impossible to get insured this year, even if they go directly to a private company and money is no object. For some it's already too late. With limited exceptions, insurers are refusing to sell to individuals after the enrollment period for HealthCare.gov and the state marketplaces. They will lock out the young and healthy as well as the sick or injured.”Deadline redux - Fox News: “The White House announced Thursday that April 15 will be the new deadline to sign up for ObamaCare.

It was not always so. This summer will mark the 50th anniversary of the New York World’s Fair, which sprang from and helped shape a Midcentury culture not only obsessed with futurism but imbued with the belief that the toil and strife that had marked every chapter of human history could be swept away by ever more prosperity and technology. Americans of the era seem largely to have believed that the future would be like their present, in which Postwar affluence, common purpose and the wonders of science would produce the culture of which Progressives had long dreamed. Until James Rosen no doubt one day writes an even better book on the topic, we will have “Tomorrow-Land” from Joseph Tirella, a historian whose native Queens played host to the fair. Lauren Zelt reviews Tirella’s work for The Weekly Standard, harkening to a time when 51 million people in a nation of 190 million would come to marvel at the mirage of a future that seemed so real.Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Homeland Security arrests over 600 gang suspects More than 600 suspected gang members have been arrested in the Homeland Security Department's latest crackdown on street gangs, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Thursday. ICE agents, along with local authorities in 179 cities, arrested 638 suspected gang members over a monthlong period in March and April. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTICE officials said 78 suspected gang members were arrested on federal charges while another 447 currently face only state charges. ICE arrested 113 others on administrative immigration charges. More than 400 of those arrested had violent criminal histories, including seven people wanted on murder charges. ICE did not identify all those arrested or the specific charges they face. The latest crackdown, dubbed "Project Southbound", is part of a larger ICE initiative that started in 2005 to target street gangs with international ties. Since the effort started, ICE says it has arrest more than 33,000 suspected gang members. Nearly three-quarters of the suspected gang members arrested in the latest operation belonged to the Surenos, or Sur 13, street gang, according to ICE. Sur 13 originated in Southern California and has members across the country. Its members and affiliates pay tribute to the Mexican Mafia gang. In its 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, the Justice Department said Sur 13 is expanding faster than any other national gang. The government said Sur 13 members are responsible for crimes including murder, extortion and drug trafficking. The crackdown also netted several members of the ultraviolent Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang known for using machetes to hack and stab victims. According to a 12-count racketeering indictment unsealed in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, in March, nine of the gang's members are accused of crimes including murder, extorting high school students and running brothels, witness tampering and obstructing justice. Last year the Obama administration levied financial sanctions against six leaders of the gang, which the U.S. government previously designated as an international criminal group. MS-13 was founded more than two decades ago by immigrants fleeing El Salvador's civil war. Its founders built a reputation as one of the most ruthless and sophisticated street gangs, as they took lessons from the brutal war to the streets of Los Angeles. MS-13 also has a strong presence in Southern California, Washington and northern Virginia, all areas with substantial Salvadoran populations, and as many 10,000 members in 46 states. The gang is also allied with several of Mexico's warring drug cartels.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Homeland Security Secretary Says Immigration Enforcement Changes Will Be Announced 'Pretty Soon' U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson gave a glimpse of potential changes to the Obama administrationâs controversial deportation approach, saying that keeping families together in the United States is critical.Appearing on ABC News Sunday, Johnson said an administration announcement on changes in immigration enforcement would be made âpretty soon.âHe said that immigration enforcement would need to adhere to âAmerican values,â and noted: âOne of those American values is respect for human dignity â¦ [and] one of those American values is respect for the sanctity of the family unit.âRecently, the Associated Press quoted unnamed sources as saying that Johnson was reviewing the way that the United States undertakes deportations, and that he was considering not deporting people who were not a threat to public safety or national security.Frustration among people who want more lenient immigration policies increasingly has shifted toward President Obama, during whose tenure deportations have reached a record 2 million.That is more than the number of people who have been deported under any other president.Johnson, who was sworn in as the fourth Homeland Security secretary late last year, made the promise in a closed-door meeting with Latino members of Congress who've been pressuring the administration to scale back the deportations.Activists contend many people deported pose no threat, and that families are being ripped apart because of the broken immigration system. They are demanding an end to deportations of people who have civil violations, as opposed to serious criminal ones, and also want a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria.But those who favor stricter immigration enforcement say that the United States should not give breaks to people who are here illegally because it would be rewarding those who flouted U.S. laws. A bipartisan comprehensive immigration law passed in the Senate in June, but the effort stalled in the House, where many Republicans â who hold a majority in that chamber â said they would not rubber-stamp the measure because it includes giving amnesty to undocumented immigrants.âWeâre still in the midst of the review,â of the possible changes to immigration enforcement, Johnson told ABC. âAnd Iâm consulting a wide network of people. But I expect to have something pretty soon.âJohnson said he is making sure to run ideas for changes by officials of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE âin a way that Iâm not sure theyâve been consulted in the past.ââIâve consulted ICE leadership on what our priorities should be, how we could realign them, potentially,â Johnson said. âI am looking for ways to more effectively enforce and administer our immigration laws. I believe there is room for improvement, and hopefully weâll get to a better place.âMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who met in recent weeks with Obama to demand an end to the deportation of undocumented immigrants who did not pose a threat to public safety, submitted recommendations to Johnson regarding overhauling the removal process.With comprehensive immigration legislation stalled in the House, Obama announced last month that Johnson would be conducting a review to see if deportation practices can be more humane.A New York Times story noted that since the beginning of Obamaâs tenure, in 2008, two-thirds of the nearly 2 million people who have been deported had no criminal record or had committed minor offenses, such as traffic violations.One out of five, or about 394,000, had committed serious crimes, the Times found.âI have to be honest, I donât understand those who say we are not enforcing the law,â Johnson told âThis Week.â âWe are enforcing the law every dayâ¦ There are thousands of people who are convicted criminals and others who are removed from this country [each day].âActivists contend many people deported pose no threat.Republican senators, meanwhile, are closely watching developments in the deportation review.More than 20 senators have sent President Obama a letter warning âchanges under consideration would represent a near complete abandonment of basic immigration enforcement.ââAs a result of your policies, individuals here illegally who do not meet administration âprioritiesâ are not only largely exempt from the law, but are released even if they come into contact with federal law enforcement authorities,â the letter said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Homeland Security Chief Vows To Review Ways To Make Deportations More Humane As frustration over the United States’ broken immigration system has focused increasingly on President Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday that he will make sure that deportation efforts are aimed chiefly at those who pose a danger to public safety and national security.Johnson, who was sworn in as the fourth Homeland Security secretary late last year, made the promise in a closed-door meeting with Latino members of Congress who've been pressuring the administration to scale back the roughly 2 million deportations – a record – since Obama took office.Activists contend many people deported pose no threat.Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who met in recent weeks with Obama to demand an end to the deportation of undocumented immigrants who did not pose a threat to public safety, submitted recommendations to Johnson regarding overhauling the removal process.The recommendations, according to Politico, included suspending the deportation of people who would be eligible for a path to legalization under a bipartisan Senate bill that passed in June. That part of the bill called for allowing undocumented immigrants to legalize as long as they meet a strict set of criteria, including not having a criminal record, and paying taxes and fines. The immigration overhaul effort has stalled, however, in the House, where many Republicans say they will not support a measure that gives a break to undocumented immigrants. That, they say, would be tantamount to rewarding lawbreakers.Politico reported that about 8 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented people in the country could qualify for a path to legalization under the Senate criteria.“I think it is fair to say that I have learned a lot from the submissions that they have made,” Johnson told reporters following the meeting with the members of Congress, according to Politico. “I appreciate their leadership in the area of immigration reform. I have an open mind about a lot of this.”With comprehensive immigration legislation stalled in the House, Obama announced last month that Johnson would be conducting a review to see if deportation practices can be more humane.A New York Times story in recent days noted that since the beginning of Obama’s tenure, in 2008, two-thirds of the nearly 2 million people who have been deported had no criminal record or had committed minor offenses, such as traffic violations.One out of five, or about 394,000, had committed serious crimes, the Times found.Shortly after assuming his post, Johnson said that an earned path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally is a matter of national security.He said that offering a path to citizenship would encourage such immigrants "to come out of the shadow, to be accountable, to participate in the American experience."Obama and congressional Democrats have long pushed for a sweeping immigration bill that would, among other things, create a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally who don't pose a threat to national security or public safety. Last month, Janet Murguia, head of the National Council of La Raza, or NCLR, said in a way more pointed than the group ever has regarding the president that he is responsible for separation of many families and that he has become the “Deporter-in-Chief.”Her assertion – that while Congress has failed to act to reform immigration, the President has many tools at his disposal to address certain problems undocumented immigrants face – is one that lenient-immigration-policy advocates have made since at least two years after he moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Last year, the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed in the Democratic-controlled Senate also included a provision to nearly double the size of the Border Patrol.Some Republicans have objected to allowing immigrants to gain citizenship before the border is secured. On Wednesday, Johnson said his review of the Obama administration’s deportation process would be completed soon, but did not get more specific.“I am dedicated and committed to ensuring that our removal priorities are focused on threats to national security, public safety and border security,” Johnson said, according to Politico. “I have heard a number of cases that lead me to want to reevaluate our priorities to make sure we’re getting this right, and that’s what I’m doing right now.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Honduras detains 9 undocumented Cuban migrants en route to U.S. Security forces in western Honduras on Thursday detained nine Cuban migrants as they were trying to travel without the proper documents from the Central American nation to the United States, a government official said.The migrants - eight men and one woman - were initially held at the customs office in Agua Caliente, on the border with Guatemala, due to irregularities in their documentation and immigration status, a spokesman for the National Police told reporters.The spokesman added that the Cubans were later turned over to Honduran immigration authorities in the western province of Ocotepeque so that their immigration status could be determined and a decision could be made on whether or not to allow them to continue their journey to the United States.In recent years, Honduras has become a transit zone for illegal migrants, especially Cubans, who flee their country in an attempt to make it to the United States, local authorities say.

House conservatives vow no action on immigration this year  Conservative Republicans on Wednesday ruled out any immigration legislation in the House this year, insisting that the GOP should wait until next year when the party might also control the Senate.House GOP leaders unveiled their broad immigration principles last week that gave hope to advocates and the Obama administration that the first changes in the nation's laws in three decades might happen in the coming months.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTImmigration legislation is one of the top priorities for Obama's second term.But several of the conservatives were adamant that the House should do nothing on the issue this year, a midterm election year when the GOP is angling to gain six seats in the Senate and seize majority control. Democrats currently have a 55-45 advantage but are defending more seats, including ones in Republican-leaning states."I think it's a mistake for us to have an internal battle in the Republican Party this year about immigration reform," Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told reporters at a gathering of conservatives. "I think when we take back the Senate in 2014 one of the first things we should do next year after we do certain economic issues, I think we should address the immigration issue."Labrador's comments were noteworthy as he was one of eight House members working on bipartisan immigration legislation last year. He later abandoned the negotiations."This is not an issue that's ready for prime time to move legislatively," said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who said Republicans should use the principles to begin a dialogue with Hispanics.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the House should focus on the four bills dealing with security that the Judiciary Committee approved last summer. Absent any action on those bills, Jordan said it would be tough to do any immigration legislation this year.The definitive statements from the conservatives came as Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, told a House panel that the comprehensive, Senate-passed immigration bill would have a positive impact on the nation's finances.The Senate last June passed a bipartisan bill that would tighten border security, provide enforcement measures and offer a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally.The measure has stalled in the House where Speaker John Boehner and other leaders have rejected a comprehensive approach in favor of a bill-by-bill process.Elmendorf told the House Budget Committee that a CBO analysis "found that that legislation would reduce budget deficits and lead to a larger economy and over time lead to higher output per person in this country."Specifically, he said additional workers, especially high-skilled, highly educated employees, would increase the nation's tax revenues.The House leaders' broad principles would tighten border and interior security, establish a verification system for employers and legalize some of the 11 million immigrants. It would not provide a special path to citizenship to those living here illegally, though it would give children brought to the country by their parents a shot a citizenship.Conservatives have said they distrust Obama to enforce any new law, citing his waivers and suspensions of provisions on the health care law.Boehner said Tuesday that Republicans were discussing "whether we should proceed, if we proceed and how we would proceed. It's also clear from our members that we believe that securing our borders has to be the first step in this process."But he added that conversations are continuing and "no decision's been made."Further tamping down any optimism for legislation this year was Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who told reporters that differences between the Senate's comprehensive approach and the House's piecemeal strategy were an "irresolvable conflict.""I don't see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place," McConnell told reporters.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
House Democrats To Rely On Infrequently Used, Rarely Successful Tactic To Push Immigration, Minimum Wage WASHINGTON (AP) –  House Democrats are determined to cast an election-year spotlight on Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage and overhauling immigration laws.To try to accomplish that in the GOP-controlled House, Democrats are planning to rely on an infrequently used, rarely successful tactic known as a "discharge petition."It requires the minority party — in this case, Democrats, who are unable to dictate the House agenda — to persuade some two dozen Republicans to defy their leadership, join Democrats and force a vote on setting the federal minimum wage at $10.10 an hour.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats will push the wage issue when Congress returns from its break Feb. 24. Forcing a vote on a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws could occur in a few months.Democratic leaders argue that a majority of Americans favor both steps, which are priorities for President Barack Obama, and say the House GOP is the obstacle. Republicans say Democrats are embarking on an approach that they know has little chance of success in an attempt to circumvent the will of the GOP-led House.The odds are daunting for Democrats in what clearly is political maneuvering ahead of the elections this fall.Some questions and answers on how it works.___Q: What does a discharge petition do?A: It allows the minority or opposition party to bypass the House speaker and get a vote.First, 217 members — one more than half the House's current membership of 432 — have to sign a petition. A motion to consider the wage issue would then be placed on the legislative calendar, but it can't be acted on for at least seven days. Any lawmaker can then call it up but only on the second or fourth Monday of the month. The motion is debated and if the House passes it, then lawmakers would consider and vote on the bill.Currently there are 232 Republicans, 200 Democrats and three vacancies in the House. All 200 Democrats would have to sign the petition, but Democrats would have a tough time getting 17 Republicans to join them.Signing a discharge petition would be a breach of loyalty for Republicans, certain to draw the wrath of the caucus, and a rebuke of Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.Republicans largely oppose any increase in the minimum wage. They say it's an issue left to the states and that it could slow hiring in a struggling economy.Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, acknowledged that Democrats are unlikely to sway Republicans. Yet he also provided a preview of one of his party's arguments on this issue."I don't think we're ever confident that we're going to get 18 Republicans to sign a discharge petition, but we apparently have 30 or 40 that are known over here," Hoyer said at a news conference this past week at the party's retreat in Cambridge, Md. "Our expectation is if they want to make sure that working people have an incentive to work, they will pay them to do so a wage that does not leave them in poverty."___Q: What about immigration? A number of House Republicans back a comprehensive approach. Would they sign a discharge petition?A: Highly unlikely. Republicans still are unwilling to break ranks with the party and Boehner, despite the distinctly different political forces on the issue.Immigration overhaul has the support of an unusual coalition that includes some traditional backers of the GOP. They include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and business groups, religious organizations such as the U.S. Catholic Bishops, evangelicals and labor unions.A few Republicans have expressed support for a comprehensive bill similar to the Senate-passed measure and have pleaded for the House to act this year. They worry about the political implications in their swing districts back home. Yet it would be a remarkable step for some of the more moderate lawmakers from California and Florida to abandon Boehner.Boehner has come out with principles on immigration that call for legal status for some of the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and has expressed support for a piecemeal approach to the issue. Last week, however, the speaker all but ruled out the House acting on legislation this year, blaming GOP distrust of Obama to enforce any new law.On the notion of a discharge petition, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said, "This scheme has zero chance of success. A clear majority in the House understands that the massive Senate-passed bill is deeply flawed."Sen. Chuck Schumer, a major player on the bipartisan Senate measure, recently pushed the idea of a discharge petition, but the New York Democrat is unlikely to sway the nearly two dozen House Republicans necessary to sign on.Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., made clear how Democrats will frame the issue for the Republicans who want immigration overhaul."Talk is one thing; actually doing something is another. And I'm sure they'll have a chance between now and November to let their constituents know whether they're serious on immigration reform, the comprehensive one, or not," Van Hollen said.___Q: A discharge petition sounds like a tough sell. Has it worked recently?The discharge petition worked in 1986, forcing a vote on a gun rights bill, and in 2002, ensuring a vote on campaign finance legislation.The difficulty for a discharge petition in the current political climate was never more evident than last fall in the midst of the 16-day partial government shutdown. Even though several Republicans said they wanted to vote on a spending bill with no strings attached, they rejected the idea that they would join forces with the Democrats.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
House Democrats unveil budget plan with tax hikes WASHINGTON –  House Democrats unveiled their response to Paul Ryan's GOP budget on Monday, and it relies on a $1.5 trillion in higher taxes over the coming 10 years and the economic benefits of immigration reform to make the numbers work.The plan by Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen counts on hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenues from an influx of immigrant workers to help reduce deficits to the $600 billion range by 2024. The measure also embraces President Obama's call for additional infrastructure spending, early childhood education, and additional jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"Where Republicans in Congress gut funding that would boost the economy and help our nation succeed in the 21st century economy, we invest in our kids' education, infrastructure, and life-saving research," said Van Hollen.Ryan's plan manages to eke out a balanced budget by 2024 by repealing the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions and cutting spending across a wide swath of the federal budget. Both plans face votes this week, with the Wisconsin Republican's budget on track to pass.This spring's election-year budget debate, however, has more to do with appealing to the political bases voters of the respective sides than a genuine attempt to find compromise solutions to the government's fiscal problems. Instead, a deal between Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash., has already set the parameters for the upcoming round of 2015 appropriations bills. It was enacted in December.Van Hollen's plan leaves in place so-called ObamaCare and leaves the current Medicare system in place, whereas Ryan would repeal the law's benefits and set in motion a dramatic overhaul of Medicare for future retirees who are presently 55 or younger. It calls for extending refundable tax breaks for the working poor and providing them to childless workers as Obama calls for.The Democratic blueprint promises a deficit of $637 billion in 2024, or 2.3 percent of the size of the economy. That provides for relative stability in the national debt as measure against gross domestic product. Under the current path, the Congressional Budget Office sees a deficit of $1.1 trillion in 2024. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
House Dems attempt to force vote on bipartisan immigration reform bill Mar. 26, 2014: Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., center, surrounded by fellow House Democrats and immigration leaders, speaks on the steps of the Capitol in Washington.APWASHINGTON –  House Democrats deployed a little-used legislative move Wednesday to force a vote on a comprehensive immigration bill, an effort doomed to fail but designed to increase the election-year pressure on Republicans to act."It is time for us to have a vote," said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., who joined with more than a dozen Democrats, advocates and actress America Ferrera to mark 273 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan bill. They insisted that House Republican leaders act.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTStanding on the east steps of the Capitol in a light snow and biting wind, proponents argued that they had the necessary votes in the House for a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and tighten border security."We're tired of the House of Representatives leaders and their refusal to act," Ferrera said.Democrats introduced a discharge petition that requires the signature of 218 for legislative action, an effort that stands little chance of success as Republicans, even those supportive of immigration legislation, are unwilling to defy their leadership. Democrats hold 199 seats in the House and would need dozens of GOP supporters.The GOP is reluctant to vote on the divisive issue in an election year, especially with all signs pointing to major gains for Republicans in the November midterms.After months of conciliatory talk, President Barack Obama issued a statement praising the Democratic effort and chastising the Republicans."Immigration reform is the right thing to do for our economy, our security and our future," Obama said. "A vast majority of the American people agree. The only thing standing in the way is the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress to catch up with the rest of the country."The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June, but the measure has stalled in the GOP-controlled House where Republicans have argued for a piecemeal approach to reforming the system. That effort has gone nowhere as bills approved by the Judiciary Committee last summer have languished.Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other GOP leaders unveiled a set of immigration principles in January, but rank-and-file members balked at moving ahead on any legislation. Boehner attributed the GOP roadblock to a collective distrust of Obama to enforce any new laws.Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, dismissed the Democratic procedural move, pointing to Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's admission earlier this month that they wouldn't get the necessary 218 votes.The reluctance among Republicans comes despite business groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, unions, religious leaders and other activists banding together to push for immigration legislation. National Republicans also have argued that failure to act this year could cost the GOP politically in presidential elections.Opposition remains strong among some in the GOP who see the legislation as amnesty and detrimental to U.S. workers."Incredibly, House Democrats have unified behind an immigration bill that would double the inflow of new guest workers competing against jobless Americans in every single U.S. occupation - from engineering to teaching to manufacturing," said Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Budget Committee.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
House Ethics Committee Launches Investigation Into Congressman Luis Gutierrez Actions by Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois are being scrutinized by the House Ethics Committee.Gutierrez, 60, is in his 11th term representing Chicago and surrounding areas and is a leading advocate of overhauling immigration laws.The ethics panel did not reveal the nature of the inquiry, but a spokesman for Gutierrez said Thursday that it relates to a long-standing service contract made by Gutierrez over the past decade.Spokesman Douglas Rivlin said the contract was reviewed and approved by the House Administration Committee and was submitted for renewal every other year for 10 years. Gutierrez canceled the contract last year.USA Today reported last year that Gutierrez had hired Chicago lobbyist Doug Scofield â the congressman's former chief of staff â to work side-by-side with his congressional staff, starting in 2003. Gutierrez paid Scofield more than $500,000 over 10 years to train staff, review and draft news releases, and help publicize GutiÃ©rrez's activities, the newspaper reported.Scofield also continued to represent clients in his Chicago-area lobbying and public affairs practice.Rivlin, the congressman's spokesman, said the contract with Scofield "was consistently and properly reported" to House officials, adding that Gutierrez has cooperated with the outside organization, the Office of Congressional Ethics, that referred the case to the House ethics panel.The Ethics Committee chairman, Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, and its ranking Democrat, Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, said in a statement that they have received a referral from the OCE about Gutierrez. Conaway and Sanchez say they will announce any further action by May 5.A person familiar with the case, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is ongoing, said the ethics panel will examine whether Scofield's contract with Gutierrez constituted a contractor relationship or a consulting relationship. Contractors are allowed under House rules, but consultants are not.A handbook for members of Congress says members may contract with firms or individuals only for general â nonlegislative and nonfinancial â office services, and only for a specific period not to exceed the member's current term. Contractors are not considered House employees and are not eligible for government-provided personnel benefits.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
House GOP group rejects Obama's call for comprehensive immigration reform FILE: June 15, 2012: Niouseline St. Jean, from Turks and Caicos Islands who lives in the U.S. illegally reacts to a new immigration ruling for students.APA group of House Republicans is rejecting President Obama’s call for members to pass comprehensive immigration reform.In a letter to the White House, the group calls the legislation, already passed by the Senate, an “awful deal” for American workers and questions how Obama could champion higher wages for them while backing a law that allows millions of low-skilled workers into the U.S. labor force.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“We write to you today on behalf of the 21 million Americans who can’t find a full-time job,” writes Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks and 15 other largely conservative House members. “Comprehensive immigration reform may be a good deal for big businesses that want to reduce labor costs. And it may be a good deal for progressive labor unions seeking new workers from abroad. But it’s an awful deal for U.S. workers.”The letter essentially lays out the larger, multi-faceted debate in Washington and across the country on immigration that has been a top priority for Obama.All sides largely agree that the country must fix a federal immigration system under which roughly 11 million people are living illegally in the United States.But supporters and critics mostly disagree on whether reform will improve the economy and if it should include a path to citizenship.Although the leaders of the GOP-led House appear willing to pass some form of immigration legislation, they face increasing pressure from a powerful coalition -- including Big Business and Big Labor -- to agree to a comprehensive deal.“We’re determined to make 2014 the year that immigration reform is finally enacted,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said Wednesday, outlining the influential group’s agenda for the year. “The chamber will pull out all the stops -- through grassroots lobbying, communications, politics, and partnerships with unions, faith organizations, law enforcement, and others -- to get it done … Immigration reform is important to expanding (economic) opportunity as well.”Meanwhile, Obama critics argue the White House is pushing for an immigration policy that would flood the labor market.The president, through much of last year, said he was okay with the House taking a piece-by-piece approach, “as long as all … pieces get done.”However, before departing for winter vacation, the president appeared to push the lower chamber toward the more comprehensive plan.“There are a few differences here and there, but the truth of the matter is that the Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country,” he said. “So let’s go ahead and get that done.”The letter to Obama argues “the White House has entertained a parade of high-powered business executives to discuss immigration policy, all while shutting out the concerns of everyday wage-earners who overwhelmingly oppose these measures.” Opponents of comprehensive reform have also pointed to House Speaker John Boehner last month hiring a former director for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a pro-immigration group, as a sign of his desire to pass a comprehensive bill.“Job number one for Congress should be to reduce the unemployment rolls, get families and communities out of poverty and government dependency, rebuild our deteriorating communities and collapsing middle class, and increase wages for American citizens,” the letter concludes. “Your immigration proposals do the exact opposite on every count.” Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
House GOP Leaders To Present Immigration Reform Principles WASHINGTON (AP) –  House Republican leaders plan to outline broad immigration principles, including legalization for the 11 million immigrants living here illegally, to the GOP rank and file as they look to revive long-stalled efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration system.- Mario Diaz-BalartSpeaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other House GOP leaders will measure the willingness of party members to tackle immigration in a midterm election year when they unveil the principles Thursday at the GOP caucus' annual retreat in Cambridge, Md."We're going to outline our standards, principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with our members, and once that conversation's over we'll have a better feel for what members have in mind," Boehner told reporters this week.Boehner faces strong opposition from several conservatives who fear that legislation will lead to citizenship for people who broke U.S. immigration laws, are suspicious of President Barack Obama and his enforcement of any law and are reluctant to give the president a long-sought legislative victory.Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, delivered a 30-page package to all 232 House Republicans on Wednesday that offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the expected principles.Sessions warned of the negative impact of proposed changes in immigration policy on U.S. workers, taxpayers and the rule of law as the House leaders look at legalization for some of the 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Sessions and other opponents argue that legal status and work authorization amounts to amnesty and serves as a path to citizenship.Responding to Obama's renewed call for immigration legislation and the positive signals from House GOP leaders, Sessions said Republicans "must end the lawlessness — not surrender to it — and they must defend the legitimate interests of millions of struggling American workers."Separately, several lawmakers were working on legislation dealing with children of parents in the United States illegally and visas for guest workers.Republicans insist that the party must pass reforms and address the issue of those in the country illegally to be competitive in presidential elections. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested that immigrants "self-deport," won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote."It's no secret we have millions of people who are here, who are unlawful and we can't deny that, and I think that's something that has to be dealt with," said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who has been working on legislation. "But a lot of components have to be dealt with."The Senate last year passed a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that addressed border security, provided enforcement measures and offered a path to citizenship for those living here illegally. The measure stalled in the GOP-led House, where leaders want to take a more piecemeal approach.Sessions' analysis said increasing the number of immigrants would hurt an already weak economy, lower wages and increase unemployment. He cited White House adviser Gene Sperling's comment earlier this month that the economy has three people looking for every job opening.He said the House GOP leaders' plan that's taking shape would grant work permits almost immediately to those here illegally, giving them a chance to compete with unemployed Americans for any job.

House hangs IRS hopes on Holder's help  **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**Buzz Cut: • House hangs IRS hopes on Holder’s help • Election year ObamaCare delay to add $6.2 trillion to debt • Ya think? Coy Hillary says ‘I am thinking about’ 2016 • Baier Tracks: Think green • Flying burrito brawlers ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTHOUSE HANGS IRS HOPES ON HOLDER’S HELPHouse Republicans are winding up to hold former IRS executive Lois Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about the agency’s targeting of President Obama’s political enemies. But as long as a criminal investigation bobs along at the Obama Justice Department, there’s little to cause Lerner to get chatty. The open investigation gives her a Fifth Amendment haven. So what can frustrated lawmakers do? House members today will debate whether to ask the Justice Department to seek criminal contempt charges against Lerner beyond the allegations of wrongdoing in the corruption scandal itself. You read that right. House Republicans want to ask an attorney general whom they have held in contempt of Congress for almost two years for failing to provide documents to bring contempt charges against a former fellow administration official. Gotcha.[Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest developments on the Lerner contempt charges from Capitol Hill.]Hey, buddy - Based on Attorney General Eric Holder’s dismissive showing in testimony Tuesday, there’s little reason to believe that he thinks much of the demands of the House of Representatives. Holder has stymied Republicans on not only the botched gunrunning sting that led to his contempt of Congress charge in 2012 but also the doctored White House talking points on the Islamist raid in Benghazi, Libya, the Justice Department’s snooping on journalists, domestic surveillance polices and more. When Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, mocked Holder for not caring about being in contempt, the attorney general flared: “You don't want to go there, buddy.” Holder added that the contempt charge was “inappropriate” and “unjust” and cautioned Gohmert “never think that was not a big deal to me. Don’t ever think that.” Sounds like just the guy to help Republicans out on cornering Lois Lerner, right?[Farenthold: Holder should be ‘in jail’ - Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, refused to question Holder during the same hearing saying that it was wrong to allow him to testify under a contempt finding. “If an American citizen had not complied with one of the Justice Department’s subpoenas,” Farenthold said, “they would be in jail and not sitting here in front of me testifying.”]Immovable objects - With the impossibly short memories of the members of the establishment press when it comes to the scandals that have beset the Obama administration (even the one that includes the journalistic profession), Holder has been able to persist in his post. Republicans may feel obliged to go through the motions with Holder and the IRS case, but there’s little indication that this attorney general or this administration can be moved. Holder has said he plans to stay in office “well into 2014” if not longer even though a rules change in the Senate would allow Democrats to push through a replacement on a party-line vote. Plus he kind of seems to be enjoying making Republicans crazy.[Holder is scheduled to speak today on his push for expanded gun-control measures at an event hosted by former Justice Department cooperative non-rodent Al Sharpton in New York.]DEMS’ ELECTION YEAR OBAMACARE DELAY WILL ADD $6.2 TRILLION TO DEBTWashington Examiner’s Phillip Klein tallies up the cost to taxpayers of the Obama administration decision to punt on scheduled cuts to the popular Medicare Advantage program amid growing anger among older voters. “According to the Government Accountability Office, if Obamacare’s Medicare cuts don’t get implemented, instead of decreasing deficits, the law would increase long-term deficits by $6.2 trillion.”DIRE WARNING ON HEALTH OF OBAMACARE ENROLLEESNYT: “People who signed up early for insurance through the new marketplaces were more likely to be prescribed drugs to treat pain, depression and H.I.V. and were less likely to need contraceptives, according to a new study that provides a much-anticipated look at the population that signed up for coverage under the new health care law… The study, to be released Wednesday by the major pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts, suggests that early enrollees face more serious health problems and are older than those covered by their employers. The study also showed a higher use of specialty drugs, which are often used to treat diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; the use of such drugs could hint at more costly medical problems.”High cost of low enrollment - Forbes’ Avik Roy examines a survey from the RAND Corporation that shows the number of uninsured Americans who bought policies under ObamaCare is a fraction of the number estimated by government numbers crunchers when calculating the cost of the law – perhaps 20 percent of enrollees rather than the 80 percent to 90 percent forecast by congressional economists. What’s that mean? Costlier insurance for those already covered and even higher deficits down the road.HOUSE TRIES TO HEM OBAMA’S INTERNET PLAN President Obama’s move to cede a key U.S. control over the Internet is not sitting well with members of Congress who worry about abuses by authoritarian governments, security and freedom of commerce. A House panel will take up a measure that would direct the Government Accountability Office to study the decision to relinquish the authority, set to occur in October 2015, and present a non-partisan evaluation before taking any action. –Watch Fox: Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen looks at how Congress is reacting to the proposal.[Kirsten Powers examines Kickstarter’s attempt to censor a film about abortionist Dr. Kermit Gosnell in Liberals' mob rule.]WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE... CNET’s Greg Lukianoff examines Twitter, hate speech, and the costs of keeping quiet: “Part of the wisdom of First Amendment law is that it recognizes that we flawed humans will be tempted to ban speech for no better reason than that officials (or voters) simply dislike or disapprove of an idea or a particular speaker. That's why First Amendment doctrine forbids the use of highly subjective standards, which would invite arbitrary punishment of dissenters, oddballs, satirists, or the misunderstood. Too many scholars seem to think a robot could simply apply such standards to produce a perfect outcome every time… Twitter lets us see people as they are -- a mixed lot on any given day, to be sure.

COY HILLARY SAYS ‘I AM THINKING ABOUT’ 2016Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said she “thinking about” a 2016 presidential bid, and is considering the “hard questions” in making her decision. Clinton’s lean forward came in a speech to tech investors in San Francisco, part of her Western campaign and cash-hauling swing this week. Clinton re-emphasized her late lament of partisanship, decrying “political dysfunction.” In what might be seen as an answer to Obama Democrats who complain that her seemingly endless presidential preparations are sapping strength from already weakened Democrats facing voters this fall, Clinton said she wished the country had a more “limited campaign period” so “we could pay attention to the upcoming elections this year.” Clinton didn’t expand on her 2016 status in a speech in Portland later Tuesday. She’ll continue the western swing in Las Vegas on Thursday.Bubba stays Down South - Speaking in the key 2016 primary state of South Carolina at an event to honor his former Educations Secretary, former Gov. Dick Riley, D-S.C., Bill Clinton was also calling for a new political tone. The former president said: “The future will belong, in my opinion, to people who try to cultivate our interesting differences but grounded in the simple fact that our common humanity matters more. Most people spend 99-and-a-half percent of their time worrying about the half-a-percent of us that’s different.

House Majority Leader Cantor Calls Obama Insincere For Blaming Immigration Impasse On GOP House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said President Barack Obama attacked the same lawmakers he's supposed to be working with on immigration during a phone call between the two on Wednesday.The Virginia Republican says Obama called him Wednesday to discuss Obama's desire for an immigration overhaul. The call came after Obama released a statement accusing Republicans of repeatedly failing to act and of being behind the times on immigration.Cantor says Obama still hasn't learned how to work effectively with Congress. He says Obama's statement shows he has no sincere desire to work together.“The president called me hours after he issued a partisan statement which attacked me and my fellow House Republicans and which indicated no sincere desire to work together,” Cantor said in a statement, according to Politico. “After five years, President Obama still has not learned how to effectively work with Congress to get things done.“You do not attack the very people you hope to engage in a serious dialogue,” he continued.Obama supports a bipartisan Senate bill that has stalled in the House, where Republicans have stated that they prefer a piecemeal approach. Cantor says House Republicans don't support the Senate bill and the House won't vote on it.“Unfortunately, Republicans in the House of Representatives have repeatedly failed to take action, seemingly preferring the status quo of a broken immigration system over meaningful reform,” Obama said in a statement earlier Wednesday. “Instead of advancing common-sense reform and working to fix our immigration system, House Republicans have voted in favor of extreme measures like a punitive amendment to strip protections from ‘Dreamers.’”The White House took issue with Cantor's version of events, arguing that Obama had called Cantor, who is Jewish, to wish him a happy Passover, and immigration came up during the call. A White House official described the call as "pleasant" and said the White House was surprised by the description of the call circulated by Cantor's staff, adding that it didn't reflect what had actually transpired.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wasn't authorized to comment by name.House Democrats reacted angrily to Cantor’s accusations and accused Cantor of playing politics instead of working to solve the immigration issue.“In response to the president’s renewed call for action on comprehensive immigration reform, Congressman Cantor once again offered only excuses for inaction,” said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
House Majority Whip McCarthy Says No Immigration Reform In 2013 Washington –  The third-ranking House Republican told immigration advocates that lawmakers won't vote this year on the issue, confirming what many had long assumed.California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip, said in a meeting with immigration proponents that there weren't enough days left for the House to act and he was committed to addressing overhaul of the nation's immigration system next year. The congressman's office confirmed what he said.Angelica Salas, the board chairwoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, described her conversation with McCarthy in a conference call with reporters on Friday and a subsequent interview with The Associated Press.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill in June that would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and tighten border security, but piecemeal bills in the House have languished since the summer."What he said was, there's 13 days left, it's very hard to do anything in 13 days," Salas said of McCarthy.The House returns next week after a weeklong break, but only has a few legislative days remaining.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill in June that would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and tighten border security, but piecemeal bills in the House have languished since the summer.Salas and about a dozen women occupied McCarthy's Bakersfield, Calif., office on Thursday to increase the pressure on the Republican to move ahead on immigration legislation. Around 11 p.m. that night, McCarthy and his wife, Judy, met with the group protesting the delay."He said, 'Ladies, I hear you want to talk to me. This is just not the way to do it,'" Salas recalled. She said McCarthy and the group spoke for about an hour, and the women explained that while they appreciated his support for immigration reform, it was imperative for the House to act as soon as possible."This is about political will to do what is right," Salas said. "This is what we're challenging."Most House Republicans reject a comprehensive approach as well as the Senate bill, with many questioning the offer of citizenship to people who broke U.S. immigration laws to be in this country. The House Judiciary Committee has moved forward with individual, single-issue immigration bills.Erica Elliott, a spokeswoman for McCarthy, said Friday that he "supports fixing our broken immigration system. He also believes that it is incumbent upon all participants in the debate to work together to address immigration reform on an issue-by-issue basis rather than demanding that any reform only happen in the context of a massive bill that fails to appropriately address the underlying problems plaguing the current process."Although House Republican leaders say they want to resolve the issue, which has become a political drag for the GOP, many rank-and-file House Republicans have shown little inclination to deal with immigration. The bitter standoff with President Barack Obama on the budget and near default further angered House Republicans, who have resisted any move that might give Obama an immigration overhaul, the top item on his second-term domestic agenda.Many House Republicans also are wary of passing any immigration legislation that would set up a conference with the Democratic-controlled Senate, fearing the House could lose out in final negotiations.The Senate bill, strongly backed by the White House, includes billions for border security, a reworked legal immigration system to allow tens of thousands of high- and low-skilled workers into the country and a 13-year path to citizenship for those living here illegally.The conference call was sponsored by America's Voice, an advocacy group.Details of McCarthy's conversation comes as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops stepped up pressure on the House to act on immigration legislation before the end of the year, calling the issue "a matter of great moral urgency" that cannot wait.Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Thursday that he was troubled by reports that immigration reform is delayed in the House since lawmakers have a responsibility to resolve the issue. Writing on behalf of the 450-plus U.S. cardinals and bishops, Dolan said they respectfully request that the House address the immigration issue as soon as possible."As a moral matter ... our nation cannot continue to receive the benefits of the work and contributions of undocumented immigrants without extending to them the protection of the law," Dolan wrote. "Keeping these human beings as a permanent underclass of workers who are unable to assert their rights or enjoy the fruits of their labor is a stain on the soul of the nation."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
House Republicans face challenge on immigration from Senate colleague Jan. 28, 2014: House Speaker John Boehner, left, with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, talks with reporters at Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington.APWASHINGTON –  House Republicans are getting pressure from a key Senate Republican and others as they get ready to tackle legislation aimed at overhauling the nation’s immigration system.Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, delivered a 30-page package to all 232 House Republicans on Wednesday that offers a point-by-point rebuttal to the expected immigration guidelines that House Speaker John Boehner and other leaders plan to circulate this week among GOP members.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTSessions told members of his party they must “end the lawlessness – not surrender to it" – and they must defend the legitimate interests of millions of struggling American workers.Part of the 30-page package included a memo from Sessions, an analysis from his staff on the Senate Budget and Judiciary committees and a summary of opposition from conservatives. It was delivered shortly before House Republicans left Washington for their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md.High on the retreat's agenda is immigration, which Republican leaders hope to tackle this election year despite strong opposition from some members. The starting point is a statement of principles that is expected to focus on border and interior security, legalization for some of the 11 million immigrants living here illegally and ensuring that Obama enforces any law, according to lawmakers, congressional aides and outside advocates, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the principles being drafted."We're going to outline our standards, principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with our members, and once that conversation's over we'll have a better feel for what members have in mind," Boehner told reporters this week.Separately, several lawmakers are working on legislation dealing with children of parents in the United States illegally, visas for guest workers and legalization that would require immigrants to pay fines and back taxes.Republicans insist that the party must pass reforms and address the issue of the 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally to be competitive in presidential elections. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested that immigrants "self-deport," won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote."It's no secret we have millions of people who are here, who are unlawful and we can't deny that and I think that's something that has to be dealt with," said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who has been working on legislation, "but lot of components have to be dealt with."The Senate last year passed a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that addressed border security, provided enforcement measures and offered a path to citizenship for those living here illegally. The measure stalled in the GOP-led House, where leaders want to take a more piecemeal approach.In his memo, Sessions warned of the negative impact of the House immigration proposal on U.S. workers, taxpayers and the rule of law.His analysis said increasing the number of immigrants would hurt an already weak economy, lower wages and increase unemployment. He cited White House adviser Gene Sperling's comment earlier this month that the economy has three people looking for every job opening.He said the House GOP leaders' plan that's taking shape would grant work permits almost immediately to those here illegally, giving them a chance to compete with unemployed Americans for any job. He said it would lead to a surge in unskilled workers and would provide amnesty to a larger number of immigrants in the country illegally, giving them a chance to apply for citizenship through green cards."House Republicans, in crafting immigration principles, should reply to the president's immigration campaign with a simple message: Our focus is to help unemployed Americans get back to work, not to grant amnesty or to answer the whims of immigration activists and CEOs," Sessions said in his memo.FoxNews.com obtained a copy of Sessions' critique.Notably, two members of the House leadership, Boehner and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., spoke about dealing with the broken immigration system in their responses to Obama's State of the Union address. How rank-and-file Republicans will respond is unclear, especially with a great deal of GOP wariness about whether Obama can be trusted to enforce an immigration law.Obama's waiver or suspension of provisions of his four-year-old health care law have increased suspicions among Republicans, and Sessions' analysis highlighted the president's State of the Union comments that he might act unilaterally on some issues if Congress balks.Diaz-Balart expressed cautious optimism, putting the odds of House action on immigration at 30 percent, up from 5 percent earlier."There's a consensus that the system is broken and I'm seeing more and more a desire to fix it," he said in an interview. "Speaker Boehner has been very clear, leadership has been very clear. We're going to do it methodically, that we're going to look at it case by case, step by step, we're not going to rush it."The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
GOP objects to Obama administration easing immigration rules for terror supporters  The Obama administration's use of an executive directive to ease the rules for people trying to enter the United States or stay in the country even though they have given “limited” support to terrorists or terror groups is causing problems for Republicans working on immigration reform."President Obama should be protecting U.S. citizens rather than taking a chance on those who are aiding and abetting terrorist activity and putting Americans at greater risk," says Virginia GOP Rep. Robert Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and part of the GOP House leadership team working on immigration reform.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTHe and other Republican lawmakers argued that the administration is relaxing rules designed by Congress to protect the country from terrorists.And Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt on "Fox News Sunday" repeated the concerns of fellow Republicans and others about Obama repeatedly saying that "he can use his pen and his telephone" to work around Congress.The change is one of Obama's first actions on immigration since he pledged during his State of the Union address last month to use more executive directives.The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department now say that people considered to have provided "limited material support" to terrorists or terrorist groups are no longer automatically barred from the United States.A post-Sept. 11 provision in immigrant law, known as terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds, had affected anyone considered to have given support to terror groups. With little exception, the provision has been applied rigidly to those trying to enter the U.S. and those already here but wanting to change their immigration status.The Democrat-controlled Senate last year passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a 13-year path to citizenship to some of the estimated 11 million people now living illegally in the United States. The Republican-led House has shown signs recently about a desire to at least offer legal status for some illegal immigrants, but suggested last week such legislation will not get passed this year.For Morteza Assadi, a 49-year-old real estate agent in northern Virginia, the law has left him in a sort of immigration purgatory while his green card application has been on hold for more than a decade.As a teenager in Tehran, Iran, in the early 1980s, Assadi distributed fliers for a mujahedeen group that opposed the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and was at one time considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Assadi said he told the U.S. government about his activities when he and his wife applied for asylum in the late 1990s. Those requests were later granted and his wife has since become a U.S. citizen. But Assadi's case has remained stalled."When we are teenagers, we have different mindsets," Assadi said. "I thought, I'm doing my country a favor."Assadi said he only briefly associated with the group, which was removed from Washington's list of terrorist organizations in 2012, and that he was never an active member or contributor to its activities. Now he's hopeful that the U.S. government will look at his teenage activities as "limited."His lawyer, Parastoo Zahedi, said she has filed a case in federal court to force U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process Assadi's green card application, but now hopes the government will act on its own."In the past, the minute your name was associated with a [terrorist] organization you were being punished," Zahedi said. "Not every act is a terrorist act and you can't just lump everyone together."The Homeland Security Department said in a statement that the rule change, which was announced last week and not made in concert with Congress, gives the government more discretion, but won't open the country to terrorists or their sympathizers. People seeking refugee status, asylum and visas, including those already in the United States, still will be checked to make sure they don't pose a threat to national security or public safety, the department said.In the past, the provision has been criticized for allowing few exemptions beyond providing medical care or acting under duress. The change now allows officials to consider whether the support was not only limited but potentially part of "routine commercial transactions or routine social transactions."The change does not specifically address "freedom fighters" who may have fought against an established government, including members of rebel groups who have led revolts in Arab Spring uprisings.In late 2011, Citizenship and Immigration Services said about 4,400 affected cases were on hold as the government reviewed possible exemptions to the rule. It's unclear how many of those cases are still pending.Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the rule change will help people he described as deserving refugees and asylum-seekers."The existing interpretation was so broad as to be unworkable," Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement. He said the previous rule barred applicants for reasons "that no rational person would consider."The Associated Press contributed to this report.   Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
House Speaker John Boehner Comes Out Swinging Against Friend And Foe Alike House Speaker John Boehner was pulling no punches on Thursday.First, he challenged allies of the United States who want America to show strong leadership globally, and then he said he wants his congressional colleagues to stop shying away from immigration reform.Boehner said other countries are looking for the United States to lead, and that the 150 troops now in Poland with similar contingents planned for three other European countries is a step in the right direction. With tensions growing over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the arrival of 150 paratroopers for joint exercises in Poland on Wednesday is considered a sign of President Barack Obama's commitment to security in Europe.- House Speaker John Boehner, speaking about fellow Republicans"They're begging us to lead, and they want us to lead," Boehner told a Middletown Rotary Club luncheon. "And I have to say, I was pleased with the news late yesterday that the president is in fact sending ... troops to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."Boehner said that American leadership lets the world know "what the rules are" and that U.S. allies want more of it."When America's not leading, when America's not strong, the bad guys know they can stick their heads up with impunity," Boehner said.Boehner also expressed frustration with those in Congress who are reluctant to tackle immigration reform this year. Boehner mocked those he said lack an appetite for addressing needed changes."Here's the attitude, 'Oh, don't make me do this. Oh, this is too hard,'" Boehner said, affecting a whiny voice. He added that some of his colleagues would rather take the path of "least resistance.""We get elected to solve problems," Boehner said.Boehner and other GOP leaders offered a set of immigration principles in January, but rank-and-file members balked at moving ahead. In the past, Boehner has blamed Republicans' distrust of the President for lack of movement on the legislation.The issue is a difficult one for congressmen facing midterm elections this year. Boehner himself has three Republican opponents in a May 6 primary for Ohio's 8th District, which he first won in 1990.After the comments, Democrats and immigration advocates seized on the principal Republican congressional leader mocking his own GOP allies for their reluctance to take up immigration legislation.On Friday, Latino advocates noted that it's Boehner's job as Speaker of the House to bring the issue to a vote, not to blame others. Democrats made the same point.Boehner's office attempted to downplay the apparent rift, noting that he often has said to colleagues, "You only tease the ones you love."The Associated Press contributed to this story.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
How The Republican Party Constructed An Ironclad Advantage In The Midterm Election WASHINGTON (AP) –  Even if Democrats recruit great candidates, raise gobs of money and run smart campaigns, they face an uphill fight to retake control of the House in this year's congressional elections, regardless of the political climate in November.The reason? Republican strategists spent years developing a plan to take advantage of the 2010 census, first by winning state legislatures and then redrawing House districts to tilt the playing field in their favor. Their success was unprecedented.In states like Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina, Republicans were able to shape congressional maps to pack as many Democratic voters as possible into the fewest House districts. The practice is called gerrymandering, and it left fertile ground elsewhere in each state to spread Republican voters among more districts, increasing the GOP's chances of winning more seats.Geography helped in some states. Democratic voters are more likely to live in densely populated urban areas, making it easier to pack them into fewer districts.The first payoff came in 2012, when Republicans kept control of the House despite a Democratic wave that swept President Barack Obama to a second term. The next payoff is likely to come this fall when candidates once again compete in House districts drawn by Republican legislators in key states.Gerrymandering has a long history in the United States, pursued enthusiastically by both Democrats and Republicans. But the GOP's success at it this decade has been historic: In 2012, Republicans maintained a 33-seat majority in the House, even though GOP candidates as a group got 1.4 million fewer votes than their Democratic opponents.It was only the second time since World War II that the party receiving the most votes failed to win a majority of House seats, according to statistics compiled by the House Clerk. Democrats gained eight seats but were still a minority."The fact that Republicans controlled redistricting (after 2010) meant that they were able to build up a wall, stopping a lot of the tide from running out," said Justin Levitt, a law professor and redistricting expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "They were able to shore up a lot of the districts that had been won by, in many cases, tea party freshmen or other Republican freshmen."The Republicans' advantage will fade as the decade wears on and the population changes. In the meantime, lopsided House districts are having a direct impact on the ability of Congress to tackle tough issues. House districts are drawn so that Democrats and Republicans often represent very different groups of people with different views on divisive issues. That can make it hard to find common ground.Democrats control the White House and the Senate, though control of the Senate will be up for grabs in November. Republicans control the House, giving them powerful leverage to block Obama's second-term agenda.How did Republicans gain their historic advantage? It all started with the party's sweeping victories in 2010 and a plan called REDMAP.The 2010 election was a disaster for Democrats. Voters were angry over bank bailouts, the poor economy, ballooning budget deficits and Obama's new health law, which had just passed Congress without a single Republican vote. All these issues fueled the rise of conservative tea party groups that backed Republican candidates up and down the ballot.Obama called the election "a shellacking."Republicans picked up 63 seats to win control of the House. They also gained seats in the Senate, though Democrats kept their majority.Perhaps more important, Republicans won control of state legislatures in key states, giving the party the edge that is still paying dividends.Every 10 years following the census, states redraw the boundaries of House districts to account for population changes. Some states gain seats and others lose them, so the overall total remains 435. In most states, the legislature and the governor draw up the new districts, which is why political parties pay special attention to elections at the start of each decade."I think Democrats made a terrible mistake. They did not put nearly enough attention or resources into legislative races at the state level," said Matt Bennett, a former aide to President Bill Clinton. "A bunch of these legislatures slipped by very narrow margins, and some of them flipped for the first time since Reconstruction in the South."For Republicans, it was a combination of luck and planning. The political winds were in their favor, but they also had been plotting for years to take full advantage of redistricting.The project was called REDMAP, which stood for Redistricting Majority Project. It called for targeting statehouse races in states that were expected to gain or lose congressional seats following the census. GOP strategists reasoned that redistricting could have a greater impact in these states because there would have to be more changes to district boundaries, said Chris Jankowski, former president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which heads up the party's national effort to elect candidates to state offices.Republicans spent more than $30 million through REDMAP to help elect legislative majorities in states like Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Jankowski said.In Ohio, REDMAP spent nearly $1 million on six Ohio House races. Republican candidates won five, helping them take control of the Ohio House.In Pennsylvania, REDMAP spent nearly $1 million on three state House races, winning all three and helping Republicans win a majority in the Pennsylvania House."We're not talking about 2-month-long broadcast buys on network TV that never stop, like you see in a U.S. Senate battle," Jankowski said. "We're talking about cable, radio, mail, ground game â very basic stuff."Similar scenarios played out in Michigan and Wisconsin. In North Carolina, Republicans won control of the entire state legislature for the first time since the 1800s."We targeted the resources to have maximum impact on congressional redistricting," Jankowski said.The strategy worked. Before the 2010 election, the GOP had majorities in 36 state legislative bodies. Afterward, the party controlled 56, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.In almost half the states, Republicans won control of the entire redistricting process. They gained control of at least one legislative chamber in other states, limiting Democrats' ability to draw districts favoring their candidates.Democrats' statehouse losses in 2010 were "a catastrophe that is going to have a much bigger impact on Obama's second term than the congressional elections that year did, because it's much more durable," Bennett said.In all, Republicans controlled the process of drawing the boundaries for 210 House districts, compared to just 44 districts for Democrats, according to statistics compiled by Levitt. The rest were drawn by divided government, the courts, or in a handful of mostly western states, independent commissions.Six states illustrate the Republicans' advantage in House elections: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin and Florida. Obama won all six in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. But the House delegation for each state is overwhelmingly Republican.It might seem like voters split their ballots â voting for a Democrat for president and a Republican for Congress. But that's not what happened.To help analyze voting patterns in congressional districts, The Associated Press divided the votes from the 2012 presidential election into all 435 House districts.Since Obama got the most votes, you might think he won the most congressional districts. But he didn't.Nationally, Obama received nearly 5 million more votes than Republican Mitt Romney. But in some states, large numbers of Obama's votes were packed into heavily Democratic congressional districts. As a result, Romney won 17 more House districts than Obama.Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin and Florida accounted for the entire disparity. Obama won the statewide vote, but Romney won the most congressional districts in each state.Republicans engineered these disparities by packing large numbers of Democrats into relatively few districts. This resulted in lopsided Democratic districts. For example, Obama won more than 80 percent of the vote in 26 House districts spread across 10 states.Republican voters were spread more evenly. As a result, Romney won more than 80 percent of the vote in just a single House district, in the Texas panhandle.Lopsided districts help explain why Congress is so polarized. The divide is reflected in demographic differences, which can shape the debate on a variety of issues.â Immigration. The average Democratic district has about twice as many Hispanic residents as the typical Republican district. This helps explain why House Republicans have less incentive to pass an immigration bill that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of people living in the U.S. illegally.â Minimum wage. Democrats represent the vast majority of districts with large pockets of low-income workers and families living in poverty. That helps explain why Democrats are more eager than Republicans to raise the minimum wage. Interestingly, Democrats also represent most of the wealthiest districts, along the East and West Coasts.â Health care. Democrats represent the vast majority of districts with high concentrations of people who had no health insurance before Obama's new health law, one of many reasons Democrats and Republicans view the law so differently.Independent experts give Democrats little chance to retake the House this year. Even beyond Republicans' redistricting advantage, the party of the president usually loses seats in Congress during midterm elections.Still, Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who is in charge of the House Democrats' campaign operation, rejects arguments that Democrats can't do it, regardless of the map."There's no question that midterm elections are more challenging for the party whose president is in power," Israel said.Jankowski, on the other hand, expects Republican candidates to continue enjoying the fruits of redistricting. But he notes that people move and populations change. As the decade wears on, the political benefits diminish, and another redistricting battle will loom."It has a shelf life to it and it's usually not the full 10 years," Jankowski said. "That's the reason we have a census every 10 years."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Humans are the true wealth of nations APWhat’s the quickest way to increase the wealth of a nation? Increase the immigration of knowledgeable people.The current value of all of America’s physical capital, like factories and buildings, is about $45 trillion. But the value of all human capital is 16 times that—about $740 trillion.  Immigration adds human capital to the United States in the cheapest way.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTHuman wealth-creating potential is exemplified by stories of individuals overcoming adversity to advance scientific knowledge, start firms, or create a tasty new cuisine.For example, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, a company so widely used that its name has become a verb, came as a refugee from the Soviet Union.  It’s unlikely that he would have co-created Google in the Communist USSR or today’s chaotic Russia – where businessmen like Mikhail Khodorkovsky are locked up at whim.     Then there are the numerous German Jewish chemists who fled Nazi Germany ahead of the Holocaust. They jumpstarted an industrial revival that eventually increased innovation in the American chemical industry of about 10 percent, according to research by economists at Stanford and the University of Warwick.   It’s not just higher skilled immigrants who innovate and contribute to a nation’s wealth.  Alfredo Quinones-Hinijosa grew up in the village of Palaco, Mexico.  As he told NPR, “I was literally hungry for food. My stomach was empty.”  Because there was no legal way for Quinones-Hinijosa to legally immigrate, he hopped a fence and toiled in agriculture.  He eventually worked his way through community college, the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard Medical School.  Quinones eventually became a citizen and is now director of the brain tumor program at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical center, specializing in advanced surgical treatments for a variety of brain and spinal tumors.Innovations in food often begin with an infusion of foreign talent, spices, and skills.  Japanese restaurateur Nobuyuki Matsuhisa, or “Nobu,” is one such example. As Los Angeles Times food critic S. Irene Virbila wrote, Nobu’s “canon of stylish fusion sushi have influenced a generation – more likely two generations – of sushi chefs across the country.”  Nobu gained experience in Japan and Peru before choosing the United States as the homebase of his world-wide restaurant enterprise.There are downsides to kicking out human capital. A notorious example is that of Chinese immigrant Qian Xuesen, who earned his Ph.D. from the Cal Tech in 1939.  During World War II, Xuesen worked to develop a rocket that could counter Nazi Germay’s V-2.  In 1950, Xuesen was accused of being a Communist. Without evidence, he lost all of his security clearances.  Denied all of his opportunities to work in the United States, he tried to leave but was detained and traded for American pilots shot down during the Korean War  – to China, where he went on to design missile systems. U.S.Undersecretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball, who knew Xuesen personally, said "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did.  He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go."  If every country allowed free markets to flourish as much as the United State, the world wouldn’t miss out on much innovation.  But because predatory governments rule much of the world, innovative immigrants need to be allowed to come to relatively free places like the United States or else their talents will be wasted – to everyone’s loss.  A rational immigration system that allows hardworking people to come to America legally can grow our human capital – and expand our economic.Alex Nowrasteh is the immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)The Associated PressSEATTLE –  Police fired pepper spray and arrested a half dozen people Thursday night as anti-capitalist marchers meandered through Seattle, hours after hundreds of peaceful demonstrators took part in a May Day march in support of immigrant rights and a boost in the minimum wage.Police said they used pepper spray after some marchers threw bottles at officers in downtown Seattle. Protesters later started trash can fires in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Another arrest came after a brick was hurled at officers. A gun was recovered from one of those arrested, police said.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBy late Thursday night, the anti-capitalist protesters had marched in a rambling circuit from Capitol Hill to downtown Seattle and back again before police hemmed them in. Some tossed firecrackers at police, officers said.All through the day and night, Seattle police were out in force on bicycles, foot and horseback. They supplemented their numbers with officers from several other jurisdictions.Violence has plagued May Day in Seattle during the past two years, with protesters challenging police in the streets and sometimes stealing the thunder of much larger daytime events.Last year, police arrested 18 people from a crowd that pelted them with rocks and bottles.Seattle police noted a marked uptick in anti-authority rhetoric leading up to this year's May Day events, said Capt. Chris Fowler, in charge of the department's response to the demonstrations.Police escorted both the permitted march of immigration and labor activists and later, unpermitted marches, allowing them to block traffic but prepared to step in to stop property damage.Businesses downtown also prepared, posting security guards outside, taping paper over their windows to discourage graffiti, and using metal coat hangers to tie down iron grates along the sidewalks.The earlier boisterous May Day rally started in south Seattle and headed to Westlake Park downtown, with demonstrators waving red signs seeking an end to deportations and "poverty wages" and calling for a $15-an-hour minimum wage.Earlier Thursday, Mayor Ed Murray announced a plan to phase in a $15 minimum wage in the city over the next seven years.Daniel Stender, 26, was at the rally holding a sign pushing for quicker action on getting to a $15 minimum wage."It's getting ridiculous. It's getting to the point where you can't afford things," he said.The police department's blog said vandals spray-painted a few businesses early Thursday in the Capitol Hill neighborhood — a car dealership, bank, restaurant and "the neighborhood headquarters of the oppressive regime at the United States Postal Service."Officers also found "Kill SPD" painted on the bank, and a flier was circulated calling for killing officers. 
Hunger strikers ask Obama to stop deportations With the aim of getting President Barack Obama to listen to their requests that he stop deportations, three people on Tuesday began a hunger strike in front of the White House.They told Efe that they will continue with their protest as long as their health permits.Cynthia Diaz, an 18-year-old college student, said that her mother, who is undocumented, was taken from their home in Phoenix on March 16 by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents."We know that the probability of deportations is very high, but that's why I came here, because I want the president to listen to me," the Arizona native said.She said that for the past two weeks she has been preparing for the hunger strike in Washington's Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where campaign tents have been set up to house the strikers."I'm going to be here until my body reaches its limit. I know I have a very small body, but I'm going to be strong and be all that I can be," Diaz said.Some 40 demonstrators from California, Arizona and the nation's capital on Tuesday participated in the activities surrounding the launching of the hunger strike.Jose Valdez, 55, one of the three strikers, said that his son has been held for the past 19 months at an immigration detention center in Phoenix.Nayra Zapata, 19, who was born in Puebla, Mexico, said amid tears that she plans not to eat until the authorities release the father of her two sons.The organizations involved in organizing the hunger strike have coordinated with doctors who will continuously oversee the health of the strikers.Two-thirds of the more than 2 million people deported since Obama took office in January 2009 were individuals who had committed minor offenses, such as traffic violations, The New York Times reported last Sunday.The White House, however, maintains that 98 percent of deportations by ICE have been in line with the priorities set by the administration, with a focus on threats to national security, public safety and border security.

Activists Ask Boehner To Show "Courage" In Pushing Forward Immigration Reform Washington, D.C. (EFE) –  A group of about 80 immigrants and pro-immigration activists on Tuesday asked the Republican speaker of the House, John Boehner to show "courage" in approving immigration reform when they delivered to his congressional office some cardboard medallions on which that word was written.With this symbolic gesture, organized by the Fair Immigration Reform Movement, or FIRM, the group asked Boehner to change the current immigration system, given that it - they said - separates hundreds of families each day.The activists, who came to the nation's capital from at least 20 states, marched through the halls of Congress wearing around their necks the "courage" medallions and deposited them at Boehner's office, chiding him for being a "coward" for not allowing a House vote on the new immigration bill.This act of protest was launched at the summit on immigration reform that FIRM is holding on Tuesday and Wednesday at a Washington hotel.The organizers, who dubbed the meeting the Keeping Families Together Summit, emphasized that it is being held just at the point where a total of two million deportations is close to being reached during the administration of Barack Obama.At the summit, leaders from different cities will discuss new strategies for the immigration movement, said Ricardo Ramirez in the name of FIRM, which is a national coalition of grassroots organizations fighting for immigrant rights at the local, state and federal levels.The Senate last June approved a comprehensive bill to reform the country's immigration system that includes strengthening security along the border with Mexico and opens the door to U.S. citizenship for undocumented foreigners residing in the United States.The lower house, which has a Republican majority, has refused to analyze in its entirety the document already approved by the Senate and prefers to break the immigration issue as a whole down into its component parts.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigrants, supporters rally across the US for Obama to halt immigrations PHOENIX –  Dozens of immigration advocates and supporters are rallying in cities across the country in a renewed effort to push President Barack Obama to put a freeze on deportations.Organizers of Saturday's "Day of Action" demonstrations say Obama has the executive power to stop deportations that separate immigrants living in the country illegally from their loved ones.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn Eloy, Ariz., numerous supporters have converged in front of a federal detention center after journeying more than 60 miles from Phoenix.Organizers say many of those present have relatives who have been inside the facility for more than a year.In March, Obama asked Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review enforcement practices to ease his administration's rate of deportations.Under Obama's leadership, almost 2 million people have been removed from the U.S. 
Immigration Advocate Deported To Mexico In 2007 Illegally Crosses U.S. Border, Asks For Sanctuary TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) –  A Mexican immigrant rights advocate who gained international attention when she took refuge in a Chicago church before being deported asked Tuesday for refuge in the United States on humanitarian grounds.Elvira Arellano crossed into the United States with her U.S.-born teenage and 4-year-old sons along with a group of Mexican and Central American migrants from the border city of Tijuana, many of them deported mothers with U.S.-born children."I am asking that they let me in the United States legally on humanitarian grounds, because I am a defender of human rights in Mexico and I've received kidnapping and violence threats," Arellano said before entering the U.S. "But more importantly, because they have separated my son from his chance to have a good upbringing."Arellano, 38, was deported to Mexico in 2007 after seeking sanctuary at a Chicago church for a year. She was deported without her son, who eventually reunited with her in Mexico.Organized by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, this was fourth such group to enter the U.S. at the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego in the last nine days, as part of protests to demand an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws and an end to deportations.The migrants have asked for asylum or visas on humanitarian grounds because they say they have been threatened by criminals or extorted by organized crime."I know I'm risking my freedom and being with my children because I could go to prison," Arellano said before crossing. "But I will fight to be with my children"After Arellano was deported to Tijuana, she founded a home for deported migrants and began speaking publicly about the complex reality of migrant families and how deportations are making their lives more difficult.President Barack "Obama has to stop the deportations and allow us to be with our families," she said.Unlike similar protests last year in Arizona and Texas, many of those crossing into California are not "dreamers" — young adults who came to the U.S. as children. Like Arellano, they are parents who are seeking to return to the U.S. without legal documents, accompanied by their U.S. citizen children.At least two families who have crossed as part of the protests were notified by U.S. authorities that the children would be turned over to a child welfare agency if they were unwilling or unable to immediately designate a responsible adult to take them.Javier Galvan, 38, said he got a call Sunday in Jacksonville, Florida, after his wife and two children crossed into the U.S. that he had 48 hours to pick up his 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son — both U.S. citizens —or they would be placed in child protective services. Their mother, Cecilia Cortes, was held separately in a detention center after claiming asylum. The family returned to Michoacan state in Mexico to visit an ailing relative in 2011."We were really surprised," said Galvan, who claimed asylum last year in the Texas protest and was released pending the outcome of his case. "The children need their mother."The children were picked up Monday at a shelter by a relative who drove from San Francisco.Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately respond to questions about the children with U.S. citizenship.An official at the Mexican consulate in San Diego who spoke on condition of anonymity because the cases are considered private confirmed that U.S. citizen children are being turned over to child welfare authorities. The official didn't know how many.Rocio Hernandez, an organizer for the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, said that 14 U.S. children had been separated from their parents and put in shelters before Sunday.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration: Border Patrol Agents Arrest More Than 200 Immigrants Hiding In Texas McALLEN, Texas (AP) — At least 80 immigrants suspected of entering the United States illegally were arrested in a makeshift encampment in suburban South Texas.They were found in an undeveloped patch of scrub near an abandoned tennis club in McAllen. They were camped under tents and huts camouflaged with mesquite branches and cacti. Some told authorities they had been there sleeping on pieces of cardboard with little food or water for at least a week.It was unclear whether any of those arrested Thursday afternoon were guides suspected of guarding the immigrants, Border Patrol spokesman Danny Tirado told The McAllen Monitor.A short time later, Border Patrol arrested 132 immigrants found in two buildings on a property in Alton, about 8 miles west of McAllen, according to KRGV-TV.The Border Patrol made more than 154,000 arrests on the section of the U.S.-Mexico border in southernmost Texas last year, more than anywhere else on the Southwest border. The majority of the immigrants come from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.Guides typically lead the immigrants across the Rio Grande in smaller groups and then mass them in so-called stash houses on the Texas side of the border until their transportation can be arranged for the next leg of their journey."We ate one burrito per day," said Alfredo Espinoza Rivera, who was arrested at the camp. He said he had left El Salvador about six weeks earlier, paying $7,000 to a smuggler. The 37-year-old said he was trying to reach his father, a U.S. citizen, in Los Angeles."I'm scared to go back to my country," he said. "There's a lot of crime and it's hard to live there."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration change gives legal status to undocumented relatives of US military  Immigration reform may be stalled in Congress, but a new Obama administration policy is extending legal status and military benefits to thousands of illegal immigrants who are the spouses, parents and children of American military members. Supporters say the policy -- which applies to active-duty military, reservists and veterans -- is long overdue. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"Those veterans and those men and women who serve in the National Guard certainly deserve the peace of mind that their family members will not be deported," immigration attorney Faye Kolly said. But critics say the policy is tantamount to backdoor amnesty. "A whole class of aliens with no right to be in the United States are suddenly going to be allowed to live and work here on the basis of their relationship with military and veterans," said Dan Cadman, with the Center for Immigration Studies. The exemption, called parole in place, came in the form of a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services "policy memorandum." It was not submitted to or approved by Congress, and the regulations were not published in the Federal Register, which allows for public comment prior to a rule taking effect. "I don't want to overstate it, but it sounds very similar to imperial decree if you ask me," Cadman said. "The public had no chance to comment on this new policy. I believe the way this was done was illegal." Obama administration officials say the new rules do not require congressional action because they're based on existing statutes. "It's clearly within the president's authority to enforce the law and choose which immigrants he thinks are the priority," said Brent Wilkes of the League of United Latin American Citizens. "These folks aren't threats. They've got a relative that's serving our nation." One face of this new policy is Christian Gonzalez, a retired Marine who has been recommended for a Purple Heart. He was attacked five days in a row by improvised explosive devices (IED's) in Afghanistan. The last one nearly claimed his life. "For a brief period, I was paralyzed from the waist down. I suffered a pretty traumatic brain injury from that," said the San Antonio resident, sitting alongside his wife Laura, who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child. "Without her, you know, I'd be lost with my disabilities. Critics only look at her as an illegal alien. They're not looking at her as the spouse of a veteran," he said. Christian and Laura met in middle school. He enlisted in the Marines during high school. They got married when he returned from multiple tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Under the new policy, tens of thousands of illegal aliens like Laura will be offered a green card and legal residency. As the wife of a veteran, she would be entitled to his health care, education and survivor benefits, as well as simple things like a Social Security number and driver's license. "I'm covered, my kids are covered, but the woman that runs the house, she's not covered. So that's probably the hardest part," Gonzalez said. "Now she'll be able to get a job, go to school. It would make her feel like she contributes more to the family."William La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based correspondent.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Immigration Detainees On Hunger Strike Threatened With Force Feeding, Attorney Claims SEATTLE (AP) –  An immigrant-rights attorney said Monday that detainees at the Northwest Detention Center in Washington state were being threatened with forced feeding if they continue their hunger strike. But federal officials say the step would have to be medically necessary and court-ordered.Attorney Sandy Restrepo said she spoke on Monday with three detainees who have been participating in the hunger strike, now in its fourth day. She said they told her they were pulled out for individual questioning and told they would be force-fed if they continued their strike."They were physically fatigued and tired, but emotionally they were doing great," Restrepo said, adding they told her they planned to continue refusing food.Hundreds of immigration detainees began the strike Friday. Under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rules, any detainee who doesn't eat for 72 hours will be referred for medical evaluation and possible treatment.ICE officials said Monday afternoon that medical personnel are taking steps to evaluate which detainees fall into that category. It wasn't clear yet how many detainees would be affected.An ICE official confirmed that detainees are being advised of the potential consequences of remaining on a hunger strike, including forced feeding."ICE fully respects the rights of all people to express their opinion without interference," ICE spokesman Andrew Munoz said in a statement. "While we continue to work with Congress to enact commonsense immigration reform, ICE is focused on sensible, effective immigration enforcement that focuses on convicted criminals, immigration fugitives and those apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States."ICE's hunger strike policy says officials won't force anyone to eat unless it's determined to be medically necessary and ordered by a court. ICE's policy is to seek a court order to obtain authorization for involuntary medical treatment, according to the document.Activists say the detainees are seeking better food and treatment, as well as better pay for detention center jobs. At one point, about 750 of the center's nearly 1,300 detainees refused to eat.ICE says about 130 people did not eat Monday lunch, though Restrepo and others believe the numbers are higher.Even though detainees have refused to eat scheduled meals, they have had access to food through the detention commissary, according to ICE."Due to the large number of participants, center staff are relying on self-declarations to decide which detainees require medical observation away from the general population," the agency said.Those placed under medical observation may not be declared to be on a hunger strike until it is certain they have not consumed food for 72 hours, ICE said.Activist Maru Mora-Villalpando said she and others have heard from detainees who report that they're being intimidated for participating. She said demonstrators plan to protest and rally outside the Tacoma facility Tuesday.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration push threatens to divide Republicans Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., center, accompanied by fellow GOP lawmakers, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 25, 2014, following a GOP caucus lunch.APIn the heat of an election year, the prospect of immigration legislation threatens to strike a divide into the Republican Party on Capitol Hill. House Speaker John Boehner is sending new signals that he's preparing to aggressively push for an immigration bill, even if it causes the rank-and-file headaches. But on the other side of the Hill, top Senate Republicans are picking a different fight -- going after the Obama administration over reported efforts to ease deportations. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn a letter sent Thursday to President Obama and signed by 22 Senate Republicans, they accused the administration of "an astonishing disregard for the Constitution." The reported deportation changes, they charged, would be a "near complete abandonment of basic immigration enforcement." The same day, Boehner was putting out a very different message in his home district in Ohio. During a talk to a local Rotary Club, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported, he mocked fellow Republicans for their resistance to an immigration bill. "Here's the attitude. Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard," Boehner said, according to the paper, pretending to whine as he talked. He added: "We get elected to make choices." This comes after he reportedly told a fundraiser crowd that he's "hell-bent on getting this done this year." Just a couple months ago, immigration seemed like a stalled debate for 2014. Boehner had backed off, citing concerns in the GOP rank-and-file about the administration's own allegedly lax enforcement policies. Despite Boehner's renewed interest, those concerns have mounted since then. The Department of Homeland Security is undergoing a review of its deportation policies under pressure from immigrant advocates. But Republicans have pointed out that those policies already spare millions from the threat of being removed. Statistics show that most of the 370,000 removals carried out in fiscal 2013 were people who had been caught crossing the border or convicted of a crime. The potential push to further rein in deportations prompted the letter Thursday from Senate Republicans -- including Boehner's counterpart, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. "Clearly, the urgent task facing your administration is to improve immigration enforcement, not to look for new ways to weaken it," they wrote. In a statement, Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard didn't respond to the senators' complaints but said, "The secretary has undergone a very rigorous and inclusive process to best inform the review." Many activists want sweeping action by Obama to give legal certainty and work permits to millions more immigrants, like he did for those who arrived illegally as children and attended school or served in the military. The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Immigration Reform Could Hinge On Quiet Handful Of Tea Party Conservatives Theyâre not the conservative faction that has been front and center in the opposition to giving undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status and stay and work in the United States.The toughest stumbling block to a comprehensive immigration reform agreement in the House of Representatives, The Hill reports, may well be a quiet group â a handful of Tea Party conservatives who arenât the kind of fixtures in front of the camera that other immigration hardliners, such as Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Rep. Louie Gomert of Texas, have been on the emotionally-charged issue.Those quiet critical few, The Hill said, include Reps. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), Trey Gowdy (S.C.), Justin Amash (Mich.), Renee Ellmers (N.C.) and Steve Scalise (La.).These lawmakers are likely to look to conservative peers â not lobby groups or the GOP establishment â for cues on how to move on the immigration issue, the publication said.House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has said he will push a measure if it gets a majority â or 117 â of the 233 members of the Republican conference.âAmerican Principles [Project, dedicated to promoting conservative policies] is going after Tea Party conservatives who are influencers. Their votes will influence other Tea Party members and at the end of the day that will make the difference with House Republicans,â said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, to The Hill.Immigration reform seemed on a roll last year as a bipartisan group in the Senate worked very publicly on a comprehensive measure that ultimately called for beefing up border security, expanding foreign work visa programs, and providing a path to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants.The Senate passed the bipartisan measure in June.But almost immediately conservatives in the House, where Republicans have a majority, vowed not to rubber-stamp the Senate measure.They said they would act on immigration in a piecemeal way. And some of the most conservative Republicans said they would not approve any measure that called for giving a break to people who had broken immigration laws.And so, efforts to pass an immigration measure in the House came to a halt.âLibertarians are more inclined to an open borders strategy,â said a GOP aide, who was not named in The Hill story.Some of the countryâs leading proponents who lobby for strict immigration enforcement concede that swaying lawmakers on immigration is a tough battle.âItâs very difficult to change the minds of 180 people or 100 people so you look to see who the peer leaders are in each class and also state delegations,â said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which supports reduced immigration. âWe certainly have anticipated the importance of keeping those kind of people on board.ââOur activists are hitting (N.C. Rep. Renee) Ellmers very hard after her comments this week. If any of these type of people show signs of giving in to the establishment, we do regard it as very important,â he added.Meanwhile, Republicans are said to be working on a set of âimmigration principlesâ that call for stricter enforcement as well as allowing some undocumented immigrants to earn a legal status.Some conservatives, including Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have strongly denounced the principles, though they have not been made public.Sessions reportedly held a meeting with staff members of some conservatives last week to strategize about how to handle the principles and other developments regarding immigration reform.He has warned that legalizing millions of immigrants and giving foreign nationals expanded opportunities to work in the United States will be detrimental to American workers.âIt would be tragic if the Leader's immigration principles were simply a âpiecemealâ repackaging of the Senate plan,â he said in a statement, The Hill reported.On Tuesday, President Barack Obama is expected to push again for congressional action on immigration reform in his State of the Union address.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration Reform Could Mean Higher Fees For Those Seeking Path Toward Citizenship EDINBURG, Texas (AP) –  Hilda Vasquez squirreled away the money for her U.S. citizenship application by selling batches of homemade tamales at South Texas offices. Carmen Zalazar picked up extra babysitting jobs at night after caring for kids all day in Houston.The women scrimped and saved for months to pay for the $680 application, but for other applicants in the future, it might not be enough.As President Barack Obama renews his quest for immigration reform, some proposals would impose fines of $2,000 on top of application fees, making the financial hurdles much taller for people who are here illegally."You have more rights when you are a citizen, like to vote," said Zalazar, a legal resident. As soon as she started a citizenship class, "I started to save because I knew otherwise it won't be possible."The struggle is familiar to millions of immigrants. A 2012 survey by the Pew Hispanic Center showed that only 46 percent of Hispanic immigrants eligible to become citizens had done so. The top two reasons were lack of English skills and lack of money to pay for the application.Manuel Enrique Angel made learning English his first priority upon arriving in Houston from his native El Salvador two years ago. He now speaks English clearly and deliberately and plans to apply for citizenship as soon as he becomes eligible later this year.Trained as a lawyer in El Salvador, the 28-year-old works as a cook in a Houston burger joint. His wife, an American citizen, is a hair stylist. He estimates it will take him up to eight months to save the money for the citizenship application."It's really hard when you have to pay rent around $600, when you have car notes for $300 and $500," Angel said.Republican supporters of the proposed fines say penalties are necessary to defend against any appearance that creating a pathway to citizenship amounts to amnesty.Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that supports tighter immigration controls, said if immigrants who are in the country illegally are allowed to seek citizenship, they should have to pay the costs, which will increase if millions of applications need to be processed.However, he said, the costs should not be so high that people can't afford them."It's stupid to price people out of the market," Krikorian said.Angel plans to take advantage of a program at a Houston credit union that offers small low-interest loans specifically to help clients become citizens. The Promise Credit Union partners with Neighborhood Centers Inc., a nonprofit network of community centers in the Houston area that cater to immigrants.Credit union President Randy Martinez said the program began as a pilot in 2012 and only officially started last fall."We don't want that to become an obstacle for them not to become citizens, just because they don't have the entire fee to pay," he said.The credit union's $455 loans include $380 toward the citizenship process plus a $75 processing fee for the loan application. They carry a fixed 5 percent interest rate for a 12-month term, so the monthly payments work out to about $38.Applicants must contribute $300 of their own money. They are all pre-screened by the Neighborhood Centers legal team to make sure they qualify for citizenship and have all the necessary documentation.The credit union has already discussed expanding the loans if Congress approves a reform package that offers people in the country illegally a costlier path to citizenship, Martinez said.An immigration reform bill passed by the Senate in June did not set the costs of the proposed 13-year path to citizenship. Lawmakers left that up to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with the idea that fees would make the system self-sustaining.While the fees remain unspecified, the Senate bill lays out penalties totaling $2,000 to be paid at various steps along the way. The legislation would create a new status called "registered provisional immigrant" and require anyone with that status to pay taxes.During the 13-year wait, immigrants would be "working on the books, and you will hopefully be able to make a better income and be progressing in your life," said Ellen Battistelli, a policy analyst with the National Immigration Law Center, who has argued against making the process too costly."There are so many requirements and financial burdens, this is a very rigorous path to go," especially for low-wage workers, Battistelli said.On Thursday, the House released its immigration-reform principles, which included no special path to citizenship for the 11 million people already in the U.S. illegally but would make those here illegally "pay significant fines and back taxes" to gain legal status.In an interview with CNN broadcast Friday, the president signaled that he may consider legislation that does not offer a path to citizenship — a noticeable shift from his previous position, which was that it "doesn't make sense" to leave that aspect of immigration unresolved.On Friday, Obama reiterated his preference for a concrete route to citizenship but said he doesn't want to "prejudge" what might land on his desk.Vasquez and Zalazar, both legal residents in their 50s, did not have to work in the shadows, and both took citizenship classes.During Zalazar's classs at the Baker-Ripley Community Center in Houston's diverse Gulfton neighborhood, teacher Crystal Gonzalez asked the class how much it cost to become a U.S. citizen. Several hands shot up."How many of you have $680 that you can spend tomorrow?" Gonzalez asked.No hands, just a few nervous giggles and rubbing of temples."We're already telling people to start saving money with regard to the reform," Gonzalez said later. "We don't want people to be held back because they don't have the money."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 

Immigration Reform Not The Only Legislation That Could Have Little Congressional Action In 2014 WASHINGTON (AP) –  Little more than a week after Groundhog Day, the evidence is mounting that lawmakers have all but wrapped up their most consequential work of 2014, at least until the results of the fall elections are known."We've got a lot of things on our plate," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said recently when asked what Congress will be busy with this year, but he predicted no breakthrough accomplishments on immigration, taxes or any other area."Why don't we just pack up and go home?" countered House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California after Boehner blamed President Barack Obama for lack of movement on immigration. "What we're supposed to do is legislate and not make up excuses as to why we don't."Immigration legislation is hardly the only area where inaction is the likeliest outcome.A Senate-passed bill has fallen into the congressional equivalent of a black hole in the House, where conservative critics cite a changing series of reasons for not wanting to take action.Initially, they said they didn't want to vote on a bill because they oppose amnesty for immigrants living in the country illegally. Then they observed it would be a political mistake to shift focus away from their own opposition to the health care law, which unites them, and turn it onto an issue that divides them. Most recently, Boehner, who has said repeatedly he wants to pass an immigration bill, has joined others in citing a lack of trust with Obama as a reason for inaction.If immigration legislation is moribund in the House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has made it clear he doesn't intend to seek passage of a second Obama priority, this one a bill to facilitate passage of trade deals with Europe and Asia."I'm against fast track," said the man who sets the Senate's agenda, referring to the measure Obama wants. "I think everyone would be well advised just to not push this right now."The legislation is opposed by large segments of organized labor, the very unions that Democrats will be counting on to pour money and manpower into their bid to hold control of the Senate in the November election.Republicans need to gain six seats to win a majority. They say they increasingly are bullish about their prospects, what with the country generally pessimistic about the future, Obama's favorability ratings well below the levels of his re-election campaign, and controversies afflicting the president's health law.While Reid hasn't said so, other lawmakers and aides speculate that trade could top the agenda of any postelection session of Congress.An overhaul of tax laws seems further off than it did a year ago. There was scant evidence of progress in 2013, and now a transition is occurring at the Senate Finance Committee, where Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has yet to announce his priorities as incoming chairman. He will succeed Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who was confirmed on Thursday as ambassador to China.Deficit reduction, the driving force of the tea party-heavy House majority, now occupies a back seat, and the projected deficit for the current budget year is the lowest since George W. Bush was in the White House.Nor do Republicans appear likely to compromise any time soon on an increase in the minimum wage or other items on Obama's agenda.The first bill the Democrats put on the Senate floor this year, to renew benefits for the long-term unemployed, is stalled by Republican opposition. Even an eventual compromise wouldn't be much to brag about. Congress has passed similar bills repeatedly in the wake of past economic downturns.Not that much of significance has been done up until now.With much fanfare, lawmakers recently completed work on a five-year farm bill — two years late.By month's end, lawmakers are virtually certain to raise the nation's debt limit. That, too, is a relatively routine measure, even if in recent years it has passed only after considerable brinkmanship.Another potential area for compromise is legislation to overhaul the system for reimbursing doctors who treat Medicare patients.The bipartisan supporters of a measure along those lines have yet to agree on how to offset the cost, though.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration Reform: Pessimism And Optimism Alike On Prospects For 2014 At first, it seemed 2007 was going to be the year marking the first time in a generation that the country was poised to systematically overhaul its national immigration system. But the effort went down in flames. Then it was widely expected that this year all stars were aligned.Again, no dice.So will immigration reform finally take place in 2014?Yes.No.Maybe.Those are the answers of political experts to the question that – like the end-of-the-year question about the future of the stock market, and the question about the verdict that a jury is likely to return – defies consensus.Some say they are optimistic that the flawed immigration system will see an overhaul, either in a comprehensive or piecemeal way, in 2014.Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, departed from commonly accepted thought arguing that immigration reform died with the lack of a vote in the House this year on a version of the bipartisan comprehensive measure the Senate passed in June.“Both Republicans and Democrats are moving toward a compromise in the House as we speak,” Nowrasteh told Fox News Latino. “Republicans need to give a little on legalizing unauthorized immigrants, and Democrats need to agree to more legal-worker immigration for the future.”Kica Matos, the director of the immigrant rights program at the Center for Community Change, an immigrant advocacy organization, said reform will happen next year because – if for no other reason – the movement pushing for it is too fired up and better organized than it’s ever been.“I recognize I am reading tea leaves,” Matos said. “But immigration reform is alive and well. I’m not just saying this out of desperation. The Republican leadership in the House has recognized that it has to move forward. [Rep. Bob] Goodlatte said it is a priority for 2014, [Rep. John] Boehner said he recognizes that immigration reform has to happen.”- Chris Pawelski, onion farmer and farming advocateTo be sure, many in Congress sounded similar tunes at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013 – after GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney’s crushing defeat, said by many to be partly rooted in his his hard-line position against any measure that would provide a path to legal status.Many Latinos said in voter polls in 2012 that Romney’s tough position, and that of the GOP in general during the primaries, fueled an alienation the community felt from Republicans. After President Barack Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote, many GOP leaders – including House Speaker Boehner, of Ohio – described it as a wake-up call, a motivator for the party to soften its stance on immigration and to make overtures to Latinos.But as 2013 wore on, the talk of a wake-up call grew softer, and the resistance by many conservative Republicans to what they see as rewarding law-breakers grew stronger, picking up more moderate members of the party along the way.What’s to say the firmness of some GOP leaders about immigration reform in 2014 won’t end up the same way as the year wears on?“It has to move forward in 2014,” Matos said, adding that advocacy groups pushing for a reform that will include a path to legal status will not let up on their increasingly provocative acts of disobedience, and others forms of pressure.These were some of the actions taken the last 365 days: Activists blocked immigration buses carrying immigrants slated for deportation. They held sit-ins in congressional offices. They fasted by the hundreds across the nation, some going without food for some three weeks – the largest group was staging their hunger strike in tents around the National Mall. They cornered Boehner while he was having breakfast alone at the counter of a diner in Washington D.C. And more than 100 activists held a vigil outside Boehner’s home just before Thanksgiving.“Nearly 200 people visited congressional offices” on a recent day, Matos said. “What will be different in 2014? A game changer is the militancy of this movement. We weren’t doing acts of civil disobedience a year ago, we are winning in terms of legislation at the state levels, our movement has become more sophisticated and stronger over time.”Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who is a leading voice in Congress for comprehensive immigration reform, told reporters recently that next year will be the last chance in the foreseeable future for the passage of legislation. After that, he said, there will be a new Congress (in 2015) decidedly less inclined to take up the issue.His fellow Democrat, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, told reporters last week that Boehner had told her that the House would take up immigration reform in 2014.“He told me yes, we have to wait until next year,” she was quoted as saying in Politico.Republicans in the House, where they have the majority, have resisted bills that would extend a path to legal status to undocumented immigrants and bring in more workers, which they say would create competition for jobs at a time when many Americans are out of work.The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure in June that, among other things, tightens security along the border, steps up interior enforcement, expands foreign worker visas and provides opportunities for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria to legalize their status.The immigration reform effort, however, stalled in the House. Boehner and other Republicans said if they did move on immigration, they would not rubber-stamp the Senate bill. Instead, they said, they would tackle the issue in a series of measures dealing with different aspects of immigration.Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who was part of the bipartisan group in that chamber that drafted the comprehensive measure, said in recent days that his party would be more willing to take up the issue again after the primaries in 2014.“I think conventional wisdom is that time is not on our side,” McCain was quoted as saying in published reports. “But there are a number of members of Congress who have primaries and when those primaries are done, they may be more inclined to address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform.”Others think the elections in 2014 may be a reason political leaders and candidates stay away from immigration.“Repeating the amnesty of 1986 is Republican party suicide,” said D.A. King, a Georgia-based, nationally known activist who fights state-level and national efforts to provide breaks to undocumented immigrants.“Pew [research institute] says that illegal Latinos would vote nearly 8-1 for big-government Democrats if they were legalized.”King, leader of the Dustin Inman Society, which pushes for tighter immigration enforcement, has designed and financed bumper stickers and billboards in Georgia taking aim at Republicans he sees as sell-outs for backing a path to legal status.“The smart money is on pro-enforcement Americans defeating another amnesty and attempt to double immigration in 2014,” he said. “For the same reasons we beat back the billion and a half dollar lobbying effort from the LearJet crowd this year and 2006 and 2007.”Jan Ting, who was second in charge of the country's immigration system in the early 1990s, said Republicans have their sights set on winning back a majority in the Senate in 2014 – a goal that could be in jeopardy if they touch the hot-potato issue of immigration.“I don’t think anything is going to happen,” said Ting, who now teaches immigration law at Temple University in Philadelphia.“In a year of closely contested congressional nationwide elections, the leaders of the Republican party would not want to put their members on the spot. No matter how they vote, it will lose them votes.”For his part, Chris Pawelski, a fourth-generation upstate New York onion farmer who lobbies for farming legislation, hopes reform happens because, he said, the country has a serious agricultural labor shortage.“If nothing happens in 2014, more of the same will continue,” he said. “In agriculture, you will continue to see a farm labor shortage. Over the past few seasons on my farm and neighboring farms we have had a hard time finding workers. Many of us have had a partial work force though most of the season.”Many undocumented workers, he said, would be willing to work in the United States, pay taxes, but keep their native homeland as their primary residence.“The reality,” Pawelski said, is “that the vast number of undocumented persons in this country, over 11 million, need to be either legalized or documented. You cannot simply deport 11 million persons.” Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration Reform Would Reduce Deficit By $900B In 20 Years, Says Federal Agency The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported Tuesday that the immigration form plan presented by Democrats in the House of Representatives would reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $900 billion over the next 20 years.The CBO estimates that approving the bill - virtually identical to the bipartisan measure passed by the Senate last June - would save the country about $200 billion in the first decade and some $700 billion in the second.That forecast assumes that the legislation would increase the population by some 10 million people in more than a decade, adding another 8 million undocumented immigrants whose status would be legalized.The CBO report "proves that now is truly the time to pass comprehensive immigration reform," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement."With this sensible, bipartisan legislation, we can raise wages, empower our small businesses, spur innovation and create jobs. We can bring our broken immigration system into line with our history and our values - securing our borders, protecting our workers, uniting our families, and creating an earned pathway to citizenship," the California Democrat said.Pelosi lamented the fact that "despite the enormous (economic) benefits" and the "overwhelming support" of the U.S. population for the reform, Republicans continue to block a vote on comprehensive immigration reform."Enough is enough - and Democrats are demanding a vote," Pelosi said."It is time for Republicans to stop catering to the most extreme, anti-immigrant wing of their caucus, and allow a vote on the bipartisan immigration reform our nation so urgently needs," she concluded. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Immigration Rules Eased For People Who Provided 'Limited' Support To Terrorists WASHINGTON (AP) –  The Obama administration has eased the rules for would-be asylum-seekers, refugees and others who hope to come to the United States or stay here and who gave "limited" support to terrorists or terrorist groups.The change is one of President Barack Obama's first actions on immigration since he pledged during his State of the Union address last month to use more executive directives.The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department now say that people considered to have provided "limited material support" to terrorists or terrorist groups are no longer automatically barred from the United States.- Morteza AssadiA post-Sept. 11 provision in immigrant law, known as terrorism related inadmissibility grounds, had affected anyone considered to have given support. With little exception, the provision has been applied rigidly to those trying to enter the U.S. and those already here but wanting to change their immigration status.For Morteza Assadi, a 49-year-old real estate agent in northern Virginia, the law has left him in a sort of immigration purgatory while his green card application has been on hold for more than a decade.As a teenager in Tehran, Iran, in the early 1980s, Assadi distributed fliers for a mujahedeen group that opposed the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the U.S. government at one time considered a terrorist organization. Assadi said he told the U.S. government about his activities when he and his wife applied for asylum in the late 1990s. Those requests were later granted and his wife has since become a U.S. citizen. But Assadi's case has remained stalled."When we are teenagers, we have different mindsets," Assadi said. "I thought, I'm doing my country a favor."Assadi said he only briefly associated with the group, which was removed from Washington's list of terrorist organizations in 2012, and that he was never an active member or contributor to its activities. Now he's hopeful that the U.S. government will look at his teenage activities as "limited."His lawyer, Parastoo Zahedi, said she has filed a lawsuit in federal court to force U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process Assadi's green card application but now hopes the government will act on its own."In the past, the minute your name was associated with a (terrorist) organization you were being punished," Zahedi said. "Not every act is a terrorist act, and you can't just lump everyone together."The Homeland Security Department said in a statement that the rule change, which was announced last week and not made in concert with Congress, gives the government more discretion but won't open the country to terrorists or their sympathizers. People seeking refugee status, asylum and visas, including those already in the United States, still will be checked to make sure they don't pose a threat to national security or public safety, the department said.In the past, the provision has been criticized for allowing few exemptions beyond providing medical care or acting under duress. The change now allows officials to consider whether the support was not only limited but potentially part of "routine commercial transactions or routine social transactions.""Refugee applicants are subject to more security checks than any other category of traveler to the United States," Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard said. "Nothing in these exemptions changes the rigorous, multilayered security screening we do."The change does not specifically address "freedom fighters" who may have fought against an established government, including members of rebel groups who have led revolts in Arab Spring uprisings.In late 2011, Citizenship and Immigration Services said about 4,400 affected cases were on hold as the government reviewed possible exemptions to the rule. It's unclear how many of those cases are still pending.Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the rule change will help people he described as deserving refugees and asylum-seekers."The existing interpretation was so broad as to be unworkable," Leahy, D-Vt., said in a statement. He said the previous rule barred applicants for reasons "that no rational person would consider."Republican lawmakers argued that the administration is relaxing rules designed by Congress to protect the country from terrorists.Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called the change naive given today's global terrorist threats."President Obama should be protecting U.S. citizens rather than taking a chance on those who are aiding and abetting terrorist activity and putting Americans at greater risk," said Goodlatte, R-Va.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
In 2014, Immigration Reform Must Be A Priority For the past year, people from across the country have come to see firsthand how dysfunctional Washington can come to be: Republicans forcing a government shutdown, failure to expand unemployment benefits for millions of Americans, and the their obsession with repealing Obamacare.But despite all of the partisanship that consumes Washington on a daily basis, recent signals from the Republican leadership have indicated a possibility that their party might be ready to embrace immigration reform and pass a bill through Congress.- Jose AristimunoSpeaker of the House, John Boehner, recently hired Rebecca Tallen, a longtime immigration adviser to Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has supported immigration reform in the past, to head his immigration efforts.In addition, recent conversations and meetings within the Republican leadership have indicated that their party is looking to release an immigration blueprint that will highlight a series of principles that the leadership hopes to see on a potential immigration bill.Releasing a set of principles is a good start but far from where we need to be. For months, Republicans have expressed interest in presenting a set of bills to solve the issue of immigration on a step-by-step process. And as time goes by, there’s one question that the American people keep on asking: Where are the bills?President Obama has already expressed interest in a “piece-meal approach”, as long as all aspects of immigration are resolved. Regardless whether immigration reform is done in a comprehensive matter or in a piece-by-piece approach, immigration reform needs to happen.As always, there will be the two extremes: Republicans will call out amnesty, or some Democrats will walk away if a path to citizenship isn’t a part of the Republican’s idea of a bill. At the end of the day, both parties will have to sacrifice to see a bill get through the House of Representatives.One way of doing this, where both parties could potentially agree, is easing the current legal channels. Speeding up the process for companies to sponsor their employees for a green card and allowing students to be given a green card if they graduate from a U.S. high school or university would put them on a path to legal status.Regardless of how we do this, Republicans need to act. If they fail to do so, not only will they be politically vulnerable for the upcoming midterm elections, but they won’t have a realistic chance of being competitive in 2016.With almost 30 years since our immigration system was last reformed, now more than ever it’s time for Washington to put their differences aside, acknowledge that each side will have to give something up, and reform our immigration system once and for all.Jose Aristimuno is the founder of Latino Giant, a digital platform focused on empowering U.S. Latinos to reach their greatest potential. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Conscientious Objector Initially Denied U.S. Citizenship Is Now An American Immigration officials have reversed their decision to deny U.S. citizenship to a Colombian woman who refused to sign a pledge to bear arms, in defense of the United States, on her naturalization application.Adriana Ramirez, who lives in California and obtained permanent legal status in 2008, applied for U.S. citizenship late last year and expressed an objection to the part that asks about the willingness to bear arms to defend the country.The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service rejected the application, saying that objecting to bearing arms was allowed only when based on “religious training and belief.”Ramirez, who characterized herself in her explanation to USCIS as an atheist, said her objection was based on personal convictions.Ramirez wrote that while she could just have checked yes and “sealed the envelope,” she preferred to be truthful and say that bearing arms would go against her principles.“Checking ‘yes’ on Q36-38 would be a betrayal of everything I have stood for from a very early age,” Ramirez said. “I have strong and sincere moral convictions against arms and killing people.”She added, “I co-founded a journal focusing on non-violence, and have worked ever since to build the foundations of peace. If I were to sign the oath as it is, I would be withholding important information about who I am, only for the benefits of citizenship. . . . Therefore, I prefer to truthfully present my moral objection to this portion of the oath.”The American Humanist Association, a national non-profit group to which Ramirez turned for help after the denial of her application, wrote to the San Diego office of the USCIS to challenge the decision.“Because her conscientious objector claim is based on secular rather than theistic moral views, her application was denied,” said the AHA letter. “This denial is unconstitutional.”The organization argued that the U.S. Constitution protects the right to secular moral beliefs.Monica Miller, an attorney with AHA, told Fox News Latino that Ramirez, who could not be reached for comment, received a letter from USCIS about a week ago telling her to show up for her citizenship ceremony this week.“It could have been oversight” by the agency, Miller said, “but it was unconstitutional.”USCIS spokeswoman Joanne M. Ferreira said the agency could not comment on Ramirez’s case because of privacy laws.Miller said that AHA successfully challenged a similar case last year involving a Texas woman.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Independence talk could boomerang on separatist party in Quebec elections MONTREAL –  Quebec voters will elect a new government Monday following a tumultuous campaign that revived the debate on whether the French-speaking province should break away from Canada.That possibility now seems far off, with the pro-independence Party Quebecois facing a backlash over the renewed talk of independence, an idea that has enjoyed little support in recent years.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTQuebec Premier Pauline Marois, who has led a minority government since September 2012, called the snap National Assembly elections last month in the hopes of securing a majority needed to pass the PQ's controversial "charter of values," which would ban public employees from wearing religious headgear, including Muslim headscarves and Jewish skullcaps.Marois had tried to mute talk of another referendum on independence. But the strategy backfired early in the campaign when one PQ candidate, multi-millionaire media baron Pierre Karl Peladeau, burst onto the scene with a fist-pumping declaration of his commitment to "make Quebec a country."That turned independence into the defining issue of the campaign, sidelining the "charter of values" that the PQ had hoped would electrify French-speaking voters in crucial swing regions.Now, political experts see the PQ struggling to take control of the 125-seat legislature. Instead, the election has offered the Quebec Liberals — staunch supporters of Canadian unity — a shot at winning a majority just 18 months after provincial voters booted them from power for the first time in nine years."The campaign went off the rails with the Peladeau announcement and then it has just been a matter of desperately throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks, and finding that everything has instead bounced back at them," said Daniel Weinstock, a law professor at Montreal-based McGill University.One political cartoon summed up the dynamic: On a line graph measuring voter preference, the image of Peladeau's raised right fist directly corresponded with a drop in PQ support.Jean-Guy Perreault, a longtime PQ voter, is among those who were turned off by Peladeau's gesture."I thought that went too far," the 56-year-old businessman said while on his lunch break in Montreal's bustling financial district. "I usually vote PQ but I don't want independence." He has decided to vote for the smaller Coalition for Quebec's Future party, which promises to set aside the sovereignty debate to focus on the province's struggling economy.The Liberals remain haunted by allegations of corruption that tainted their nine years in power. But party leader Philippe Couillard, who opposes the charter of values, hammered away at the referendum issue and framed the election as a choice between uncertainty and stability."The choice is clear," Couillard said during one televised debate. "Do you want to elect the Parti Quebecois, which will prepare another referendum, or a Liberal government that will attend to the economy, jobs, education and health?"Quebec has had two referendums on sovereignty. The last such vote, in 1995, narrowly rejected independence.Michel Ducharme, a Quebec history professor at the University of British Columbia, said the campaign has proven that support for an independent Quebec remains stuck at low levels."What we have learned over the course of this campaign is that support is still the same, and that's not enough to win an election," Ducharme said.Quebec, which is 80 percent French-speaking, has plenty of autonomy already. The province of 8.1 million sets its own income tax, has its own immigration policy favoring French speakers, and has legislation prioritizing French over English.But many Quebecois have long dreamed of an independent Quebec, as they at times haven't felt respected and have worried about the survival of their language in English-speaking North America.Still, if the PQ gets anything less than a majority on Monday, political analysts expect a shake-up within the party.In Weinstock's view, Marois will likely be out as leader and the charter of values will recede into the background.One PQ supporter said she's disappointed with the way the election campaign has played out and feels the case for the charter has been misrepresented by its critics."I think we need it to ensure the separation of church and state — in hospitals, in schools, and in our government," said Lucie Jobin, a Montrealer who heads a Quebec organization promoting secularism.Jobin took part in a rally in favor of the charter on Saturday in Montreal. Protests have also been held against the charter, drawing thousands of Muslims, Jews and Sikhs. 
Indignant Congress says no to Iran's ambassador pick, unanimously backs measure barring entry WASHINGTON –  Congress said no way to Iran's choice for ambassador to the United Nations, outraged by the prospect of a member of a group responsible for the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran stepping on U.S. soil. The move forces President Barack Obama to make a decision with serious diplomatic repercussions.In a rare unanimous vote on Thursday, the House backed a bill that would bar entry to the U.S. to an individual found to be engaged in espionage, terrorism or a threat to national security. The vote came four days after similar action in the Senate and sends the bill to the White House.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe Obama administration opposes the selection of Hamid Aboutalebi because of his alleged participation in a Muslim student group that held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in the 1979 takeover. American officials have told Iran that Aboutalebi is unacceptable, and the State Department indicated Thursday that the issue could be resolved if Tehran simply withdrew the nomination.Iran has called U.S. rejection of Aboutalebi "not acceptable," with Iranian state television quoting Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham saying Aboutalebi is one of the country's best diplomats and argued that he previously received a U.S. visa. Aboutalebi has insisted his involvement in the group Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line was limited to translation and negotiation.Against the backdrop of ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the West, the latest flare-up has drawn attention in Iran, where the front-page headline of the Etemad newspaper blared, "Dispute over Iran's Ambassador," and "Our ambassador has been chosen and won't be changed."In practical terms, Obama must decide whether to sign or veto legislation that could upset host country agreements with numerous nations. Hours after the House vote, White House officials declined to say what the president would do. Spokesman Jay Carney said the administration was continuing to tell Iran that its choice was unacceptable.Proponents of the legislation said Obama's choice is clear."When Iran said they wanted to send someone to New York City, to the United Nations under diplomatic immunity, who is affiliated with those who captured our embassy and held them for 444 days, something's wrong there and everyone realizes that," Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., who sponsored the bill in the House, said in an interview.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took the lead on the measure, sponsoring it in the Senate and securing the support of Democrats and Republicans. Cruz had called the nomination "a deliberate and unambiguous insult to the United States."The overwhelming reaction and swift action on the bill reflect congressional suspicion about the administration's outreach to Iran and the nuclear talks. Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly warned the administration about possible concessions to Iran.Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., said Iran's choice of ambassador wasn't surprising because Tehran's "primary motive is showing contempt for the United States. Congress has unanimously approved legislation that sends the message to Tehran: 'Application Denied.'"The bill would impose a blanket prohibition to "deny admission to the United States to any representative to the United Nations who has engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses a threat to United States national security interests, or has engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States."Denying visas to U.N. ambassadorial nominees or to foreign heads of state who want to attend United Nations events in the United States is rare, if not unprecedented.In past, problematic cases — such as with a previous Iranian nominee in the early 1990s and more recently with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir — the U.S. has either signaled opposition to the applicant and the request has been withdrawn, or the State Department has simply declined to process the application. Those options, as well as approving or denying the application, are available in the current case.U.S. immigration law allows broad rejection of visas to foreigners and, in many cases, authorities do not have to give an explicit reason for why other than to deem the applicant a threat to national security or American policy.The law bars foreigners whose entry or activity in the U.S. would "have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States."It also bars people who have engaged in terrorist activity, which the law defines as including seizing and detaining others; threatening to kill, injure or continue to detain them; and violent attacks on internationally protected persons such as diplomats and other agents of the U.S. government.___Associated Press writers Julie Pace, Matthew Lee and Lara Jakes in Washington and Lee Keath in Cairo contributed to this report. 
Long Shot, But House Democrats Try To Force Vote On Comprehensive Immigration Reform WASHINGTON (AP) –  House Democrats deployed a little-used legislative move Wednesday to force a vote on a comprehensive immigration bill, an effort doomed to fail but designed to increase the election-year pressure on Republicans to act."It is time for us to have a vote," said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., who joined with dozens of Democrats, advocates and actress America Ferrera to mark 273 days since the Senate passed a bipartisan bill. They insisted that House Republican leaders act.Standing on the east steps of the Capitol in a light snow and biting wind, proponents argued that they had the necessary votes in the House for a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and tighten border security."We're tired of the House of Representatives leaders and their refusal to act," Ferrera said.Democrats introduced a discharge petition that requires the signature of 218 for legislative action, an effort that stands little chance of success as Republicans, even those supportive of immigration legislation, are unwilling to defy their leadership. Democrats hold 199 seats in the House and would need dozens of GOP supporters.The GOP is reluctant to vote on the divisive issue in an election year, especially with all signs pointing to major gains for Republicans in the November midterms.After months of conciliatory talk, President Barack Obama issued a statement praising the Democratic effort and chastising the Republicans."Immigration reform is the right thing to do for our economy, our security and our future," Obama said. "A vast majority of the American people agree. The only thing standing in the way is the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress to catch up with the rest of the country."The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June, but the measure has stalled in the GOP-controlled House where Republicans have argued for a piecemeal approach to reforming the system. That effort has gone nowhere as bills approved by the Judiciary Committee last summer have languished.Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other GOP leaders unveiled a set of immigration principles in January, but rank-and-file members balked at moving ahead on any legislation. Boehner attributed the GOP roadblock to a collective distrust of Obama to enforce any new laws.Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, dismissed the Democratic procedural move, pointing to Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's admission earlier this month that they wouldn't get the necessary 218 votes.Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who helped craft the Senate bill, said he understands that "people are under political constraints, but those who believe in immigration reform but refuse to sign the petition have an obligation to propose a viable alternative that gets an immigration bill signed into law."The reluctance among House Republicans comes despite business groups, unions, religious leaders and other activists banding together to push for immigration legislation. National Republicans also have argued that failure to act this year could cost the GOP politically in presidential elections.Opposition remains strong among some in the GOP who see the legislation as amnesty and detrimental to U.S. workers."Incredibly, House Democrats have unified behind an immigration bill that would double the inflow of new guest workers competing against jobless Americans in every single U.S. occupation - from engineering to teaching to manufacturing," said Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Budget Committee.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Iowa Rep. King blasts Mark Zuckerberg over attack ads  Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, blasted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Monday over attack ads that criticize the congressman's resistance to immigration legislation."He's going to tap into his multibillions in order to try to muzzle me, as I understand this, because Zuckerberg and some of his minions have decided that I stand in the way of amnesty," King told FoxNews.com's Mallory Factor. "I can't imagine Zuckerberg having a lot of interest about the tens of millions who are here illegally except that he wants to have a supply of cheap labor for his technology companies." ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe TV and digital ad campaign will be launched by FWD.us, a Zuckerberg-backed pro-immigration group, and aired throughout Iowa's Fourth Congressional District."You would think a fellow from California wouldn't be that interested in what's going on in the Fourth Congressional District in Iowa," King said. "He won't miss the money he spends there, I doubt if he'll notice it's gone."King was the target of attack ads during the last election."Here I am, still in the center of the bull's eye. They spent $7.5 million last time ... far more money than ever been spent before in a congressional race in Iowa," King said. "If Zuckerberg is behind this, and he is, and that's the announcement, there's not going to be a limit to the amount of money that they can spend in Iowa." In the interview, King also discussed 2016 presidential politics in his state -- and touted that all 16 candidates he backed for the state Central Committee won at recent district conventions. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Iran protests US visa denial for UN ambassador pick  Iran is pushing back against the Obama administration's decision to deny a visa to its choice for U.N. ambassador, describing the move as a dangerous precedent and requesting a special meeting of a U.N. committee to discuss the matter.The Obama administration said Friday that the U.S. had notified Iran it would not grant a visa allowing Hamid Aboutalebi to enter the country over concerns about his involvement in the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis in Tehran.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIran's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Hossein Dehghani on Monday sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requesting that the denial be addressed in an "extraordinary and urgent manner" by the U.N. Committee on Relations with the Host Country. "This decision of the U.S. government has indeed negative implications for multilateral diplomacy and will create a dangerous precedence and affect adversely the work of intergovernmental organizations and activities of their member states," Dehghani wrote.Cyprus U.N. Ambassador Nicholas Emiliou, who chairs the 19-member committee that handles immigration and security for diplomats, told Reuters that a meeting would likely be held next week. "They have specified that they do not request any action on the part of the committee. They simply wish to brief us for the time being at least," Emiliou said of Iran's request.  Dehghani added that the "denial of visa to a representative of a U.N. member state is in contravention of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter including the principles of sovereign equality of states and respect for their sovereignty and political independence." Aboutalebi is alleged to have participated in a Muslim student group that held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days during the embassy takeover. He has insisted his involvement in the group Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line was limited to translation and negotiation. Iran says he is one of the country's best diplomats, and that he previously received a U.S. visa. He already served at Iranian diplomatic missions in Australia, Belgium and Italy.  As host country for the U.N., the U.S. must allow persons invited to the New York headquarters to enter the country. However, exceptions can be made when a visa applicant is found to have engaged in spying against the U.S. or poses a threat.On Saturday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country had no plans to name a new diplomat to the United Nations. He was quoted by Iran's semiofficial Mehr news agency as saying officials would pursue the issue "through anticipated legal channels at the U.N."Denying visas to U.N. ambassadorial nominees or to foreign heads of state who want to attend United Nations events in the U.S. is extremely rare, though there appears to be precedent. According to a paper published by the Yale Law School, the U.S. rejected several Iranians appointed to the U.N. in the 1980s who had played roles in the embassy hostage crisis or other acts against American citizens. But after more than three decades of discord, U.S. and Iranian officials have started having occasional direct contact, including a phone call last fall between Obama and new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. The U.S. and its international partners also have reached an interim agreement with Iran to halt progress on Tehran's disputed nuclear program.  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday that talks about Iran's nuclear program are continuing undisturbed by Washington's decision to block Aboutalebi. Officials are in the midst of negotiating a long-term agreement. Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel and The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
IRS, other federal agencies reportedly used license plate-tracking technology Automatic license plate readers like the one seen here are mounted atop a police cruiser and utilize both an infrared and a color camera. (Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department)The Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies reportedly awarded contracts to a license plate-tracking company to provide access to license-plate recognition databases or technology used to collect plate information. Bloomberg News reported that the IRS and other government agencies awarded about $415,000 in contracts to Livermore, Calif.-based Vigilant Solutions before the Department of Homeland Security dropped a plan for similar work after privacy concerns were raised.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn June 2012, the IRS awarded Vigilant a $1,188 contract for "access to nationwide data," according to federal procurement records compiled by the news agency. The contract ended in May 2013, according to the records.  "The IRS uses a variety of investigative tools similar to other law-enforcement agencies to assist with criminal cases," Eric Smith, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg, declining to say how the IRS used the records in its investigations. The Air Force’s Air Combat Command awarded the company a contract for license plate readers valued at as much as $114,000 in 2011, the report said. A command spokesman said the readers help make base access "easier and more secure."Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Forest Service awarded Vigilant a contract valued at about $47,019 for a product that scans and captures license plate numbers and compares the data collected to police databases of wanted vehicles.The Forest Service also awarded the company a contract valued at as much as $7,500 last year for a subscription to its license plate database and other services, according to federal contracting records obtained by Bloomberg. The Justice Department’s Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, DHS and U.S. Marshals Service have also awarded contracts to Vigilant for access to its records or tracking tools, according to the report.License plate readers – essentially cameras that snap rapid-fire pictures of license plates and vehicles as they pass – are in use in a host of locations, by private companies and law enforcement. The readers – whether they are mounted to police cars, traffic lights or toll booths – record the date, time and location of the vehicle when the picture was taken.Law enforcement has been using license plate readers for several years, but privacy advocates have raised concerns that the unchecked collection of such information could allow for the tracking of an average citizen’s every movement. In February, Homeland Security officials dropped plans to establish a national license-plate recognition database to collect information from commercial and law enforcement tag readers after concerns were raised over privacy and how the data would be scrutinized.The contract proposal said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning to use the license plate data in pursuit of criminal immigrants and others sought by authorities.According to the proposal, the government wanted “a close-up of the plate and a zoomed out image of the vehicle" and instant and around-the-clock access to records through a smartphone app. In 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the collection of license plate scanner data and warned that millions of records were being collected with little or no safeguards for people’s privacy.  Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the San Francisco-based civil liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Bloomberg the contracts represented privacy concerns."Especially with the IRS, I don’t know why these agencies are getting access to this kind of information," Lynch said. "These systems treat every single person in an area as if they’re under investigation for a crime -- that is not the way our criminal justice system was set up or the way things work in a democratic society." The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click here for more from Bloomberg.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Is 2014 The Year For Immigration Reform? Republicans, Chamber of Commerce Spar Conservatives and the nation's biggest business lobby sparred Wednesday over immigration overhaul, with advocates vowing a renewed effort to get the House to act this year and opponents digging in against anything that shifts the political spotlight from President Barack Obama's troubled health care law.The latest skirmish came as proponents raised expectations of congressional action on the contentious issue, seizing on any glimmer of positive developments. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door session that he would soon outline party principles on the issue, which could serve as a precursor to legislation.One of the GOP's crucial backers on many policies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, promised to "pull out all the stops" to get legislation done.- Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a chief foe of comprehensive immigration overhaul."We're determined to make 2014 the year that immigration reform is finally enacted," Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said in his State of American Business address. He said the organization would engage in grassroots lobbying, communications and partnership with unions, similar to what it did to secure a bipartisan bill in the Senate last year.Later, in a news conference, Donohue said the chamber had received a "very positive response" in the House on immigration.Opposition remains steadfast in the House, with several Republicans unwilling to give Obama one of his top second-term priorities.More than a dozen conservative House Republicans on Wednesday signed a letter to Obama arguing that the immigration overhaul he supports would increase the number of guest workers and give work permits and permanent residency to 30 million immigrants over the next 10 years, forcing a reduction in wages and hurting American workers."So-called comprehensive immigration reform may be a good deal for big businesses who want to reduce labor costs, and it may be a good deal for progressive labor unions seeking new workers from abroad, but it's an awful deal for U.S. workers - including African-American and Hispanic communities enduring chronically high unemployment," the letter states. It was spearheaded by Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala.Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a chief foe of comprehensive immigration overhaul, said the issue would divide the GOP caucus and shift the focus from what he called the "calamity" of the health care law.Republicans sense an election-year lift in the problem-plagued roll-out of the health care law, highlighting reports of canceled policies, higher premiums and other troubles. Republicans are looking to tighten their grip on the House and seize control of the Senate in November's midterm elections."It would be a colossal mistake for us to take up anything that just ends up changing the subject and getting it off Obamacare and splitting the Republican Party," King said after the closed-door session.King said Obama and the Democrats "want to debate immigration, they want to debate unemployment, they want to debate minimum wage," and Republicans should be wary of any diversion from health care.The Senate last year passed a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that addressed border security, provided enforcement measures and offered a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. House leaders, pressed by Tea Party conservatives, demanded a more limited and piecemeal approach.The House Judiciary Committee has approved smaller bills, but they have languished since the summer despite intense pressure from a diverse coalition of religious groups, business led by the Chamber of Commerce, labor unions and immigration advocates.Although House Republican leaders say they want to resolve the issue, which has become a political drag for the GOP, many rank-and-file Republicans have shown little inclination to deal with immigration. Many argue that a path to citizenship for those here illegally amounts to amnesty.A House Republican retreat later this month could help GOP leaders devise a strategy. Some Republicans and Democrats say Boehner may be waiting until after the filing deadlines for 2014 primary elections, thus protecting some incumbents from Tea Party or other conservative challenges. That would mean no meaningful votes until after April.Based on reporting by the Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Is Boehner heading for the exits? March 26, 2014: House Speaker John Boehner speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.APThe reading of political tea leaves is one of Washington's most popular parlor games.And when it comes to the future of House Speaker John Boehner, political soothsayers are busy divining patterns in tea leaves, wine sediments and coffee grounds to determine whether the Ohio Republican will stick around for another term. Questions are rampant as to whether Boehner could decide to leave on his own accord or be shoved out the door by a cabal of upstart conservatives intent to flip the House of Representatives on its ear.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThis tasseography involving the speaker's gavel takes on many forms. The Capitol Hill clairvoyants interpreted the following events as harbingers that Boehner is sure to soon hang it up:In December, the Ohio Republican took the rare step of blistering conservative advocacy groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Foundation. Those organizations routinely pelt Republican offices with messages about how to vote on key issues. And Boehner had enough."Frankly, I just think they have lost all credibility," Boehner said. "I don't care what they do."In particular, Boehner chastised the groups for driving conservatives to shutter the government unless they defunded the Affordable Care Act.  Boehner said those same advocates later conceded they didn't think their approach would work."Are you kidding me?" Boehner vented. "I think they're pushing our members into places they don't want to be."In February, Boehner purchased a condo in Marco Island, Fla., for $835,000. At the time, Boehner spokesman Mike Steel noted that "this area of Florida has been the Boehners' family vacation spot for many years, and rather than continue to put money into vacation rentals year after year, they decided to buy a condo."Naturally, prognosticators saw the purchase as a sure sign Boehner was prepared to retire to spend his time golfing in the Florida sunshine.There was the spate of retirement announcements. Boehner acolytes like Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-Calif., and, perhaps the speaker's best friend in the House, Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, all announced they were cashing it in at the end of this Congress.Surely Boehner wouldn't want to remain in Congress without those confidants, whispered the oracles.But there was more.In late March, there was the sudden retirement announcement of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich. Rogers had taken a pass on the Michigan Senate contest after longtime Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., announced his intention to step aside. One of the arguments for Rogers remaining in the House was that he wanted to continue his stewardship of the Intelligence panel. House Republican Conference rules dictate six-year term limits for committee chairs and ranking members. Rogers was only halfway into his six-year term and perhaps didn't want to give it up.Until Rogers declared he would depart Congress in January with two years remaining on his chairmanship to become a radio host with Cumulus.Surely this augured bad things for Boehner, said the mediums. After all, unlike most committee chairs, the head of the Intelligence Committee only serves at the pleasure of the speaker. Congressional visionaries noted that Rogers didn't have the best relationship with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who would be next in line to succeed Boehner as speaker. The Capitol Hill prophets murmured more. Surely Rogers' hasty departure in the middle of chairmanship must mean Boehner is out the door and that the Michigan Republican didn't stand a chance of reclaiming the gavel in the 114th Congress under "Speaker Cantor."The retirement announcement of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., fueled even more speculation about Boehner's future.Some lawmakers found it curious that Boehner was absent in late March for a controversial vote to stave off a 24 percent cut in pay for physicians who treat Medicare patients. As the vote approached, Boehner was scheduled to be in California and Arizona for fundraising activities. The decision on how to proceed with the vote was left to Cantor. It was unclear if the House had the votes to pass the measure, known as the "doc fix." Chances of a roll call vote melting down on the floor were high. Cantor elected instead to execute a "voice vote," sidestepping an actual roll call vote. The maneuver agitated members of both parties. But nonetheless, some in the chattering class saw Boehner's deference to Cantor as a sign: The speaker was checking out and handing over the baton to the gentleman from Virginia.Others were more cynical, believing Boehner's fingerprints were all over the strategy. Be out of town so rank-and-file members could see Cantor fumble a big decision.Boehner recently spent nearly $300,000 on local campaign TV commercials for the first time in four years. Some even played on Cincinnati Reds games. The sages inferred that to mean Boehner was burning off campaign cash because he was departing soon. But others saw the advertisements as a sign that Boehner was serious about re-election and staying in the House.When speaking to GOP donors in Las Vegas, Boehner recently declared he was "hell-bent" on passing immigration reform before the end of the year. That elicited a rebuke from Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck who said "everyone can tell their editors to chill." Buck said that nothing had changed and that there wasn't enough "trust" to ensure that President Obama would enforce immigration laws. But those on Boehner-watch interpreted the immigration comment as a sign the Ohio Republican was willing to move a very unpopular immigration reform measure, anyway. Such an effort could inflame rank-and-file Republican members who adamantly oppose immigration reform under any circumstances. The assertion was that the gambit could cost Boehner his job.Unless of course, Boehner was planning on leaving anyway. Then a "damn the torpedoes" strategy could make sense.All of these suppositions come as a group of 40 disgruntled House Republicans scheme not-so-quietly to oust Boehner, hopefully after the midterm elections. At the same time, prognosticators are closely watching the machinations of Cantor; House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis.; House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas; and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. Would any of them try to challenge Boehner? Would someone attempt to vault Cantor to supplant Boehner? Is Cantor in jeopardy?This is just prattle. None of it is necessarily true. None of it is necessarily false. These are merely scenarios which prompt Congressional "seers" to study every twitch as though they're reading Tarot cards.As Yoda said in The Empire Strikes Back, "hard to see the future is. Always in motion, it is."Amid all the drama, there are some facts to dispel rumors that Boehner is departing.In a March interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer, Boehner said he intended to be speaker next year."It won't even be close," Boehner told the Enquirer, adding he's "in better shape with my own caucus that I have been any time in the last three years."In addition, those close to Boehner indicate the speaker is intent on running and is acting like he plans to run. Still a few sources say Boehner won't make a formal decision until after the election. At that point, he'll know where the votes are in the House and what sort of (prospective) GOP majority he has to work with. In addition, Boehner will know if Republicans control the Senate. It is said that Boehner would relish working with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., perhaps promoted to majority leader, in an all-Republican Congress. That is, if McConnell survives his own re-election bid against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.But sources who know Boehner say the Ohio Republican doesn't even truly know what he wants to do until he evaluates the autumn landscape and assesses his own standing with the House Republican Conference.Would some Republicans really want to ignite internecine warfare if they hold control of the House? Or better yet, gain seats in the House? Or still better, score control of both chambers of Congress for the final two years of President Obama's term?Still, conservative agitators could contrive an interesting vote for House speaker in January 2015.In the 2013 election for speaker, Boehner secured 220 votes, six more than were necessary to win. The speaker must secure an outright majority, not a plurality of votes. If no candidate secures the outright majority, the House votes again. And again. And again. Until there is finally a winner.The House hasn't gone to a second ballot for speaker since 1923. Speaker Frederick Gillett, D-Mass., eventually recaptured the gavel in a crowded field on the ninth ballot over a period of three days. The House took 133 ballots and two months to select a speaker in 1856.Could rabble-rousers force a second or third ballot come January? Very possible. But if Boehner's running, it's hard to see where the votes come from to defeat him for a third term.With all this speculation, it's a wonder someone doesn't install a "Zoltar the Fortune Teller" arcade machine in the Speaker's Lobby.

Is Eric Cantor moderating his image? Washington Post offers a surprising take Oct. 23, 2013: U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor addresses a news conference at the Republican National Committee offices on Capitol Hill in Washington.ReutersAlso ... Rand and Ron ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIs Eric Cantor moderating his image? Washington Post offers a surprising takeThe Washington Post paints a sympathetic portrait of Eric Cantor that is far different from most mainstream media portrayals.And that in itself is news.It’s news because the Post took an important step in hiring Robert Costa, the story’s author. He was a reporter for National Review, not the usual training ground for major metropolitan newspapers. And Costa is especially well sourced among congressional Republicans, rather than treating them like some foreign species.It’s no secret that the House majority leader has been trying to moderate his image, and that of his party, in recent months. The question is whether this is more symbolic than substantive.What Costa is tapping into is that some conservative members of Cantor’s caucus aren’t happy with his new tone. That provides an insight into the conflicting pressures the Virginia congressman must balance — especially if he hopes to eventually succeed John Boehner.The MSM view of Cantor is that he is a canny strategist but a rock-ribbed conservative with little interest in cooperating with the Obama administration on anything. His efforts at moderating here and there have been implicitly dismissed as window dressing.Here’s how he frames Cantor’s efforts:“He has become an advocate for research on pediatric cancer, passing legislation that would increase funding for the National Institutes of Health.“Cantor has begun talking about urban poverty, visiting charter schools to explore education reform, and has sought alliances with African American lawmakers, traveling to Mississippi to appear at a civil rights event and honor Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.“And he has maneuvered behind the scenes to push House Republicans toward an eventual floor vote on a plan to legalize certain illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.”All well and good. It’s refreshing to hear a House Republican leader talking about urban poverty, when few of his lawmakers represent big cities.But none of this is big-ticket stuff, and Costa might have shown a little more skepticism. Republicans have always favored charter schools as a way of expanding alternatives to public schools. The one exception would be an immigration vote, and that, for the moment, doesn’t seem to be happening.Nor has Cantor delivered on suggestions of a Republican health care plan that would replace ObamaCare.The Post story notes that “a handful of conservative members have expressed their disapproval of the new strategy, particularly given that its architect is a man they considered a fellow partisan warrior.” And it quotes a former Harry Reid aide as saying Cantor is good at putting together “small-bore, feel good items.”But Costa does provide a broader lens on the majority leader, and that is a step forward for the Post.Rand and RonElsewhere on the Republican front, Bloomberg Businessweek offers a warning about Rand Paul, who’s been getting some good press and has essentially won the media’s designation as the 2016 front-runner.The flashing red light is about Ron Paul.The piece by Josh Green says:“Rand Paul has always seemed annoyed by questions about his dad. When I interviewed him last year, he waved off that line of inquiry and focused on dead Fed chairmen. Now Paul is attempting to put the subject officially off limits. Via Slate’s Dave Weigel, Paul declared … that he has ‘quit answering’ questions about his father. ‘I’ve been in the Senate three years, and I have created a record of myself,’ he said. ‘And I have my opinions.’“As Weigel points out, this is a laughable double standard, since Paul recently tried to associate another politician-with-a-record — Hillary Clinton — to a family member’s ‘predatory behavior.’"The bigger problem for Paul is that this is like putting up a flashing neon sign that reads ‘Controversy Guaranteed!’ to the political press corps. If there’s one thing reporters are great at, it’s asking the same question over and over again until a politician flips his lid.”Green has a valid point here. Rand Paul is his own man. But when your father has been a presidential candidate, and you’ve inherited his organization, it’s hard for a White House contender to refuse all comment. Top Twitter TalkObamaCare deadline extension angers Republicans Click for more from Media Buzz. Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Janet Murguia: By Ignoring Lessons Of 2012, GOP Is Driving Latino Voters Further Away It was exactly a year ago that the Republican National Committee (RNC) released an assessment of its resounding defeat in the 2012 election, known as the âautopsy report.â  That soul-searching piece rightly laid the defeat of Mitt Romney at the feet of the partyâs profound disconnect with anyone outside its âcore constituencies,â including young people, women, and Black and Latino voters. However, the political winds can shift quickly and it is no secret that Republicans are in much better shape politically than they were a year ago, especially when it comes to the 2014 midterm elections. But if the Republican Party continues to ignore the lessons of 2012, 2014 will be its last hurrah.- Janet MurguiaThose of us who have long argued that it is in the Latino communityâs best interest to be courted by both parties experienced a hopeful moment last year. The autopsy report was released in the midst of the first meaningful push for comprehensive immigration reform in nearly a decade, as a bipartisan group of senators, the Gang of Eight, successfully shepherded a bill through the Senate. With the president firmly committed to signing a bill, the only thing left in June of last year was for the House of Representatives to act. Well, it is now nearly a year later and the House has proven itself to be an unmitigated disaster on immigration. Not only has it not voted on the Senate bill, it apparently canât be bothered to read it because itâs âtoo long.â There has been a lot of chatter about the House advancing its own bill, but absolutely nothing has been introduced, let alone debated. And the only successful votes, which were engineered by Rep. Steve King (RâIA) â yes, the same congressman who claims to detect an undocumented immigrant by the size of his or her calves â would roll back the only positive immigration program of the last several years: deferred action for the students known as DREAMers.In short, it is still 2010 among too many Republicans, with the familiar refrains of âno amnestyâ and warnings about the âbrowning of America.â  But it is not 2010 and it never will be again. There are now four million more Hispanic voters than there were just four years ago. There are eight million more who can register to vote right now. And every single day, 2,000 young Latino U.S. citizens turn 18, a trend that will continue for at least the next 15 years. There is no sugar-coating the fact that the situation for the Republican Party vis-Ã¡-vis Latinos is dire and arguably worse than it was a year ago, with the stalling of reform in the House and the needless evisceration of Republican leaders who have attempted to help the party on the issue, such as Marco Rubio (RâFL). But it is not hopeless. It was only a decade ago that President Bush garnered a very healthy 44 percent of the Latino vote in his reelection. The fact that this percentage was reduced by nearly half by 2012 should be a cautionary tale for those who refuse to moderate their views on immigration reform or the Latino community.While the situation is not hopeless, the challenge is not easy to overcome. It is going to take more than the baby steps that the RNC talked about this week in their autopsy anniversary news conference. This is not solely an issue of more outreach or better marketing. As the autopsy so eloquently stated, there is something fundamentally flawed in the way too many in the Republican Party view our community and our issues. And it is no exaggeration to say that the survival of the party depends on admitting that the flaw exists and then finding a way to fix it. A good start would be for the House leadership to allow a vote on comprehensive immigration reform.     Janet MurguÃ­a is president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
The Jeb Boomlet: Why journalists are promoting another Bush candidacy March 27, 2014: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2016, during a education panel discussion at Advanced Technologies Academy, in Las Vegas. Bush is the chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which promotes expanding charter schools and vouchers to allow students to attend private schools. (AP Photo/Las Vegas Review-Journal, Jeff Scheid)You know who wants Jeb Bush to run for president? The pundits.It's not that they pine for another Bush in the White House; it's that they need a GOP front-runner, preferably a household name.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe Republican race is too amorphous for their taste. Every story has to mention Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and on and on. What journalists love is a two-person showdown, especially if each candidate hails from a different wing of the party, paving the way for lots of civil war themes.Christie was their guy. A brash, blunt blue-stater with a relatively moderate approach. But the governor’s bus hit the bridge pothole, and even after the self-exoneration and those interviews with Megyn Kelly and Diane Sawyer, he is rolling on punctured tires.So the media are gravitating back toward Jeb, who is plainly ambivalent about running. And here's how it works: reporters call up a bunch of party stalwarts and money men and ask if they'd like to see Bush get in. Sure, these folks say. Then we report a "surge" of interest in Jeb.The story's foundation is real; Jeb Bush could easily get the backing of the establishment wing of the party, which doesn't want a hyper-conservative nominee in 2016. You could make a case that New York and Beltway pundits would also be more comfortable with a third President Bush than with a President Rand Paul.But Jeb is no more likely to run this week than he was last week. What's changed is the media climate.The Washington Post kickstarted the process with this piece:"Many of the Republican Party’s most powerful insiders and financiers have begun a behind-the-scenes campaign to draft former Florida governor Jeb Bush into the 2016 presidential race, courting him and his intimates and starting talks on fundraising strategy."Concerned that the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal has damaged New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s political standing and alarmed by the steady rise of Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), prominent donors, conservative leaders and longtime operatives say they consider Bush the GOP’s brightest hope to win back the White House."Of course, such stories eventually have to pause and consider the Bush baggage.The former Florida governor hasn't run for anything since 2002. That was pre-Twitter, and he may not have the agility and determination to withstand today's crazy obstacle course.This is not his brother's GOP. On issues from education to immigration, he is out of step with the party's Tea Party direction. Bush has openly questioned whether his father—and his dad’s running mate, Ronald Reagan—would fit in today’s Republican Party and an “orthodoxy that doesn’t allow for disagreement.”Then there's the last name. George W. Bush was not exactly popular when he left office after Iraq, Katrina and a financial crisis. Jeb is his own man, but the association is a powerful one.Yes, yes, Hillary would be a perfect opponent, neutralizing the royal-family argument. But Bill Clinton will have left the presidency 16 years earlier; W. will have vacated eight years earlier.As Slate's John Dickerson points out:"On domestic issues, the Bush family is synonymous among some conservatives with tax increases and federal spending. Perhaps the greatest sin in the modern conservative movement is George H. W. Bush’s 1990 budget deal where he traded tax increases for budget savings. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, has cited his father’s compromise as the epitome of presidential leadership. George W. Bush is criticized for his lack of spending restraint as well as his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which some might count as the second greatest sin)."And then there's Iraq. It's virtually impossible for Bush to renounce his brother's war, a quagmire that turned out to be extremely unpopular.Another problem is that conservatives will argue that Bush is cut from the same cloth as John McCain and Mitt Romney (whose backers are pushing Jeb), and therefore destined to lose. As Dickerson notes, Bush "isn’t being called from the counter in coffee shops or Tuesday Tips club meetings. The support is coming from what one GOP veteran referred to as 'the donor class.'  This group is also variously referred to as the establishment, Country Club Republicans, and the moderate wing of the party. These Republicans are tired of being defined by the unpopular Tea Party wing of the party."One quote that jumped out from the Post story involves the specter of Bush fatigue. Former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour was sympathetic, saying: “If his name was Jeb Brown instead of Jeb Bush, he’d be the front-runner.”But actually, if his name was Jeb Brown, he might never have become governor.On the plus side, Jeb would inherit his brother's (and father's) fundraising network, and that provides instant credibility.But will he run? Bush has been making speeches around the country, campaigning for other Republicans, and clearly keeping the door ajar.And the pundits are happy to keep holding it wide open for him. Top Twitter TalkDems crow about ObamaCare enrollmentHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Jeb Bush Getting Little Love Over 'Act Of Love' Remark, Quip Could Derail Presidential Bid MIAMI (AP) –  With a single phrase of compassion for immigrants in the U.S. illegally, Jeb Bush has prompted questions about his viability as a potential presidential contender and underscored how divisive the immigration issue remains for the Republican Party.The former Florida governor sparked a conservative furor this week when he described illegal immigration in an interview as an "act of love" by people trying to provide for their families.Backing Bush are some of the GOP's most powerful insiders and financiers, who are hoping the party can woo Hispanic voters and rebound from Mitt Romney's damaging "self-deportation" rhetoric in 2012."The worst thing that can happen to a political party is not for voters to decide they don't like you," said Alex Castellanos, a GOP consultant and former Romney adviser. "It's for voters to decide you don't like them. And that's where the Republican Party is right now."The Republican National Committee has urged the GOP to embrace an immigration overhaul, but comprehensive legislation remains stalled in Congress. Action is unlikely in an election year with high stakes. Republicans expect to hold the House and need to gain only six Senate seats to win majority control from Democrats. While party leaders want to avoid an immigration fight that could alienate their core voters, some establishment Republicans say the delay threatens the long-term future of the GOP.Other GOP lawmakers and conservative activists, however, are cringing over Bush's remarks, which triggered vocal opposition and concerns about "amnesty.""We appreciate the compassion in the statement, but the best compassion you can show a people is to uphold justice," said Tamara Scott, a Republican National committeewoman and prominent Christian conservative from Iowa.Some in the Republican establishment are concerned immigration could define the coming nominating contest in the way it did the last one. Like Bush, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was jeered when he implied that his rivals were heartless if they opposed a law that lets some children of immigrants here illegally to pay in-state tuition at public colleges.Romney took a hard line on immigration. He ultimately won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, the lowest portion for a Republican in 16 years.The Republican National Committee has urged the GOP to embrace an immigration overhaul, but comprehensive legislation remains stalled in Congress. Action is unlikely in an election year with high stakes. Republicans expect to hold the House and need to gain only six Senate seats to win majority control from Democrats. While party leaders want to avoid an immigration fight that could alienate their core voters, some establishment Republicans say the delay threatens the long-term future of the GOP."It's going to kill the Republican Party," said Al Hoffman, a Republican megadonor who chaired George W. Bush's presidential campaigns.He and others argue the GOP needs a nominee with a "Nixon-goes-to-China mentality" in which the party leader takes an audacious, if not popular, step on issues such as immigration. They suggest that's necessary in part to peel away some Hispanic voters from Democrats in 2016.For Bush, the debate is personal. His wife, Columba, was born in Mexico and grew up there. The two met while Bush was an exchange student there; she is now an American citizen.On Sunday, in an interview with Fox News before an audience at the George Bush Presidential Library in Texas, Jeb Bush said immigrants who enter the country illegally should, in fact, pay a penalty. But he added that he viewed such a violation as "a different kind of crime.""Yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony," he said. "It's an act of love."On Thursday, speaking to the Connecticut Republican Party's annual Prescott Bush Awards dinner, named after Bush's late grandfather, he defended his remarks."The simple fact is, there is no conflict between enforcing our laws, believing in the rule of law and having some sensitivity to the immigrant experience, which is part of who we are as a country," Bush said. "It's not an American value to allow people to stay in the shadows."Hispanics are a crucial voting bloc in an increasing number of swing-voting states, from Florida to Colorado to Nevada.Some see a new opportunity for the GOP to appeal to Latinos, many of whom have soured on President Barack Obama because of his administration's record-setting number of deportations."Hispanics are eager to hear from a leader in the Republican Party talk about immigration in the way that Jeb Bush talked about it," said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, the country's largest Hispanic civil rights organization.In contrast to the 2012 nomination fight, most of the potential 2016 presidential contenders have signaled support for some kind of immigration overhaul. But they remain divided over whether legislation should offer a pathway to citizenship for those living here illegally. After the Senate passed a bipartisan measure last year that would do just that, the barrage of conservative criticism virtually silenced the GOP's most outspoken immigration advocates, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.The furor over Bush's remarks shows the potential perils of picking up the issue, especially in the early voting states that play an outsized role in choosing party nominees.Bush, the two-term, Spanish-speaking former governor of a state with a booming Hispanic population, has struggled to articulate his views in a party that has changed dramatically since the last time he ran for office in 2002.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Jeb Bush: ‘I’m thinking about running for president’ Feb. 26, 2013: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush talks after his address on education to the Texas Business Leadership Council in Austin, Texas.APJeb Bush said Wednesday he's "thinking about running for president," in his most direct statement yet about a possible 2016 run. The former Florida governor spoke at a Catholic school benefit in New York Wednesday morning. He previously has said he'll make a decision on whether to run for president before the end of this year, making clear that he was considering the possibility. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBut his comments on Wednesday appeared to be more direct. Asked what his "immediate plans" were, he said, according to an attendee: "I'm thinking about running for president." The answer was met with applause and a standing ovation, after which Bush said: "Can someone call my mother so she can hear this?" the source told FoxNews.com. His mother, Barbara Bush, has previously dismissed the prospect of another son running for president, saying "We've had enough Bushes." She later backed off that view, and even seemed to tout a possible Jeb Bush candidacy in a recent Fox News interview. The event on Wednesday, which was closed to the press, was attended by Cardinal Timothy Dolan and meant to raise money for the Archdiocese of New York's Catholic schools. Bush affirmed his interest in a presidential bid a couple hours after David Axelrod dismissed the idea. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, told MSNBC on Wednesday morning that "I have some real doubts as to whether he's going to run." "Running in the Republican Party today is a hard thing to do, and I don't think Jeb Bush wants to run for president and have to subjugate his principles like the last two nominees did," Axelrod told MSNBC. Prominent GOP officials and donors reportedly have launched a campaign to draft him into the race. In an interview aired earlier this month on "Fox News Sunday," Bush said he'd make a decision by the end of the year. But, in a preview of the scrutiny to come should he decide to enter the race, he made comments about immigration that antagonized some on the right. In the interview, he said those who enter the U.S. illegally do so to help their families. "It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family," Bush said. "I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families." A recent Fox News poll showed Bush holding his own among possible 2016 candidates. The poll, which asked Republicans about their preferred 2016 GOP candidate, showed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie leading with 15 percent, followed by Bush and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 14 percent each. Bush is hardly the only high-profile Republican publicly flirting with a bid. Texas Gov. Rick Perry told Fox News on Wednesday he's giving the possibility of another run "serious consideration." Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Jeb Bush says decision on 2016 run coming before year's end, says illegal immigration can be 'act of love'  Former Florida governor Jeb Bush has said that he would make a decision on whether to run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination before the end of this year and said that some immigrants who enter the United States illegally do so as an "act of love"for their families. Bush made the remarks in an interview broadcast on "Fox News Sunday" while attending a celebration of the 25th anniversary of his father's inauguration at George H.W. Bush's presidential library in College Station, Texas. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTWithout ever officially entering the race, Bush has emerged as a tantalizing Republican candidate. The Washington Post reported last week that some prominent Republican party officials and donors had launched a campaign to draft him into the race as an alternate to scandal-hit New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and libertarian-leaning Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. On Sunday, Bush said all the speculation about his candidacy is actually getting him more attention than if he had already entered the race.Bush, who served two terms as Florida governor between 1999 and 2007, described the state of politics as "crazy right now," and added that one factor in his decision will be whether he can deliver an optimistic, hopeful message without getting drawn into a political "mud fight." He says the other main factor in his decision will be whether it's OK with his family if he ran.Bush has antagonized many Republicans by supporting immigration reform and the national educational standards known as Common Core.On immigration, he said that those who come into the country illegally generally do so because they had no other means to provide for their family, and what they did is "not a felony.""It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family," Bush said. "I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime.

I'm not being critical of my party, but campaigns themselves are reflective of this new America."Jeb Bush has not taken any public steps toward building a campaign or an organization, but as the son and brother of former presidents he has a built-in legitimacy and name recognition that any candidate would kill for.Andrew H. Card Jr., who worked in both previous Bush administrations, told The New York Times, "If Jeb Bush doesn't run for president, shame on us. He is demonstrating the kind of leadership we desperately need both in our party and in our nation."Not everybody, including conservative Tea Party voters, may agree. If he does run, Jeb Bush may not even have his mom's vote.

Jeb shows ‘love’ to illegal immigrants, but will GOP love him back?  Also ... Christie loses a fanADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTSliming Pelosi Jeb shows ‘love’ to illegal immigrants, but will GOP love him back? Jeb Bush may or may not run for president. In fact, he said over the weekend that his undecided stance has “generated more interest” than if he were running — a nod to all the media coverage that seems part of an effort to lure him into the race.But by standing his ground on illegal immigration, directly challenging his party’s right wing, Bush is sending a signal. He is willing to become the third Bush to make a White House bid if he can do it his way. And if he can’t, well, he doesn’t seem driven to make the run, and still has to weigh his family’s reservations.To speak about showing compassion to people in this country illegally has in recent years been a ticket to oblivion in the Republican primaries. To do it at a 25th- anniversary celebration of his father’s presidency, in remarks partially carried by Fox News, was nothing less than laying down a marker.If Bush is a 2016 candidate, he reaps two benefits from this immigration stance. One, the MSM are sympathetic to his position and believe the Republicans need to repair their battered image with Hispanics by moving on immigration reform. Two, if Bush wins the nomination, he will have a stronger chance of making inroads with Hispanic voters.But can Bush run on a “hopeful” message and resist “the vortex of a mud fight,” as he put it? Did he watch the party’s 2012 demolition derby?The New York Times :“In perhaps his most expansive public discussion yet of a possible candidacy, Mr. Bush, a longtime supporter of overhauling immigration laws, warned against ‘harsh political rhetoric’ on the subject and urged more compassion for those who enter the country illegally for economic reasons. ‘Yes, they broke the law, but it’s not a felony; it’s an act of love,’ he said. ‘It’s a different kind of crime. There should be a price paid. It shouldn’t rile people up that people are actually coming to provide for their families.’”The former Florida governor not only threw down the gauntlet on immigration, he “defended his commitment to the so-called Common Core set of educational standards." As Bush told Fox, "Maybe it's stubbornness, but I just don’t feel compelled to run for cover when I think this is the right thing to do for our country."Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza observes that “moving far to the right to appease conservative primary voters played a role in dooming the eventual Republican presidential nominees the past two election cycles. Staying on middle ground as long as possible is a strategy the Republican Party hasn't tried in awhile. Come the end of the year, when Jeb Bush finally decides whether he wants to become the third member of his family to submit a rental application for the White House, we'll see if the always immediate uproar about ‘soft’ immigration views on the right is something that's dying out.”At National Review, Jim Geraghty counters the just-supporting-their –families argument by saying “a significant number of Mexicans do not believe that the United States has the moral or legal authority to keep them out. Their concept of the border is fundamentally different from how it is defined under our laws.”As for Bush’s “act of love” comment, he says, “you know what that sounds like? Flash back about two and a half years, to another governor who was considered a strong contender for the Republican presidential nomination: ‘If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they’ve been brought there by no fault of their own, I don’t think you have a heart.’“Jeb’s going to have to be very careful on this, because Perry’s comment was one of the first major missteps of a doomed campaign.” And Rick Perry wasn’t the only one who took heat (from Mitt Romney among others) for that stance. Newt Gingrich said during a debate that "I do not believe that the people of the United States are going to take people who've been here for a quarter of a century” and “separate them from their families and expel them."Buzzfeed Editor Ben Smith throws cold water on the whole idea:“The notion that Jeb Bush is going to be the Republican presidential nominee is a fantasy nourished by the people who used to run the Republican Party. Bush has been out of a game that changed radically during the 12 years(!) since he last ran for office. He missed the transformation of his brother from Republican savior to squish; the rise of the tea party; the molding of his peer Mitt Romney into a movement conservative; and the ascendancy of a new generation of politicians — Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, among them — who have been fully shaped by and trained in that new dynamic. Those men occasionally, carefully, respectfully break with the movement. Scorning today’s Republican Party is, by contrast, the core of Jeb’s political identity.”There are, of course, other issues in a potential Bush candidacy, which could also affect Marco Rubio’s decision to run. Chief among them is the family baggage and the inevitable need to defend his brother’s handling of Iraq and other issues.If Bush indeed takes the plunge, it could trigger a healthy immigration debate within the GOP. But he may decide, as an act of love for his family, not to take on the party’s grassroots.Christie loses a fanFolks who follow New Jersey politics know that Chris Christie has had a falling out with former governor Tom Kean, who got him into politics, served as a mentor and was with Christie on the night of his landslide reelection. Still, this Ryan Lizza piece on Christie in the New Yorker is attracting attention for a killer Kean quote:“He doesn’t always try to persuade you with reason. He makes you feel that your life’s going to be very unhappy if you don’t do what he says.” One of Christie’s flaws, says Kean, “is that he makes enemies and keeps them.” Sliming PelosiCan we all agree that sexualizing images of prominent women is a nasty business?Conservatives were upset, and rightly so, when Hustler ran a photoshopped picture of CNN’s S.E.

Jeb’s Payday Paradox: Can he afford to run for the presidency? Feb. 26, 2013: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush talks after his address on education to the Texas Business Leadership Council in Austin, Texas.APAlso...David Gregory on the couch ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTJeb’s Payday Paradox: Can he afford to run for the presidency?There’s a new question about Jeb Bush and 2016: Is he prepared to make the financial sacrifice involved in running for the presidency?The former Florida governor is making big bucks running what might be called Jeb Inc., and he’d have to walk away from that for the uncertainty of an arduous campaign.That’s my takeaway from a New York Times piece on Bush’s private-sector moneymaking. Leaving aside the media scrutiny of his ventures and the potential political impact, could Jeb decide that it’s just not worth it?Governors and senators don’t face this kind of dilemma. Mike Huckabee has said that a reluctance to give up his income from Fox News and elsewhere was a factor in his passing on the 2012 race and could influence him again.If Jeb Bush is already ambivalent about running—and he had to be struck by conservative criticism of his describing illegal immigration as an “act of love”—his financial situation may loom large.People think of the Bushes as rich, but the Times says Jeb left office in 2007 determined to increase his net worth of $1.3 million:“As he explores a White House bid, friends said, Mr. Bush’s lucrative career is an unspoken but potent factor in his decision making. Entering the 2016 Republican field would inevitably require dismantling the business empire that he has assembled — an empire that now employs his son Jeb Bush Jr.”He’s earned more than $3 million in board fees and stock grants from public companies and gives speeches at $50,000 a pop.Politicians with little or no business experience are regularly accused of not knowing how the real world works. But pols who plunge into business are invariably tied to controversial clients and ventures. There is no greater example than Mitt Romney, whose tenure at Bain Capital was thoroughly picked apart by the Obama campaign.You can easily imagine the 30-second ad on this one: Bush was a director of a company called InnoVida that “ had faked documents, lied about the health of the business and misappropriated $40 million in company funds, records show. The company went bankrupt in 2011, its founder eventually went to jail and investors lost nearly all of their money.” Ouch.Bush was also involved in the effort to save Lehman Brothers, which fairly or unfairly ties him to the Wall Street meltdown that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.And he’s a director of Tenet Health Care, which supported ObamaCare and urged people to sign up under the law.Is it unfair for the Times to unearth all this at such an early stage? It’s actually a sneak preview of what Bush can expect from the press if he runs. And you can be sure any Democratic opponent will be vacuuming up every available scrap of his business record for future attacks.Still, the overriding question for Jeb, giving the bruising nature of today’s campaigns: Does he want to give up the dough?David Gregory on the couch Talk about burying the lead.In a Washington Post piece about “Meet the Press” languishing in third place, there was this deep in the story:“Last year, the network undertook an unusual assessment of the 43-year-old journalist, commissioning a psychological consultant to interview his friends and even his wife. The idea, according to a network spokeswoman, Meghan Pianta, was “to get perspective and insight from people who know him best.” But the research project struck some at NBC as odd, given that Gregory has been employed there for nearly 20 years.”Which, of course, everyone else immediately led with.An NBC spokeswoman later told Politico it had been a “brand consultant,” but author Paul Farhi says he checked twice with the network.Gregory knows he can never replace the late Tim Russert, but six years after Russert’s death, the once-dominant show is running behind Bob Schieffer’s “Face the Nation” and “This Week” with sometimes Stephanopoulos.“I’m not just trying to sell you — well, I am trying to sell you — but I’m not going to B.S. you, either. Yeah, it’s hard. I see what our challenges are. But we’re going to fix our problems,” Gregory is quoted as saying.The fixes include shorter interviews, faster-paced segments and a broader range of topics.But the real mystery is: What did the psychological/brand consultant conclude about David Gregory?Click for more from Media Buzz.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Killer of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn to be freed after serving 12 years of 18-year sentence AMSTERDAM –  The animal rights activist who assassinated Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002 is due to be released Friday, after serving 12 years of an 18-year sentence.Release after serving two-thirds of a sentence is the norm in the Netherlands.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTVolkert van der Graaf killed Fortuyn days before national elections in which Fortuyn was set to win big on an anti-immigration platform that reversed the then-progressive Dutch political landscape.Most of Fortuyn's ideas have since become reality.Van der Graaf's sentence has been widely criticized as too light. Judges had to choose between a maximum sentence of 20 years for a first-time offender motivated by misguided principles, or life in prison without parole.Justice Ministry spokesman Jochgem van Opstal said Van der Graaf's release has conditions attached. 
Krauthammer: Jeb Bush’s immigration comments ‘kind of bizarre’  Charles Krauthammer said on "Special Report with Bret Baier" Monday that Jeb Bush's comments on immigration policy were “kind of bizarre.”Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor was referring to Bush’s remarks Sunday about illegal immigrants in an exclusive interview with Fox News.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe former Florida governor said then, "Yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love, it's an act of commitment to your family. "Krauthammer said he does not doubt Bush's sincerity or honesty.Instead, he asked about the millions of people waiting patiently to immigrate.“After all there are millions of people around the world equally compassionate about the future of their children who are waiting patiently and legally in line and who love their children no less,” he said. “And yet, there's supposed to be this special compassion for those who jump the fence and break the law.”     Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Krauthammer: Justice Department clemency initiative is 'lawlessness'  Charles Krauthammer told viewers Wednesday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that a new Department of Justice plan to offer clemency to thousands of nonviolent federal inmates is “lawlessness” on the part of the Obama administration.On Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General James Cole unveiled the plan offering a path to release for potentially thousands of federal inmates -- most jailed on drug charges -- provided they meet a specific set of criteria. Among the steps: the offenders must have been convicted of a nonviolent crime with no links to organized crime and have served at least 10 years of their sentence with good conduct. The applicant must also be someone subject to a “substantially lower sentence” for the crime under current federal law.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTProponents argue the move puts the current prison population more in line with current sentencing guidelines, and helps address the problem of overcrowding; there are currently 216,000 individuals incarcerated in federal facilities across the country.Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, said that it’s not so much the plan that’s problematic, but the Obama administration's pattern of behavior regarding many policy changes. “If it were just this alone, you would say yes. On the merits it's not a bad idea, there was over-sentencing in the past," he said. "But we know what he's done with immigration reform. ...Legislation comes from Congress, it doesn't come from the White House. Why can't the president obey the Constitution, execute the laws faithfully, and let Congress change them? Which is what he ought to be doing.”Krauthammer added that while those who apply for clemency meet the standards put before them, it’s important to take into account the details of their conviction as well. “There is one thing we ought to consider: many of these people, many who end up with sentences like these, have plea bargained, so they really should've gotten much tougher stuff.”“They could have been a dealer but in order to get a prosecution they would get an admission that the person either used or was small time or wasn't involved in a gang," Krauthammer continued. "So you've got people who may be pretty bad apples in this crowd, that you want to be extremely careful about releasing. Yes, some of them were over-sentenced, but I hope this is not going to be a mass clemency done for political reasons and for show reasons.”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Krauthammer: Should we trust pope or man behind broken ObamaCare promise?  Charles Krauthammer said Thursday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that people can either believe President Obama’s version of what happened at his meeting with Pope Francis, or they can choose a different option offered by the Vatican.While President Obama said he avoided discussing “social schisms” during his meeting with Pope Francis, the Vatican’s official readout said discussion turned to “the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection, as well as the issue of immigration reform.”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“On the one hand, you’ve got the bishop of Rome, the Holy See, of whom a billion co-religionists believe in his infallibility,” Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor, said. “On the other hand, you’ve got the man who said, 'If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.’”Krauthammer said it is possible there is a way to “square the circle” between the two versions.“The Vatican made clear it was including the conversation with the pope and the one (President Obama had) with the secretary of state, whereas Obama tried to make it very narrow, just a conversation with the pope,” he said. “So if you wanted to say they’re both right, you’d say the emphasis on Obama’s conversation with the secretary of state was on the religious issues.”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
La expansiÃ³n de la poblaciÃ³n en el oeste de Pennsylvania depende de los inmigrantes PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania, EE.UU. –  El crecimiento de la poblaciÃ³n en el oeste de Pennsylvania en los prÃ³ximos aÃ±os dependerÃ¡ mÃ¡s de los camiones de mudanza que de las cigÃ¼eÃ±as, segÃºn los expertos.La disminuciÃ³n natural de la poblaciÃ³n de la zona — representada por una cifra de funerales mayor que la de nacimientos cada aÃ±o — se ha visto compensada en parte por aquellas personas que han llegado aquÃ­ desde otras partes de Estados Unidos y del mundo."En este momento, la inmigraciÃ³n internacional es mucho mayor que la migraciÃ³n interna", dijo Chris Briem, economista regional del Centro para la InvestigaciÃ³n Social y Urbana de la Universidad de Pittsburgh.

Al mismo tiempo, las muertes en la regiÃ³n superaron a los nacimientos por 3.376 individuos, segÃºn los cÃ¡lculos de marzo."El crecimiento dependerÃ¡ de si hay personas llegando aquÃ­ o no", dijo Briem.La regiÃ³n incluye a los condados de Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington y Westmoreland.AbdulÃ¡ al-Ghadhib, de 22 aÃ±os, llegÃ³ hace cuatro aÃ±os a Estados Unidos desde Arabia SaudÃ­.

L.A. Girl Who Pleaded With Pope For Her Father In Deportation Gets Her Miracle Jersey Vargas hoped for a miracle – and got one, in just days, no less.Last Wednesday, the 10-year-old California girl met with Pope Francis at the Vatican to tell him about her father, who faced deportation.On Friday, her father, Mario Vargas, was released from the Louisiana immigrant detention center where he has been held while in deportation proceedings following an arrest last year in Tennessee for driving under the influence, for which he was convicted.Jersey reunited with her father, who left the facility after a relative posted a $5,000 bond, at Los Angeles Airport."It was the best thing ever," Jersey was quoted by CBS as saying. "I didn't celebrate my birthdays because my dad wasn't with me. I've been waiting for him."Her father was overwhelmed by his daughter’s advocacy on his behalf."I don't have the words to describe of the actions that she was able to do," he said, through an interpreter, according to CBS.His fate here is uncertain. He still faces deportation."I feel very proud because I had been fighting for him for a very long time," said Jersey. "It's been very hard since my dad hasn't been home. My mom has had to be the provider for my family, she's been the mother and father for two years."Mario Vargas' release came after his daughter, of Panorama City, Calif., addressed the pope last week as part of a California delegation that traveled to urge the Vatican to prod President Barack Obama on immigration reform. The girl and a teenager went as part of the 16-member group to represent the American children of immigrant parents who are afraid their families will be divided by deportation. The president and the pontiff met for the first time Thursday.Bryan Cox, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said an immigration judge will determine the outcome of Vargas’s deportation case.Lola Vargas said she had been gathering money to pay for her Mexican husband's bond but didn't have enough until one of his cousins called, surprised to see the girl on television, and offered to help. Her husband had gone to Tennessee to look for work in construction and had been sending money to his family in California, she said.Juan Jose Gutierrez, an immigrant advocate who coordinated the trip to Italy, said the archdiocese of Los Angeles helped get the group a key spot so they could speak with Pope Francis amid the crowds.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
L.A. Girl With Dad In Deportation Asks Pope Francis To Push For U.S. Immigration Reform Young Jersey Vargas arrived at the Vatican Wednesday morning carrying a cloth handkerchief her mother sewed with the words âNest of Loveâ across the front.The 10-year-old girl's hope was to be able to hand it directly to none other than the pope himself.Despite a note from Los Angeles Archbishop JosÃ© Gomez that got Vargas and a group of southern California immigration activists a general audience with Pope Francis, in reality there was still a slim chance that the young girl would actually get close enough to get a good look at leader of the Catholic Church, let alone be able to ask him to help her father, who faces deportation.But yet there he was, standing right in front of her.The talkative and self-assured Vargas quickly handed Pope Francis the engraved good-luck charm she had brought from California and received a blessing and kiss from the pope, before pleading her familyâs case to the pontiff.The unlikely gathering took place just one day before Pope Francis was scheduled to receive President Barack Obama.- Jersey VargasâI told him to pray for my family and to ask the president to stop deportation because it's separating my family,â Vargas told Fox News Latino in a telephonic interview from Rome following her papal visit. âHe blessed me and told me he would bring this up with President Obama.âVargas was part of a group of about a dozen immigration activists who traveled to Rome seeking an audience with Pope Francis to ask him to speak to Obama about immigration reform. The group also delivered more than 1,000 letters to the pope from children whose families are in danger of deportation or have family members who were deported, said Doris Benavides of the L.A. Archdiocese.âThey handed more than 1,000 letters from the children of undocumented immigrants to the Pope,â Benavides. âItâs our big hope that this will lead to the start of more communication in terms of passing immigration reform.âAfter a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus earlier this month, Obama pledged to look into more humane ways to deal with immigration. The caucus had been planning to draft a resolution demanding the president curb deportations and give a break to millions of other undocumented immigrants just like he did with so-called "Dreamers."In 2012, Obama announced an initiative, known as DACA, suspending deportation for two years for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors and who meet other criteria. Those immigrants who qualified for DACA have been able to obtain work permits and driverâs licenses.In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure that both tightened enforcement and called for a path to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants. But the effort stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority and where there is resistance to any measure that would provide a path to legalize for undocumented immigrants.Amid the perennial impasse over immigration reform Washington, activists like those in Rome right now claim that reaching out to Church leaders for support can help put a human face on the dilemma.âI think that there is no one better way than the pope to frame the issue in a human dimension that can be understood by everyone concerned,â Immigration activist Juan JosÃ© GutiÃ©rrez, the trip coordinator, told Los Angeles media.While Obamaâs meeting with Pope Francis Thursday is expected to focus mainly on global poverty, Vargas is hopeful that her the pope will take her message to heart and will press Obama on immigration.âI think heâll talk to President Obama about it because itâs important to stop deporting people and breaking up families,â Vargas said.Follow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

National Conservative Leader's Hunger Strike For Immigration Reform Spawns Similar Efforts Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, one of the nation’s most prominent Latino religious leaders, has subsisted on just sparkling water and broth for one week as he continues on a hunger strike to press Congress to pass an immigration reform bill.Rodriguez told Fox News Latino that he has lost nearly five pounds since he started the fast, which he intends to continue for at least 40 days. More Latino leaders and immigration reform advocates will be holding fasts in the coming weeks.“It’s an exercise in prophetic activism,” Rodriguez said, “for the purpose of raising the moral conscience, or resurrecting the moral conscience, to pass immigration reform.”He's hoping to appeal to the nation's leader's values so that, in turn, they will then be determined to enact immigration reform.“At the end of the day, there has to be some sort of moral push,” he said.The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill in June that would tighten enforcement and provide a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.  But efforts to draft legislation have stalled in the House, where conservative Republicans have vowed not to pass any measure that gives undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize. They consider a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants “amnesty,” essentially rewarding lawbreakers.Supporters of such provisions, including some Republicans, say that deporting the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants is impossible as well as not in the interest of the United States, which depends to some extent on such people to do certain jobs.Rodriguez is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the nation's largest Christian Hispanic organization, representing more than 40,000 churches. He describes himself as politically conservative though not registered or affiliated with any political party."In the spirit of Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and other leaders who have acted on the moral imperative to do justice, as well as our ultimate example found in Jesus, I likewise sense an urgent conviction to engage in the spiritual exercise that in my faith narrative produces great results," said Rodriguez just before he launched the strike.The pastor said that he has received hundreds of calls from around the country from people who plan to join in the hunger strike.On Tuesday, immigrant rights, faith, labor, and community groups plan a press conference in Washington to announce that they will also launch a fast for immigration reform. Those groups include the Church World Service, Faith in Public Life, The PICO Network, the Service Employees International Union, the Alliance for Citizenship, NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, Sojourners, Franciscan Action Network, and dozens of other groups.On Nov. 18 and 19, about 300 Hispanic religious leaders are expected to arrive in Washington D.C. to meet with congressional lawmakers about immigration.Rodriguez, who met with House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, recently, said he would be heartened by a commitment from lawmakers to move forward a bill early next year.“If I can come out of this fast with a statement that lacks ambiguity that in the next legislative session this will be the first thing they tackle, then we will have a Christmas gift for 11 million people,” he said. “I want to give 11 million people hope that this game will be over.”Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Latino Leaders To Hispanic Lawmakers: Lead Or Get Out Of The Way Of Immigration Reform Several leading Latino civil rights groups delivered a petition with nearly 10,000 signatures to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday demanding that the lawmakers be bolder in fighting for immigration reform.In a statement about the petitions, the coalition depicted the Caucus, whose members are Democrats, as hesitant to take a strong stand on the need for immigration reform and on denouncing the record number of deportations that have occurred under the Obama administration.“In the face one of the most devastating periods for Latino and other immigrants in U.S. history,” the statement said, “thousands of community members and numerous Latino community leaders from across the nation are delivering a message to Congressman Ruben Hinojosa [the caucus chair] and the leadership of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus: lead or get out of the way.”The coalition includes Presente.org, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Promise Arizona, CASA Maryland, and Voces de la Frontera.Hinojosa rejected the criticism, responding that the caucus has pushed for congressional action on an overhaul of the immigration laws. He said it was up to Republicans in the House to move the ball forward on the issue."The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has always been at the forefront of the comprehensive immigration reform debate and has long pushed for fixing our nation's broken immigration system," Hinojosa said. "CHC members have been and continue to be some of Comprehensive Immigration Reform's strongest champions, fighting for reform up front and behind the scenes. Right now more than ever, what we need is House Republican Leadership to step up to the plate and allow a vote on this critical issue."Frustration has been mounting among advocates of more flexible immigration policies over the stalled effort in the House of Representatives to vote on a measure.Republicans in the House, where they have the majority, have resisted bills that would extend a path to legal status to undocumented immigrants.The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure in June that, among other things, tightens security along the border, steps up interior enforcement, expands foreign worker visas and provides opportunities for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria to legalize their status.The coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, led by Presente, noted that some Latino lawmakers have taken a lead role in pushing for an end to the record deportations and a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.They said that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois, and Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, had been vocal, visible and assertive in fighting for immigration reform.“When eight Congressmen stepped forward to be arrested for immigration reform – including civil rights legend Congressman John L. Lewis – the only CHC members to join him were Reps. Luis Gutierrez and Raul Grijalva,” the statement said. “Four African American Congressmen were arrested fighting for immigration reform, and only two Latinos. Such a situation begs an important question: where was the rest of the Hispanic Caucus?”The coalition’s move came on the same day that Grijalva and Gutierrez held a press conference in Washington D.C. calling on Obama to stop the deportations – which have numbered early 2 million, or more than 1,000 a day, since he’s been in office – and to provide a way for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status.Gutierrez and Grijalva said that 30 Democratic members of Congress had signed a letter to Obama telling him that he has the power to stop the record deportations."In fact, taking a strong step toward granting relief would move us in the direction of where the immigration debate rightfully should start, with the legalization of eleven million men and women who call the United States their home," the letter said, according to published reports.Also on Thursday, a coalition of evangelical Christian churches announced that they would be running radio ads this month asking for prayers for House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio who holds sway over the handling of immigration reform measures in the chamber.In a briefing with reporters, Boehner said that he was committed to working on immigration reform, but in a piecemeal fashion, not in a sweeping bill. Asked if a bill would come to a vote in 2014, Boehner said he would not make predictions on a time frame.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Latinos Not Enrolling In Obamacare, New HHS Study Shows The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued it's final enrollment numbers for the Obamacare sign-up period that ended on March 31, and they present a good-news-bad-news situation.Younger and healthier than the U.S. population as a whole, Hispanics, the nation's largest minority group as well as its least insured, were viewed as crucial to the success of President Barack Obama's health insurance coverage expansion. The final count was disappointing. Latinos account for 14.5 percent of those eligible for coverage on the new health insurance markets, but they represented only 10.7 percent of the actual enrollees who also volunteered their race or ethnicity, the government reported.On the plus side, blue or red, a majority of states exceeded their health care sign-up targets under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — something that would have been hard to imagine after the botched roll-out of insurance markets last fall.According to 2012 Census figures, 29 percent of all Hispanics were without coverage compared to about 17 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of Asian-Americans and 10 percent of whites.The administration made "important first steps" to signing up Latinos, said Mayra Alvarez, associate director of the Office of Minority Health at HHS. She acknowledged, however, that there had been problems.Many Hispanics tried to get coverage under the ACA but hit roadblocks, said Jane Delgado, president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a nonpartisan advocacy network. The reasons are numerous: A Spanish version of the federal health care website was delayed and there was a shortage of in-person guides reaching out to Latinos.For some mixed-status families, a fear of immigration authorities may have discouraged enrollment. Immigrants who are in the United States illegally cannot participate in the new health insurance system, but many have eligible relatives who are citizens or legal residents."This is only the first step in a long race," Delgado said. "Many people who are uninsured don't understand the language of insurance. Big media campaigns aren't as effective for actual enrollment as the one-on-one approach."Still, the strong state-by-state performance indicates that the health care law has made inroads around the country, even as Republicans insist repealing "Obamacare" will be a winning issue in the fall congressional elections. An Associated Press analysis of the government numbers found that 31 states met or exceeded enrollment targets set by the administration before the insurance exchanges opened. Twenty of those are led by Republican governors, many of whom were hostile to the program.The Health and Human Services Department said 8 million Americans chose a health plan through the new insurance markets in the first year of the historic health care overhaul. Some 4.8 million more gained coverage through Medicaid and children's insurance programs. A surge in enrollments since March 1 doubled sign-ups in some states, including Texas, Georgia and Florida."There is reason to be optimistic about what the law can deliver, both in terms of coverage and affordable insurance options" said Andy Hyman of the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "In time, it will become part of the bloodstream of our health care system." Hyman is a senior program officer working to expand coverage.With Republicans vowing to make the failures of the law a main theme of their midterm election push, the Obama administration will need to convince the public that it has been a success. A recent administration announcement of the 8 million sign-ups failed to move public opinion much, with negative views of the law more common than positive ones. But polls also have found that Americans don't want the law repealed, preferring that Congress work to improve it instead.The new report didn't include information on how many of the newly enrolled have actually paid their insurance premiums. With grace periods for enrolling extending into mid-April, many who have signed up weren't obligated to pay until this week. A report released Wednesday by House Republicans said 67 percent of people who had signed up through federal marketplaces had paid their first month's premiums as of April 15, far lower than payment rates reported by some individual insurers, which were more in the range of 85 percent or above.The report did not include ethnicity data for about 31 percent of those who selected coverage on the federal marketplaces. Also missing was data from the 15 state-run exchanges.White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday it was no surprise that GOP lawmakers who have voted to repeal the law would put out a downbeat report about the law's progress. He said official figures on paid premiums would come out when the complete data that is currently being compiled is ready. "I'm confident it's not going to be 67 percent. I don't know what it's going to be," Carney said.Even though the administration is claiming huge successes, the Congressional Budget Office projects more than 40 million people will still be uninsured this year, and a more complete picture of who's still uninsured won't emerge until next year with the first results from large national surveys."Beyond a doubt, the number of uninsured Americans has fallen by millions. Whether it's 5 million or 15 million still isn't clear," said Larry Levitt, an expert on health insurance markets at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. "The low enrollment among Latinos is an indication of where challenges still lie: the hard-to-reach groups where more outreach is probably needed."Many of the underperforming states were those that had built their own online marketplaces. Massachusetts, which had served as a model for the Obama program, only signed up 31,695 people, far short of the goal of 250,000. Oregon, which met only 29 percent of its goal, recently decided to scrap its online marketplace and go with the federal portal.Other highlights of the report:—Young adults aged 18 to 34, whose premiums are needed to balance the cost of older, sicker enrollees, made up about 28 percent of the total 8 million. Independent analysts have said the mix should be 40 percent young adults. But the administration called the mix sufficient to keep premiums stable.—More women than men signed up through the exchanges: 54 percent vs. 46 percent.—It's still not clear how many people who purchased coverage on the new markets already had insurance. The report said of the 5.18 million who applied for financial assistance and selected a plan on the exchanges run by the federal government, 13 percent said they already had coverage.—Blacks and Asians signed up at higher-than-expected rates. Blacks make up 13.3 percent of those eligible for marketplace coverage, but represented 16.7 percent of those who chose a health plan and disclosed their race. Asians make up 3.3 percent of the eligible pool, but were 7.9 percent of enrollees who volunteered racial information.—Nearly a third of people who chose a health plan on the federal exchanges didn't report their race or ethnicity, or chose "Other."The next enrollment period for private health insurance coverage for 2015 under the health law is scheduled to run Nov. 15 through Feb. 15."They've had some success," Levitt said, "but they're going to have to do it all over again next year and get more people signed up to succeed."Based on reporting by the Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Latinos Overwhelmingly Oppose Keystone XL Pipeline, Group Claims A major Latino rights group has joined in the opposition to the proposed controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, stating that it would not only exacerbate climate change but also harm the communities living near the tar sand refineries in the southern United States.Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org, made a statement last week condemning the Keystone XL pipeline and claiming the project would disproportionally impact Latino communities.“We are calling on President Obama to reject the Keystone XL Pipeline,” said Arturo Carmona, Executive Director of Presente.org. “We urge the President to keep his promise to address climate change and start building a clean energy economy— and the first step to doing that is rejecting the Keystone XL Pipeline.”While a Pew Research Poll released last month found that 61 percent of Americans were in favor of the pipeline, Presente.org recently polled their more than 300,000 members across the country and found that environmental justice and climate change were second only to immigration in importance to their members.“Latino communities in America are concentrated in the areas most affected by climate change— from the drought-stricken southwest to coastal cities like Miami which are most threatened by rising sea levels,” Carmona said. “Additionally, refineries that would process KXL's tar sands are concentrated in Latino communities in Texas— sickening our children and families with their toxic pollution.”The Natural Resource Defense Council also supported the findings by Presente.org in its own poll. About 92 percent of those polled by the NRDC supported calling for more use of renewable energy and 87 percent agreed that there should be limits on power plant pollution.Eighty-eight percent added that it is “extremely to very important” for the government to tackle air pollution, and 75 percent added it was “extremely to very important” for the government to take action on climate change.“We have not seen this degree of consistency and this degree of high support among Latino electorate,” except in polls on immigration reform, Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions said during a press call.The overwhelming opposition among the Latino community to the Keystone XL pipeline does not, however, appear to correlate into other environmental issues, such as the fracking.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the controversial practice of sending a mixture of water, sand and chemicals down a wellbore to create small fractures underground in an attempt to release oil and natural gas. Supporters of the technique argue that it is a safe, clean way to extract resources and create much-needed jobs, while opponents argue that fracking is environmentally unsafe, causes numerous health issues and, once the shale deposits have been tapped, turn boomtowns into busts.In Colorado, with 21 percent of the state’s population being Hispanic, advocates on both sides of the fracking issue have targeted the demographic in a bid to gain support. From Spanish-language websites to claims of high-paying jobs, Latinos have become a key demographic as communities – and the state as a whole – decide what to do with the shale.Latino groups caught in the middle of this debate don’t see themselves as that much different in terms of their concerns from every other Coloradan. Hispanics are split down the environmental and economic divide that the rest of Colorado’s electorate is dealing with, said Amanda Gonzalez, the executive director of the Colorado Latino Leadership, Advocacy and Research Organization (CLLARO).“For some it is a very contentious issue in regards to the environmental problem,” Gonzalez added, “while others in the community support fracking because of the jobs that it creates.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Law Enforcement Discover Two Drug Smuggling Tunnels Stretching Across U.S.-Mexico SAN DIEGO (AP) –  Two drug-smuggling tunnels with rail systems stretching hundreds of yards across the U.S.-Mexico border were discovered by law enforcement officials, and a 73-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of helping run one operation, federal authorities said Friday.No contraband was found in connection with the tunnels, which linked warehouses in Tijuana, Mexico, and the Otay Mesa area of San Diego, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations.The first tunnel, stretching about 600 yards, was discovered Tuesday. It was described as being equipped with lighting, a crude rail system and wooden trusses.The entrance on the U.S. side is inside a warehouse where a cement cap covered a 70-foot shaft. A pulley system was installed to hoist goods into the building, which was filled with children's toys and boxes of televisions.The other tunnel, located Thursday, stretches more than 700 yards and was built with more sophisticated features including a multi-tiered electric rail system and ventilation equipment.On Wednesday, investigators with the San Diego Tunnel Task Force arrested the woman from the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista for investigation of overseeing the logistics at the location of the first tunnel. Her name was not immediately released.The tunnels were the sixth and seventh found in the area in less than four years, ICE said.U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said the discoveries foiled cartel plans to sneak large quantities of drugs across the border."Going underground is not a good business plan," she said in a statement.Other participants in the investigation include the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Mexican law enforcement officials also assisted.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Lawyer tells Vegas judge attorneys trying to free boxer Molina from jail and immigration case LAS VEGAS –  An attorney for boxer Carlos Molina has told a judge in Las Vegas that attorneys hope to get a Wisconsin warrant withdrawn and then get immigration proceedings resolved so Molina can be freed from jail.Molina is jailed in Las Vegas following his arrest March 4 on a January 2007 warrant issued in Wisconsin accusing him of failing to register as a sex offender. The judge on Tuesday scheduled another status check Thursday about Molina's case.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTMolina missed a March 8 fight to defend his IBF light middleweight title against Jermall Charlo in Las Vegas. The 30-year-old Molina was born in Mexico, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in California say he was deported in 2006.ICE has said that if he's freed from jail, he'll face additional immigration proceedings. 
Lincoln Diaz-Balart: I Am Still Hopeful Congress Can Pass Immigration Reform I am still hopeful that Congress will pass immigration reform. With millions of people in our country living in the shadows, unidentified, and strongly believing that every country needs to be able to decide who comes through its borders, I donât see how Congress can continue to fail to act.In 2009, I helped form a bipartisan working group on this critical issue in Congress. Until I left in January 2011, we met mostly weekly, sometimes twice a week.- Lincoln Diaz-BalartThe existence of the working group never leaked; much less did the substance of our work product.The bipartisan House groupâs work product constitutes a serious contribution-in-waiting toward legislation to repair an immigration system in the U.S. which is clearly broken.The Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute (CHLI), which I am honored to chair, strengthens the U.S. Hispanic community by promoting the advancement of Hispanics in all sectors of American society, with a particular emphasis in mentoring and developing the leadership potential of Hispanic youth.Because of the importance of the immigration issue to the future of the United States, for the first time in our 10-year history, CHLI formally adopted a position on a matter that is before Congress. The following principles were unanimously agreed to by CHLIâs Board of Directors:1. An earned legalization process is the most reasonable way to address undocumented persons currently in the United States, and there should be special consideration for members of the U.S. Armed Forces and âDreamers.â2. All efforts should be made to expedite the transition to permanent legal status of qualified foreign undergraduate and graduate students studying in the United States who seek such status. Additionally, to improve the quality of education for all students, primary and secondary school education funding levels should be increased, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs throughout the United States.3. An expanded H-1B, L-1, and EB visa program for professionals and highly skilled workers, and H-2B temporary visas that support seasonal industries and small businesses, are critical to the U.S. economy.4. Improving the efficiency of the agricultural worker visa program (H-2A) will allow the U.S. to maintain a reliable agricultural workforce. This, in turn, will allow the U.S. to continue producing its own food.5. Delays, backlogs, and disruptions in the immigration and border management systems that impede the movement of people and legitimate cargo across U.S. borders must be addressed, and increased enforcement targeting human trafficking, drug smuggling, terrorism, and counterfeit goods across U.S. borders, is key to maintaining U.S. security and prosperity.As a prime author of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA), which granted legal status to hundreds of thousands of worthy Central Americans in the U.S., I am convinced that it is possible to pass immigration legislation. Congress can and should pass immigration reform now.Lincoln Diaz-Balart is the founder and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute and a Member of Congress from 1993-2011.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Long Island Police Sgt. Charged With Hate Crimes For Harassing, Robbing Latino Drivers A police sergeant in Suffolk County, New York, has been charged on 20 criminal counts, seven of them hate crimes, stemming from his targeting seven Latino drivers over a four-year period and stealing cash from them, Long Island newspaper, Newsday, is reporting.The charges against Sgt. Scott A. Greene ranged from official misconduct to fourth-degree grand larceny as a hate crime."This defendant has used the authority of the badge as purely a thief's motive," Newsday quoted Suffolk County district attorney, Thomas Spota, as saying during a Monday afternoon news conference. "In our view he was clearly targeting Hispanics who he knew were prone to carry cash."The investigation of Greene began in January after two Latino men said the police officer had stopped them in an area of Long Island which falls within his beat and took money from pay envelopes they had.According to police, Greene was videotaped taking $100 in cash from an envelope on the front seat of a car driven by an undercover police officer. Greene makes about $127,000 and about $19,000 in overtime, Newsday reported in January.Spota then assigned nine investigators and two prosecutors, all of them Spanish-speakers, to investigate further."It became fairly clear to us that this was not the first time Sgt. Greene had done this," Spota said.According to Newsday, the district attorney went on to say that 22 people had come forward with remarkably similar stories. Based on their accounts, Greene's m.o. went like this: The policeman would pat down victims, taking their wallets and removing cash – $50 or $100 typically. It is believed that no other officers were involved in the scheme, although activists working on behalf of the victims are calling for a more comprehensive investigation of the police department.Authorities and activists say it is likely that Latino drivers were targeted because some may be immigrants living in the country illegally, without access to official means of filing complaints. The district attorney's office has set up a telephone line that other victims can call to register complaints. Spota emphasized that victims shouldn't be concerned about their immigration status when coming forward.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Long Lines, Suspended Lives: Statistics Reveal Immigration Courts Are Drowning As the heated topic of comprehensive immigration reform once again rears its head in Washington, some who spend their lives working in the trenches are worried. Those who are immersed in the nationâs immigration courts say lawmakers need to focus on not just the creation of new immigration laws, but also on restructuring courts so they can handle millions of potential new cases being added to a system thatâs already bursting at the seams.Statistics reveal a disturbing reality -- that's only getting worse. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a non-partisan think-tank at Syracuse University, there are currently 357,167 cases pending at immigration courts across the nation, an 85 percent hike from just five years ago.Three states could be considered âground zeroâ with the highest number of backlogged cases. California leads the way with 77,378 of those cases, where the average wait-time to get before a judge is around 790 days â thatâs two years and two months. Texas comes in second, with 56,554 pending cases; people there wait an average of 416 days. New York rounds out the top three with 52,332 and an average wait of 598 days.Hereâs something to consider: The majority of these pending cases involve issues ranging from adjudicating applications for deportation, claimed status review proceedings and qualification for benefits and special waivers. They also handle those whoâve been convicted of serious crimes, are considered a threat to the public and are awaiting deportation hearings.âYou have peopleâs lives in your hands,â Dana Leigh Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in an interview. âYou have this tremendous pressure to do the right thing, with the same pressure to work as quickly as possible.âJudge Marks is one of 220 active immigration judges in America; she works in the bustling San Francisco sector. There are 252 slots for judges in the system, but thanks to a U.S. Department of Justice hiring freeze, there are currently 32 vacant positions. Whatâs more, Marks said that roughly 100 of the presiding judges are eligible for retirement this year.âWe have been behind the curve for years,â she said. âAs caseloads nationwide have just been skyrocketing, the number of judges has been decreasing, and we are at a crisis point this year, because we could have a veritable tsunami of retirements.âBut the people really suffering seem to be immigrants and U.S. taxpayers.âWhen you have this kind of an extended wait time, in our opinion, there's this emotional burden that people go through,â said Martin Valko, a prominent immigration attorney at Chavez & Valko in Dallas. âIt's a rollercoaster, because in order to qualify for most common relief in court, you have to meet some stringent criteria.âValko said in an interview that heâs currently representing clients who wonât get before a judge until 2016. He spends much of his time trying to navigate the extremely crowded and complicated system, while doing his best to help those who hire him.âSometimes you do feel rushed, because (judges) feel the pressure of the cases they have assigned to them, but I think, under the circumstances, they're still doing a pretty good job,â Valko said.But insiders, like Valko, see a real irony with the current structure. He points to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency tasked with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants, which shows how much money the federal government is spending to detain undocumented immigrants while they wait to have their cases heard.According to a report released by the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group, it costs on average from $119 to $159 dollars each day to house just one immigrant detainee. On any given day in this country, up to 34,000 detainees are housed in U.S. detention centers. Thatâs between $4 million and $5.4 million every day. Those kind of figures lead many immigration lawyers to argue for alternative, cheaper and more feasible ways to reduce the costs.âThe statistics that I've looked at show 14,000 of those 34,000 are non-criminal individuals,â said Valko. âSo why can't they be taken out and put on an alternative monitoring, such as ankle braces, where it's 10 bucks a day? That would save a couple of million dollars a day.âMost immigration judges and attorneys agree the long-term solution to the problem is to restructure the entire immigration court system, which is actually not within the Homeland Security Department; the Executive Office of Immigration Review is actually still housed in the U.S. Department of Justice, overseeing 59 immigration courts nationwide.Marks supports an overhaul of the system, noting that âIf the immigration courts were restructured in a manner that is more similar to the tax courts, or the bankruptcy courts, there would be more transparency,â Marks said.âFunding would be able to be more directly allocated and be more responsive to the changing caseload needs," she added.The Executive Office of Immigration Review did not provide comment for this article. The agency has a long-standing policy of not allowing sitting immigration judges to comment.

Luis Gutierrez: A Less 'Defensive' Obama Shows Up At Immigration Meeting, Renews Hope Watch the full video interview above or here with Rep. Luis Gutierrez.Rep. Luis Gutierrez told Fox News Latino a less 'combative' and 'defensive' President Barack Obama showed up at a private White House meeting on immigration reform Thursday. This, he said, is giving him hope that Obama will use his power and bypass Congress to stop the record number of deportations processed during his administration.Obama met with Gutierrez and two other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday. The meeting resulted in an announcement that Obama will be directing his homeland security chief to review America's deportation program with the goal of offering more humane ways to enforce the law."It was a great conversation. It reestablished a dialogue," said Gutierrez, a staunch liberal Democrat and a critic of Obama on immigration. "We made abundantly clear to the president the kind of pain and the kind of demand which exists throughout the immigrant communities of this nation for a more humane process when it comes to deportation, the breaking up of families, the children left without parents.""He wasn’t defensive. He wasn’t combative," Gutierrez explained. "He has been in the past, when we’ve raised this issue with him. He spoke to us [about] just how broken his heart is to see this deportation. How he has worked within the confines of the law to alleviate, and that the only way he can fix it in a broad meaningful way is for Congress to act."Gutierrez said he sensed Obama shifted his tone away from saying there is 'nothing more he can do' on immigration reform."I heard a President of the United States that said, 'look this is what I can do,' I’m not going to say there is nothing that I can do'," said Gutierrez, who said the meeting touched on a strategy to passing a comprehensive law.The Illinois Democrat said he and other Latino lawmakers will meet with Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson in about two weeks. Here they will present their 'menu options' or recommendations to help alleviate the deportation problem. One of those options, Gutierrez said, includes the possibly of expanding DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides young undocumented immigrants a two-year work permit and a temporary stay from deportation."There are some technical things that can be done that may seem small, but have huge impacts on people’s lives and there are some larger things that we can do," Gutierrez said in a video interview with Fox News Latino.He then provided a warning to House Republicans, who have not acted on immigration reform."If there is no comprehensive immigration reform, the Republican Party as we know it will cease to exist on a national level," he said. "They'll never be a national party again, the Latino community, the immigrant community won't forgive them."Bryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).

The L Word: Voters call Obama a liar Aug. 16, 2014: President Obama speaks at Community College of Allegheny County West Hills Center.AP**Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**Buzz Cut: • The L Word: Voters call Obama a liar • Who else doesn’t believe Obama? Vladimir Putin • Does Warren have a ‘fighting chance’ against Hillary? • u mad bro? • The name is Cocaine. Edward CocaineADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTTHE L-WORD: VOTERS CALL OBAMA A LIARAs Democrats ramp up a midterm version of President Obama’s successful 2012 divide-and-conquer campaign strategy, a new poll shows the limits to that approach. The latest Fox News poll shows that voters have little trust in the president these days, with 61 percent of respondents saying Obama lies about significant issues “most of the time” or “some of the time.” That includes 38 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents. This survey goes beyond the conventional “honest and trustworthy” measurement common in polls and tests the loaded term “lie.” For so many to say that the president lies is a big deal in a country where trust in government continues to crater. But there’s a more pressing, practical concern for Democrats as they try to cling to a Senate majority. The Obama 2012 strategy relied on using the trust voters placed in him. Obama could vilify his rival and still claim the high ground because American voters were inclined to take him at his word. That redoubt is no longer accessible to him and his party.[Fox News: “…those most likely to say Obama ‘never’ lies to the country on important matters: blacks (37 percent), Democrats (31 percent), liberals (28 percent) and women (19 percent).”]All used up - Given the untruths that Obama has had to admit in the past two years, the numbers shouldn’t be entirely shocking. The president has admitted to lies he would no doubt call virtuous, like denying the existence of large-scale domestic surveillance operations. But he has also been forced to confess to repeatedly misleading voters about his health law (“If you like your health plan…). Even after trying to come clean, Obama was repeatedly called out for inflating ObamaCare enrollment numbers. Most recently, he and his team got busted using phony numbers to attack Republicans on gender pay. But the “lie of the year” on ObamaCare is the big one. It is unlikely that Obama would have gotten re-elected had he told the whole truth about looming insurance cancellations and doctor disruptions under his law. Safely returned to office, Obama could ‘fess up and there was little voters could do… to him at least. To the members of his party, though, there appears to be a serious price to be paid in November.[Obama teams up with insurance execs - The Hill: “President Obama is scheduled to meet with health insurance executives and state insurance commissioners on Thursday, just two days after ObamaCare's special enrollment period officially closed.  …The announcement of new enrollment figures was also expected separately on Thursday.  It is possible Obama could reveal the numbers before one of the two meetings.”]WHO ELSE DOESN’T BELIEVE OBAMA? VLADIMIR PUTINReuters: “Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine's leaders… of committing a ‘grave crime’ by using the army to try to quell unrest in the east of the country, and did not rule out sending in Russian troops… The Kremlin chief said: ‘I really hope that I do not have to exercise this right and that we are able to solve all today's pressing issues via political and diplomatic means.’” Putin’s charge came as talks between Ukraine, Russia, the U.S., and the European Union continued in Geneva.Major buzz kill, dude - In an interview Wednesday, President Obama claimed Russian military moves like the buzzing of a U.S. warship by Russian jets this week. Asked in an interview by CBS’s Major Garrett if he thought Putin was mocking him and the U.S. military, the president was dismissive. “They’re not interested in any kind of military confrontation with us, understanding that— our conventional forces are significantly superior to the Russians” he said.MORE THAN 15,000 FEDS MADE OVER 200 GRAND LAST YEARNational Journal: “Most of the discussion of pay for federal employees in recent months and years has been about insufficient or non-existent raises, pay gaps and budget shortfalls. Not all feds are making out so poorly, however. A new database compiled by FedSmith.com, using data from the Office of Personnel Management and other agencies, shows more than 15,000 federal employees earned at least $200,000 in 2013. That's roughly 1 percent of all federal workers on the list; some employees in national security positions were not included in the database.”WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...The Atlantic’s Julie Beck takes us outside out comfort zones as she considers The Private Lives of Public Bathrooms: “Until the 1800’s, there was little expectation of privacy while using the bathroom. Economic prosperity and religious notions of modesty made the desire for a private space in which to do one’s business more widespread. Today, most people living in developed countries expect privacy in the bathroom. Paradoxically, most bathrooms outside of private homes are designed for multiple, simultaneous occupants.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., “A Fighting Chance,” the Boston Globe describes Warren’s back and forth with the big wigs of D.C. “Throughout the book, Warren casts herself as the dutiful outsider, persistently fighting the corruption and excess of Wall Street and battling to do the right thing in a capital filled with self-dealers and well-connected insiders. She also interweaves personal details, writing how she engaged in national policy debates while having nightly conversations with her pregnant daughter, or of running a high-profile campaign while dealing with the emotional toll of her ailing dog, Otis.” Warren had been on the job just one day before she bossed former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner like a “third-grade teacher” to wear a seat belt in a high profile SUV.Trumka sounds ready for Warren - National Journal: “Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of labor unions, may be the most visible union leader in the country. And he’s certainly not shy about sharing his political opinions. In a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session, one user asked Trumka for his thoughts on Sen.

But secret recordings obtained by the liberal magazine Mother Jones threaten to blemish her image before it’s even fully established. In candid conversations with her closest political aides that were published Wednesday, [Gov. Susana Martinez, R-N.M.,] dubs her 2010 Democratic opponent ‘that little bitch,’ complains that teachers ‘already don’t work … 2 1/2 months out of the year’”Team Martinez responds -  “Today, an extreme left-wing blog posted four-year-old material from private conversations undoubtedly sent to them by individuals or their allies who are either under federal indictment, or have had their homes raided by the FBI for their role in stealing or distributing Governor Susana Martinez’s email. That the national Left is trying to smear the first Hispanic woman governor in American history because they view her as a threat is about as surprising as the National Enquirer reporting that Elvis is still alive. Yes, the Governor used salty language in a private conversation four years ago with close advisers and will pay the appropriate penalty to the cuss jar. Governor Martinez will not be distracted by cheap political attacks and will remain focused on continuing to move New Mexico forward” [Byron York’s take. In the end, did the Mother Jones story tell us much of anything about Susana Martinez? Well, it showed Martinez probably does make pretty large deposits in the cuss jar. Beyond that, it seems unlikely to have much of any effect on the governor of New Mexico or her future.]CRUZ BACKS SHANNON IN OKLAHOMA SHOWDOWNBreitbart: “Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) endorsed conservative Oklahoma Senate candidate T.W. Shannon on Wednesday… ‘T.W. Shannon is a strong Constitutional conservative who will fight for individual liberty and help turn our country around,’ Cruz said of his first endorsement of an open Senate seat in the 2014 midterm cycle. ‘T.W. embodies the American dream. I’m proud to offer T.W. my enthusiastic endorsement because not only will he vote the right way, but he’ll stand up and fight with us in the Senate to stop President Obama’s assault on our liberties and defend America’s founding principles.’ Shannon, considered the most conservative House Speaker in the history of the country's reddest state, closed a 35-point deficit in the polls to single digits in a poll taken days after [former Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin's] endorsement. The Senate Conservatives Fund and Mark Levin have since endorsed him along with[Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah,] over Rep. James Lankford (R-OK), who has been accused of being cozy with the Republican leadership in Congress, in the race to replace retiring Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK).”NEBRASKA PRIMARY TURNS UGLIERNebraska’s Republican Senate primary has taken another nasty turn. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that just one day after frontrunner Shane Osborn took his attacks against top rival Ben Sasse to the airwaves in a spot trashing Sasse’s time as a health-insurance policy wonk in Bush administration, a Sasse-backed political-action committee launched a counterattack ad today highlighting the support to Osborn’s campaign from lobbyists aligned with the GOP Senate leadership. Three more weeks of nastiness before the primary might not be enough to put the Republican-held seat in play for the general election, but the presumptive Democratic nominee, deep-pocketed trial lawyer Dave Domina, is surely hoping that Osborn is ready with a counter-counterattack.MANCHIN: ‘TWO GOOD CANDIDATES’ IN W.VA. SENATE RACEPolitico: “[Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.] supports Democrat Natalie Tennant in her run to replace the retiring West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller but questioned whether it is ‘morally right’ to ‘beat up’ on Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito in that race.

Mark Warner, D-Va.] unchallenged for the Democratic nomination as he seeks re-election, played up his bipartisan bona fides before a largely Republican crowd in a nine-minute keynote address from the main stage at the event sponsored by the Wakefield Ruritan Club… He was politely received, minus a few hecklers. Warner ignored one who asked why he voted for President Barack Obama’s agenda 97 percent of the time; moments later he sidestepped a reporter’s question on whether he will campaign with Obama this year...”KIRK SWINGS IN BEHIND GOP SENATE CANDIDATE WJBC: “U.S. Sen. Mark S. Kirk (R-Ill.) is throwing his support behind Republican Senate candidate Jim Oberweis. Kirk said a month ago that he would not campaign for Oberweis, in order to protect his working relationship with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). ‘I will be campaigning for Jim Oberweis,’ he said on Tuesday….Durbin says the turnaround by Kirk is news to him. ‘He said he wasn’t going to campaign against me,’ Durbin said. ‘I called him and thanked him, and that’s where we left the conversation in Washington.’ Durbin is seeking a fourth term in the Senate. Oberweis ran for the Senate in 2002 and 2004, but lost the Republican primary both times. He is the Republican nominee this time.”DAINES HITS ‘RICH ENVIRONMENTALISTS’Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., is touting his success in fighting “rich environmentalists who tried locking up our land and our natural resources” in a new ad in his bid to beat Sen. John Walsh, D-Mont. Walsh was appointed to serve out the term of Max Baucus, the longtime Democratic Senator who left ahead of his retirement for a gig as U.S. ambassador to China. Daines’s ad echoes a growing Republican counterattack this year against Democratic patrons, like green-energy billionaire Tom Steyer.[The Missoulian reports that former Lt. Gov. Walsh is facing a rockier road in his party’s June 3 primary. “Democrat Dirk Adams, a Wilsall rancher and attorney who’s one of two people challenging Walsh for the Democratic nomination, reported this week he has put an additional $205,000 of his own money into his campaign.”]McConnell digs coal - A political action committee backing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell comes out swinging on the Obama administration’s global warming policies in a new spot in the coal-rich commonwealth.PICK SIXRepublicans need six more Senate seats to take control of the upper chamber.

Cantor offered a public statement, called a “readout” by press flacks, akin to those offered by feuding world leaders after telephone calls. The White House expressed surprise saying it was just a friendly phone call wishing Cantor a happy Passover. But knowing how often the president and his political team have used immigration as a wedge issue against Republicans, the White House response sounded about as real as Easter grass.Obama still talking about immigration - On “CBS This Morning” President Obama blames Congress for the inability to act and hopes once the primary season is over, Washington will “do the right thing” with an immigration policy. “I think it is very important for Congress to recognize that this is going to be an issue that haunts them until it gets solved.

Marathon bombing suspect seeks to strike 'betrayal' of US as argument for death penalty BOSTON –  Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv) say federal prosecutors shouldn't be allowed to use his status as a new American citizen to argue that his alleged "betrayal" of the United States is one reason he should be put to death.A defense filing Thursday says prosecutors are trying to use Tsarnaev's foreign birth and immigration history against him. They say citing his status as a newly naturalized U.S. citizen implies he is "more deserving of the death penalty" than a native-born person who commits the same crime.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTTsarnaev is awaiting trial in the 2013 marathon bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260.He lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in Russia before moving to the U.S. at age 8. 
Mark Zuckerberg Lobby Group On Immigration Reform: GOP, 'We've Waited Long Enough' The prognosis for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill was looking grimmer and grimmer this year as GOP leaders in the House said its members were simply too “distrustful” of President Barack Obama to approve of such a sweeping measure.The final nail in the reform coffin seemed to be hammered in by no less than the House speaker himself, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio.But immigration advocates continue pushing for reform – in recent weeks doing everything to keep the pressure, from holding hunger strikes in front of immigration detention facilities to riding a bicycle on Sunday 1,000 miles from Florida to Washington D.C., to targeting political candidates running for office in November and warning them that their stance on the emotionally-charged issue will be remembered by Latinos when they cast their votes.The latest salvo comes from an advocacy group affiliated with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that launched a nationwide ad on Monday that implores House Republicans to act this election year on legislation overhauling the nation's immigration system."Why are House Republicans cooling, retreating and even privately saying they'd rather do nothing this year?" the 60-second spot asks, then adds, "Nothing won't do. Call House Republicans today. Tell them we've waited long enough, pass immigration reform."The commercial comes as rank-and-file House Republicans are reluctant to tackle the divisive issue in the months leading up to the midterm congressional elections, wary that a high-profile fight will undercut their upbeat prospects for increasing their majority in the House and seizing control of the Senate.House GOP leaders unveiled a set of principles on immigration in January, but the optimism among advocates was dashed when Boehner blamed GOP distrust of President Barack Obama for the House's inability to move forward on legislation.The new commercial is slated to run in all 50 states at a cost of $500,000. Council for American Job Growth, an affiliate of the group FWD.us, is sponsoring the ad. Zuckerberg launched the advocacy group FWD.us with the support of Silicon Valley titans such as Bill Gates and Sean Parker and the organization has been one of the most active on the immigration issue."The future of this country, our country, is tied to immigration reform," says the spot, which warns of stagnant job growth and loss of tax revenue if Congress fails to act.The role of the likes of Zuckerberg, who has identified himself in the past as Republican-leaning, and other business heavy hitters insinuates an important dimension in to the immigration reform debate, observers say.“If reform is going to have any chance, it will require center right GOP-aligned groups – like tech interests, agriculture interests, the business community – to step up and put real pressure on Republicans to act,” said an editorial in The Washington Post.Earlier this year, the advocacy group “Fast for Families Across America” launched a campaign that entails visits to more than 100 congressional districts.Last week, the group embarked on a two-bus nationwide tour. It involves stopping at more than 75 districts with daily events calling for congressional action on immigration reform. The two buses are expected to meet in Washington D.C. in April.“Fast for Families” gained national attention in November when its leaders held a hunger strike on the National Mall for 22 days, during which they camped out in white tents.An unusual coalition of business groups, labor and religious organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the nation's Catholic bishops, has pressed for immigration legislation with little signs of progress in the House.The Senate passed a comprehensive bill last June that would provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, tighten border security and add new visa and workplace enforcement programs. The legislation has stalled in the House where Republicans have rejected a comprehensive approach in favor of piecemeal legislation. The House, however, hasn't voted on any of the individual bills passed by the Judiciary Committee last year.Those who want a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants stress, however, that Republican conservatives are not the only one to blame for the continuing flawed system.They increasingly have targeted Obama, too, noting that a record number of deportations have occurred since he’s been president. They call him “Deporter-in-Chief.”"We know the President has the ability to expand relief and its unfathomable why he continues to deport the very people he says he wants to see included in reform,” said Pablo Alvarado, executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, or NDLON, in a statement to Fox News Latino.“It has been the bold organizing, risk, and sacrifices of immigrants that put immigration on the national agenda," Alvarado said. "There is a galvanized consensus that the President needs to act. It's concrete and clear and could happen immediately. What he did for immigrant youth with deferred action he can do for the broader undocumented community."The Associated Press contributed to this story.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Matthew Kolken: The Untenable Cost Of Doing Nothing On Immigration Reform This past week House Democrats introduced a discharge petition, which if successful would force a vote on previously stalled immigration reform legislation. Most acknowledge that the strategy has been employed for the singular purpose of shaming House Republicans for their inaction on immigration reform, and has virtually no chance of success. In sum, Democrats are engaging in thinly veiled political gamesmanship motivated by the desire to score points in advance of the midterm elections. Most see through the charade. - Matthew KolkenCristina Jiménez, Managing Director of UnitedWeDream.org, the nation’s first and largest national immigrant youth-led organization, has outspokenly scolded House Democrats for chasing rainbows while refusing to press President Obama to stop his record deportations. Ms. Jiménez observed that this is nothing more than a distraction, stating “political maneuvers like the House Democrats' discharge petition are just getting in the way.”  Immigrant activist Erica Andiola of the DRM Action Coalition agrees, commenting that it is unconscionable to use the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants for political gain. Both agree that President Obama’s two million deportations have created a human rights crisis of epic proportions, demanding immediate action by the Executive Branch. They explain that the immigrant community can no longer wait for the Republicans in Congress to get their act together.The Immigration Policy Center’s Walter A. Ewing brings credence to their argument, acknowledging the hypocrisy of the Obama Presidency in a report tracking the growth of the U.S. deportation machine. He points to the administration’s conscious expansion of detention and deportation as a major point of contention, reflecting that "rather than putting the brakes on this non-stop drive to deport more and more people, the administration chose to add fuel to the fire."The Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project has also chimed in releasing a report that found that the deportation machine has been fed by a vast increase in federal criminal prosecutions for immigration related crimes, which has changed the landscape for Federal prosecutors. It did not go unnoticed that at 48 percent, Hispanics make up the bulk of those prosecutions. Meanwhile, Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) sifted through the numbers finding that in 2013 there were nearly 100,000 prosecutions for immigration related crimes, an all-time high. TRAC determined that new prosecutions were filed against 97,384 defendants, a 5.9 percent increase from 2012, and a 22.6 percent increase over the past 5 years, resulting in a 76 percent increase in federal criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry since President Obama took office. What this translates to is that the Obama administration has made a strategic decision to turn an unprecedented number of immigrants into convicted criminals when their only criminal infraction stems from an immigration law violation. In sum, they have been found guilty for doing everything in their power to try to get back to their family. This policy change has resulted in a padding of the criminal removal statistics that the administration touts in an effort to deflect scrutiny from their 2 million deportations. And at what cost?Customs and Border Protections’ Fiscal Year 2013 budget was $11.9 billion. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s budget was increased to $5.9 billion. Another $2.9 billion was spent by Enforcement and Removal Operations in FY 2012. That’s not pocket change.It is time to acknowledge that tax paying American citizens can no longer afford to continue writing checks to fund an out of control deportation machine that is disproportionately targeting people of color. Especially since passing immigration reform will actually save the country money. The Congressional Budget Office determined that immigration reform will result in almost a trillion dollar reduction of the nation’s deficit during the next two decades in addition to yielding long term benefits to American workers and the economy. Now we are speaking a language that even the most partisan Republican can understand.Case in point, perennial budget hawk Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has recently acknowledged the inevitability of immigration reform stating reform is a question of when, not if. The problem he notes is that there aren’t enough Republican votes to reach a consensus on the issue. The clock is ticking, Congressman.In fact, the time has long passed for hyper-partisans on both sides of the aisle to put down their midterm elections swords. Americans are tired of excuses and gamesmanship. Doing nothing to address our immigration crisis to score political points is simply an untenable strategy that is emptying our nation’s coffers while destroying families. It is a strategy that must be abandoned in favor of the adoption of common sense solutions.  Matthew L. Kolken is an immigration attorney and a national immigration reform advocate.

Meet the new face of immigration reform Define American/YoutubeAdriana Garcia, 21, is about to become a very unusual poster girl for immigration reform.Beginning this week Ms. Garcia and the American flag appear in an on-line advertisement for immigration reform called “The Pledge.”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTGarcia is one of more than a dozen undocumented young people appearing in the advertisement and holding up their hands as they say the pledge of allegiance to the U.S. flag.Since she left Mexico and arrived in Arizona at age 10 Ms. Garcia has put her hand over heart every day in school and pledged allegiance “to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”Garcia is not a U.S. citizen. The only reason she can show her face without fear of trouble is because President Obama ordered federal immigration authorities not to deport “Dreamers,” high school and college students who lack legal immigration status.She calls the U.S. her country and she calls the American flag her flag.But her American identity has no legal standing. Her parents, who have been in Arizona since the early 1990s, don’t have any legal status at all.None of the other young people in the on-line advertisements are American citizens. But all of them grew up in the U.S. happily pledging their oath to the red, white and blue flag of a country they call home.But they have been ignored failed to move immigration reform under President Bush, a Republican, and President Obama, a Democrat.Garcia, a junior marketing major at Grand Canyon State University who worked as a congressional intern this year, agreed to appear in the advertisement to reach out to American citizens and ask them to insist Congress take immediate action on reforming the immigration broken immigration system. The symbol in the ad is an open hand of the kind lift to their hearts when they recite the pledge of allegiance.“The immigration rights movement doesn’t have a symbol,” said Jose Antonio Vargas, another undocumented immigrant who has been saying the pledge of allegiance since he was 12. Now 32 he has written for several American newspapers, won a Pulitzer Prize, and founded the pro-immigration reform group ‘Define American.’ His feature length documentary on his life as a child without citizenship papers will debut on television next year.But he still lacks citizenship.“We want the symbol of the pledge hand to unify U.S. citizens and undocumented people in the fight for immigration reform,” said Vargas. “Looking at American history we know that in the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, and the gay rights movement it was crucial to attract allies from all parts of American life. Those movements took off when everyone got involved.”Garcia, a Girl Scout, has two sisters, 13 and 9, who are citizens because they were born in the U.S.“I hope people who don’t feel involved with immigration reform take a look at the video and see themselves in a group of all-around American young people who say the pledge but don’t have citizenship,” said Garcia. “If they get involved it will strengthen the movement.”The only hope remaining for the immigration reform movement is that the House of Representatives will take up the issue in early 2014 before mid-term elections. The Senate passed an immigration bill last summer but the House has taken no action.Once 2014 primary campaigns begin in Republican congressional districts it will be difficult, if not impossible, for Republican Congressmen to support any reforms without fear of being attacked by GOP primary opponents as soft on criminals.But this Christmas the happy, welcome symbol of an open hand  -- ready to pledge allegiance with other Americans – is Ms. Garcia’s gift to efforts to bring all Americans together and get the House to finally to take action on immigration reform.Juan Williams joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 as a contributor and is also a co-host of FNC's "The Five," where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

Mexican activist Elvira Arellano freed in San Diego Mexican activist Elvira Arellano, who holed up in a Chicago church for more than a year to avoid deportation, was freed here two days after giving herself up to U.S. immigration authorities.Arellano and infant son Emiliano were paroled and their case will be decided by an immigration court, authorities said.Her other son, 15-year-old U.S. citizen Saul, spent only a few hours in custody.Moved to tears, Elvira Arellano told Efe minutes after being released that she hopes this is "the start" of other families being freed that crossed the border with her through California's Otay Mesa Port of Entry."We're going to keep up the pressure so they are all released," Arellano said, noting that her "commitment is very great because I'm so grateful for everyone standing by me and for this movement that opened the way for me to go home."Arellano, TIME magazine's Person of the Year in 2006, acknowledged that once detained, she was afraid she could never rejoin her loved ones."I was really nervous, and yes I was scared, but fortunately it all turned out fine," Arellano said.The activist and defender of human rights confessed to being afraid "they would send me to federal prison because I had a previous deportation."Saul said he was happy to be with his mother again and believes that what she did will "set a precedent in the struggle for immigration reform that will stop the deportations that break up families.""This is something big, a person who has spent her life fighting for the undocumented is set free," Saul said.Arellano was deported from the United States in August 2007, shortly after she left the Chicago church that sheltered her from immigration authorities seeking to enforce a 2002 deportation order.EFE 
Mexican activist joins anti-deportation protest in Chicago Mexican activist Elvira Arellano, who once holed up in a Chicago church for more than a year to avoid deportation, took part here Thursday in her first protest since being re-admitted to the United States on humanitarian parole.Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) also participated in the march and rally in Chicago's Federal Plaza.The lawmaker, an outspoken proponent of immigration reform, said that if the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has not acted on the issue by July, President Barack Obama would have to begin signing executive orders to protect more undocumented migrants from deportation.Specifically, Gutierrez told Efe, the president should bar the deportation of parents of undocumented youths who qualify for Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.Obama should also extend protection from deportation to undocumented migrants with U.S.-born children, the congressman said.Arellano - TIME magazine's Person of the Year in 2006 - was deported from the United States in August 2007, shortly after she left the Chicago church that sheltered her from immigration authorities seeking to enforce a 2002 deportation order.She returned to the country earlier this month as part of a large group affiliated with the Bring Them Home movement.The activist and her two sons, 15-year-old U.S. citizen Saul and infant Emiliano, who was born in Mexico, passed through California's Otay Mesa Port of Entry.Saul was freed within hours, while Arellano and the baby spent two days in custody before their release on humanitarian parole.A judge will decide on Arellano's request for asylum in the United States.For the moment, she and her sons are living at Adalberto United Methodist Church, where Arellano found sanctuary from deportation eight years ago.

Mexico's Diego Luna brings film on Cesar Chavez to White House Mexican actor and director Diego Luna on Wednesday screened his film "Cesar Chavez," a biographical work about the late Hispanic union leader, at a private showing at the White House hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama.Also attending the showing were the film's two starring actresses: America Ferrera and Rosario Dawson.Obama could not remain for the showing, but he promised to watch it "this weekend," given that, he said, it will be "very lonely" for a few days in the White House because first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha have departed on a trip to China.The president called Cesar Chavez an "American hero" who during the 1960s launched the fight for Latino workers' rights and founded the United Farm Workers, and he went on to say that the labor leader "organized others to widen the circle of opportunity not just for the people he knew, but for future generations."Chavez (1927-1993) was a man who "devoted this brief time that we have on Earth to making sure that this country lived up to some of its lofty ideals," the president added.Obama said that one of the "great lessons" of the life of the labor leader is "You don't give up the fight no matter how long it takes. No matter how long the odds, you keep going, fueled by a simple creed: si, se puede (Yes, we can).""We've got a lot of causes that are worth fighting for," said the president, citing his ongoing push for immigration reform, guaranteeing adequate and accessible health care for all Americans and ensuring fair wages on the principle of "equal pay for equal work."Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the granddaughter of the late activist and a staff member at the White House, was tasked with introducing the president before he gave his remarks."Cesar Chavez," the second fiction feature film to be directed by Luna, will begin showing in theaters on March 28.At the recent Berlinale film festival, the work was screened outside the competition and could also be seen for several days at the South by Southwest festival held in Austin, Texas, where it received the Audience Award.Actor Michael Peña, whose parents were born in Mexico, plays Chavez, while Ferrera stars as his wife, Helen, and Dawson plays Dolores Huerta.Chavez "was someone who was disgusted by injustices; the farmworkers of the period worked 16 hours a day, they didn't do anything but work, they couldn't eat or go to the bathroom," Peña told Efe during the Austin festival.Meanwhile, Luna said that what made Chavez a great leader was that he knew how to listen: "He's a man who understood what this community needed, that that was fair, to be listened to ... He told the farmworkers that their stories were important." EFE 
Mexico rescues 44 Guatemalan migrants held by Guatemalan traffickers MEXICO CITY –  Mexican authorities have freed 44 Guatemalan migrants who were being held in captivity by a band of six human traffickers.The migrants found at a safe house near the Guatemalan border include seven women and two boys, and are being held pending their return to Guatemala.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTMexico's National Immigration Institute said Thursday that the six Guatemalan smugglers were also caught and are being held pending human trafficking charges.The institute said the gang transported migrants from Guatemala to the United States.Smugglers frequently hold migrants to extort more money from their relatives. 
Moroccan national accused of plot to use drones to fly bombs into Conn. school BRIDGEPORT, Conn. –  FBI officials say they've arrested a Moroccan national in Connecticut in an alleged plot to fly bombs on drone-like devices into a school and a federal building.Authorities say they arrested 27-year-old El Mehdi Semlali Fahti on Monday and found wires and tools in his Bridgeport apartment. The Connecticut Post first reported the arrest.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTFahti hasn't been charged with terrorism, but authorities say that could come later in the investigation. He's charged with immigration-related crimes for allegedly staying in the U.S. for seven years after his student visa expired after flunking out of Virginia International University.The FBI says Fahti targeted an out-of-state school and a federal building in Connecticut. The exact locations weren't released.Fahti is detained without bail. His public defender declined to comment Tuesday. 
Nearly Half Of Country's Immigration Judges Are Eligible For Retirement In 2014 MIAMI (AP) –  The nation's already backlogged immigration courts might soon be thrown into more havoc as roughly half of their 220 judges will be eligible for retirement next year.The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the nation's 59 immigration courts, says the court already has 32 vacancies, contributing to the current backlog of nearly 350,000 cases. Judges are overwhelmed, and immigrants with legitimate asylum claims can spend years in legal limbo.Meanwhile, immigrants without legitimate legal claims remain in the country, while Americans foot the bill for them to be locked up longer.The Executive Office says its average retirement rate is only 5 percent per year — which would mean 11 judges retiring in 2014. But Judge Dana Leigh Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, fears increasingly difficult conditions are likely to push many to retire at the earliest opportunity."We are the forgotten stepchild. When Congress wants to fund immigration enforcement, they forget about the court," Marks said.She said it takes months to vet judicial appointees and even longer for judges to get up to speed.Congress has aggressively boosted funding for immigration enforcement and detention, with the Obama administration deporting some 360,000 people last year. Yet, the courts have seen few additional resources. That's even as caseloads have jumped 15 percent since 2011, according to Executive Office for Immigration Review Director Juan Osuna, who testified before a congressional subcommittee.As far back as 2008, a Georgetown Immigration Law Journal article surveying immigration judges found they exhibited more burnout "than prison wardens and physicians in busy hospitals." The judges blamed the stress on the pressure to adjudicate so many cases — and decide the fate of so many lives — in such little time.Unlike other federal judges, immigration judges fall under the U.S. Department of Justice and are employees of the executive branch, not the judicial branch. Their caseload varies. In Honolulu, two immigration judges currently each have about 100 cases, while six judges in Houston have about 6,000 cases each, according to the nonprofit federal data tracker, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.Immigration judges have no bailiff, no court reporter and aren't guaranteed a court clerk. And while a federal judge might lean on three law clerks to help with 400 or so complaints, three immigration judges generally split one law clerk for an average of 1,500 cases.Immigration judges also shoulder a much greater share of the legal research than other judges because 60 percent of those who come before their bench cannot afford an attorney.Brookings Institute Fellow Russell Wheeler said the delays create additional expense for taxpayers because individuals can spend more time behind bars waiting for their cases to be resolved at a cost of about $160 per night.Not everyone wants more judges, though. The lag time allows those without legitimate legal claims to remain in the country longer, and some immigrants hope if they can fight deportation long enough, Congress will eventually provide them some form of amnesty. Others marry a U.S. citizen while waiting for their cases to be heard.Miami immigration attorney Hector Diaz accompanied his client to immigration court this month in Miami. The client, who is in the country illegally, is fighting a deportation order he received after he was stopped for driving with an expired license.Diaz argues his client's removal would cause extreme hardship for the man's mother, a U.S. citizen, but Diaz acknowledges it's a tough case to win."So it does benefit them to have the cases pushed back," he said.Judge Marks said while some benefit from the delays, it's often those with the strongest cases who lose out because memories fade and witnesses supporting their case become less reliable or available over time.The Senate passed immigration legislation in June that allocates more money for the immigration courts and called for 225 new judges, as well as an equal number of support staff, over the next three years. But House Speaker John Boehner has said his chamber will not take up that bill nor address a similar one introduced by House Democrats.The president's 2014 budget calls for 30 new immigration judge teams to address the backlog as well as other efforts to help the courts, but the stalemate in Congress makes it less likely the improvements will happen.Immigration attorney Ira Kurzban, author of the industry standard, "Kurzban' s Immigration Law Sourcebook," said while many in Congress complain about deportation proceedings, they have failed to provide the necessary resources for sufficient judges to allow the system to function properly."Doing so would allow those people who should be here legally to get their legal status, and those who have no legal claim to be here would presumably be deported," he said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Nebraska town enforces ban on renting to undocumented migrants After almost four years of legal battles, a Nebraska town - starting on Thursday - will enforce a municipal ordinance requiring that anyone who wants to rent a home must prove that they are in the country legally.Ordinance 5165, approved by Fremont voters in a 2010 referendum, prohibited hiring or renting to people who can't prove their legal immigration status.The measure also required local businesses to use the federal government's E-verify system to confirm that job applicants are authorized to work in the country.On Feb. 28, 2012, U.S. District Judge Laurie Smith Camp found that the portions of 5165 pertaining to housing were discriminatory and in conflict with federal law and she issued an injunction blocking the enforcement of those provisions.Last June, however, two of the three judges on a panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion, overturning Camp's decision and lifting the injunction.The ordinance's employment provisions had entered into force earlier.Authorities in Fremont can now enforce the rules requiring would-be renters to show proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residence.Ordinance 5165 will not affect people who are already renting housing in the town, Fremont police chief Jeff Elliott said Wednesday.The requirement to prove one's legal residence in the country to be able to rent housing, he said, will only be enforced on would-be renters starting on Thursday.To prove one's legal status, everyone who will be living in the same home must receive an occupancy license from the police.The form adult applicants must fill out asks for detailed information about them, as well as about each of the children who will be sharing the home.In addition, the procedure includes signing a sworn declaration that specifies that the applicant is a U.S. citizen. If they are not, they will be asked to present the proper documentation to prove that they are in the country legally.Census figures show that Latinos account for just under 12 percent of Fremont's roughly 26,000 residents. Forty percent of the town's Hispanic residents are U.S. citizens. EFE 
Midwest Town Formerly Nucleus Of Nation's Immigration Debate Ponders Its Future FREMONT, Neb. (AP) –  Residents of a small Nebraska city are getting a second chance to decide whether they want to remain at the forefront of the immigration debate.Voters in Fremont will decide Tuesday whether to repeal an ordinance they enacted in 2010 that requires all renters to swear they have legal permission to live in the U.S. Critics say the rule is less effective and more costly than anyone expected and is damaging the city's image. Supporters say Fremont needs to take a stand against illegal immigration.The conservative agricultural hub near Omaha, population 26,000, is one of a handful of cities that have acted on their own over the last decade to curb illegal immigration. Most of those efforts have become mired in costly court battles.The same is true in Fremont, where the regulations were adopted in 2010 but put on hold while courts reviewed the law. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld most of the ordinance in 2013, and the city was getting ready to enforce the housing restrictions for the first time last fall when elected officials decided to schedule another vote.Critics say these housing restrictions will be ineffective and might cost Fremont millions of dollars in legal fees and lost federal grants. But supporters see no reason not to enforce the law and take a stand against illegal immigration, now that courts have approved the rules."I don't think we should be re-voting on something that the voters already voted on in 2010," said lifelong Fremont resident Brad Yerger. The 66-year-old is skeptical that the ordinance will cost as much as officials estimate.Opponents of the housing restrictions say they have hurt the city's reputation without accomplishing much."Most people agree we need to change our federal immigration system. This ordinance doesn't address that," Virginia Meyer said while taking a break from distributing roughly 500 yard signs encouraging people to vote against the rules.Supporters insist the measure does not target Hispanics, but the topic can make for awkward conversation given Fremont's growing immigrant population. The number of Hispanics jumped from 165 in 1990 to 1,085 in 2000 and 3,149 in 2010, mostly because of jobs at the nearby Hormel and Fremont Beef plants.The law passed with 57 percent of the vote. The key to Tuesday's outcome will be how many people have changed their minds and whether turnout surpasses the 6,916 people who cast ballots last time."I don't think it's so much that people have shifted (since 2010) as much as they are more aware of the issues," said Krista Anderson, who also campaigned against the original ordinance.The town's small liberal arts university could be another factor. For this vote, Midland University's professors and 1,300 students will be on campus. The last vote took place during the school's summer break.If the housing restrictions take effect, City Council members are worried about additional lawsuits. And the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development warned last year that Fremont could lose community-development grants that have been worth $7.1 million over the past 15 years.In their attempt to crack down on illegal immigration, Fremont and the other cities sought to ban hiring or renting to anyone who is in the country illegally. Most of those rules became stalled in court, with communities such as Hazelton, Pa., and Farmers Branch, Texas, racking up big legal bills.Fremont was thrust into the national spotlight partly because it acted shortly after Arizona's strict immigration law made headlines.A couple of other cities, such as Valley Park in Missouri, have modified or abandoned ordinances in the face of court challenges and dissent, as Fremont is considering.In Congress, similar issues have halted immigration reform. A Senate-passed bill appears to be dead in the House, where conservatives cite a changing series of reasons for not wanting to act. House Speaker John Boehner has all but ruled out passage of immigration legislation before the fall elections.It's not clear how many people live in Fremont illegally. According to census figures, the town is home to 1,150 noncitizens. That figure includes immigrants who do not have permission to be in the U.S., as well as lawful permanent residents, foreign students and refugees who are legally in the U.S.Tuesday's vote in Fremont will not affect provisions of the ordinance requiring employers to use a federal online system to check whether prospective employees are permitted to work in the U.S. That part of the law has been in place since 2012, and larger employers were already using it.The housing rules require anyone who rents a home or apartment to apply for a $5 permit and attest to their legal status, but there is no mandate to show proof. New permits are needed for every move.The ordinance would also require landlords to make sure their tenants have permits or face a $100 fine.After the vote, civil rights groups that have challenged the ordinance will decide whether to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the issue.Business leaders say the ordinance has given Fremont a troubling image of intolerance that makes it harder to attract new companies."Professionally," said Ron Tillery, executive director of the Fremont Area Chamber of Commerce, "I've had very few conversations with people who see this as a positive.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Archbishop Timothy Dolan Presses House On Immigration (AP) –  Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, is pressuring the House to act on immigration legislation before the end of the year, calling the issue "a matter of great moral urgency" that cannot wait in a letter to Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Thursday.- Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New YorkDolan, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, expressed he was troubled by reports that immigration reform is delayed in the House since lawmakers have a responsibility to resolve the issue. Writing on behalf of the 450-plus U.S. cardinals and bishops, Dolan said they respectfully request that the House address the immigration issue as soon as possible.The Senate passed a bill in June that would provide a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally and tighten border security, but the measure has stalled in the House where Boehner and GOP leaders have argued for a piecemeal approach."As a moral matter ... our nation cannot continue to receive the benefits of the work and contributions of undocumented immigrants without extending to them the protection of the law," Dolan wrote. "Keeping these human beings as a permanent underclass of workers who are unable to assert their rights or enjoy the fruits of their labor is a stain on the soul of the nation."Dolan reiterated the bishops' stand that immigration legislation includes a path to citizenship, reaffirms family reunification, deals with future flows of migrant workers and restores basic due process protections to immigrants.He wrote Boehner, a Catholic, that immigration is "a challenge that has confounded our nation for years, with little action from our federally elected officials. It is a matter of great moral urgency that cannot wait any longer for action."The House has just a few legislative days left in the year, and prospects for any legislation are murky.Responding to Dolan's letter, Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, said the speaker "has been very clear that he supports common-sense, step-by-step reforms to fix our broken immigration system."Most House Republicans reject a comprehensive approach as well as the Senate bill, with many questioning the offer of citizenship to people who broke U.S. immigration laws to be in this country. The House Judiciary Committee has moved forward with individual, single-issue immigration bills.Although House Republican leaders say they want to resolve the issue, which has become a political drag for the GOP, many rank-and-file House Republicans have shown little inclination to deal with it. The bitter standoff with President Barack Obama on the budget and near default further angered House Republicans, who have resisted any move that might give Obama an immigration overhaul, the top item on his second-term domestic agenda.Numerous House Republicans also are wary of passing any immigration legislation that would set up a conference with the Senate, fearing that they would lose out in final negotiations.The Senate bill, strongly backed by the White House, includes billions for border security, a reworked legal immigration system to allow tens of thousands of high- and low-skilled workers into the country and a 13-year path to citizenship for those living here illegally.Based on reporting by the Associated Press. 
New York court hears arguments over roles of Ashcroft and Mueller in 9/11 detentions NEW YORK –  A federal appeals court is considering whether former Attorney General John Ashcroft and former FBI Director Robert Mueller can still be sued over alleged abuses of Muslim and Arab men detained in the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard arguments Thursday in an appeal of a judge's decision to dismiss the claims against Ashcroft and Mueller.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe plaintiffs allege in a lawsuit that the pair had the FBI oversee a program to detain the men on immigration violations and then pressure them into cooperating.Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim Ashcroft and Mueller were aware of the abuses and allowed them to continue. Government lawyers say the officials never specified how the men should be treated so they can't be held liable. 
Nigella Lawson stopped from boarding plane to US June 17, 2009. British chef and food writer Nigella Lawson arrives for the British premiere of the film Bruno at Leicester Square in central London.ReutersCelebrity chef Nigella Lawson, who acknowledged last year that she had occasionally used cocaine, was denied permission to board a flight to the United States over the weekend, the U.S. Embassy said.The embassy did not disclose the reason for refusing Lawson entry into the United States.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTEmbassy spokeswoman Lynne Platt said Thursday that Lawson was stopped from traveling Sunday and had subsequently been invited to the embassy to apply for a visa. She said such applications were generally handled "routinely and expeditiously."Lawson tweeted Saturday that she was going on vacation, but she also has worked in the U.S., where she co-hosted TV cooking competition "The Taste."British citizens need visas to work in the U.S. but not for a vacation.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said privacy laws meant it was "not at liberty to discuss an individual's processing." It said U.S. authorities may refuse passengers admission for various reasons, including drug use and "moral turpitude."The agency said 366 people a day were refused entry to the U.S. in 2013, of almost 1 million daily travelers.Lawson, author of "How To Be A Domestic Goddess," has had a turbulent year in which her personal life was scrutinized in the media.In July she divorced art collector Charles Saatchi after he was photographed grabbing her throat outside a London restaurant.In December she testified at the fraud trial of two former aides, and told the court she had used cocaine a handful of times. She denied claims by the defendants that she was a regular drug user."I promise you ... regular cocaine users do not look like this," said Lawson, who is known for her voluptuous figure.Police later said they would not be investigating Lawson.Lawson's co-host on "The Taste," chef Anthony Bourdain, tweeted that he was "absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of U.S. actions" over Lawson's travel.Bourdain told The Associated Press in an email that Lawson was "the most focused, non-party, sober person I know. How this could happen — to her, of all people — is beyond me."A spokesman for Lawson declined comment.She is not the first British celebrity to fall afoul of U.S. immigration officials. In 2008 the late singer Any Winehouse, who had a marijuana arrest and well-publicized problems with alcohol and drugs, was refused a visa to perform at the Grammy Awards.Singer Lily Allen was denied a visa the same year, shortly after she was arrested over an altercation with photographers.+ FollowFOX411 on Facebook 
No love here: Why Jeb Bush is losing the conservative pundit primary  Also ... Photoshopping women (con't.)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTNo love here: Why Jeb Bush is losing the conservative pundit primary Jeb Bush has achieved his goal: he’s got the chattering classes yakking about him as a presidential candidate.Unfortunately for him, the chatter is mostly negative, especially on the right.And maybe that’s what the former Florida governor wanted to find out.Bush seems a reluctant candidate, at least compared to Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and many other Republican wannabes. So he was using the media spotlight the other day in Texas, including a Fox News interview, to essentially dare his party to accept him.Here, according to my handy-dandy pundit psychoanalyzing machine, is the subtext of his comments.So you think you want another Bush on the ticket? You’d be getting a guy who believes in compassion for illegal immigrants. I’m not going to play the self-deportation pandering game. Message: I care, as my dad used to say. You’re also getting a guy who believes in education reform, including Common Core, the program that Republicans love to hate. If I do this, I’m going to run a hopeful campaign, not a slash-and-burn operation. And if you don’t want me, fine. I don’t need this gig.If I’m right, this was a rather shrewd testing of the waters by a man who recognizes the steep obstacles to his candidacy. Who else plays up his disagreement with the GOP base on one of the most divisive issues around?Bush’s comments about not treating illegal immigrants as hard-core criminals because they’re coming here to feed their families did not exactly draw a standing ovation. The mainstream pundits may want him to run, but conservatives are another story entirely.“I mean, that statement he made about illegal immigrants being an act of love is kind of bizarre,” said Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer. “I grant him the complete sincerity and honesty of his view, he’s always had that kind of approach. But that’s leading with your chin.”Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor who worked in George H.W. Bush’s White House, said there’s “no way” we will see a Jeb-Hillary race.“He’s a good man; he hasn’t been involved in any of the fights of the Obama years,” Kristol said on “Morning Joe.” “Republicans are kind of worked up about ObamaCare, about the federal policy failures, that like someone who is either engaged in those fights in Washington or a governor who’s governed successfully in real time. i.e., now, so a Scott Walker or a Mike Pence, or a Ted Cruz or a Marco Rubio or a Paul Ryan.”Then he got to the dynasty question: “If it’s Bush against Clinton, it’s two people who have been around an awful long time, two people who sort of inherited the mantle. And then Hillary gets to say, ‘I’m the first woman president.’ And Jeb gets to say, ‘I’m the third Bush president.’ That’s not a good match-up for Republicans.”In fact, Rush Limbaugh trumps my theory with his own psychoanalysis, telling a caller:“I’ve got a guy who think Jeb is trying to disqualify himself, right now just because he doesn’t want to run and he doesn’t want all these people trying to draft him, so say something he knows is not going to be accepted and get it out of the way.”Then couldn't Jeb, you know, just not run?Karl Rove, the former George W. lieutenant, was more sympathetic toward the immigration comments. “This is a kerfluffle over an inartful way of saying something,” he said on Fox.Jonah Goldberg examines the so-called Bush brand:“For years conservatives have quietly spoken of how we elected ‘the wrong Bush’ in 2000. Jeb’s national reputation on the right was always better than George’s, at least outside of Texas. But Jeb lost his first bid for Florida governor and that ruined the timing for him. As a result, George W. was able to successfully trade on the value of the Bush brand first.“The trouble is, fairly or unfairly, that brand is tarnished. Among the rank and file of the GOP — particularly among Tea Party types — no one wants to see another Bush on the ballot. It’s not unimaginable that a Bush nomination would spark a significant third-party movement on the right.”And the moment has pop-culture resonance as well. Even Stephen Colbert got into the act, lecturing Bush for his heresy on immigration: “It is not an act of love, sir. It is an illicit, filthy act of border penetration.”What’s striking in the media coverage is that few are making the positive case for Bush: He’s seen as a grownup, had a solid record in Florida, can easily raise big bucks, and the GOP usually nominates the establishment candidate (McCain, Romney) over the insurgent.Instead, there’s a lot of focus on how he hasn’t run for anything since 2002 and doesn’t know how to compete in today’s hyper-fast media environment.Jeb Bush knows the ordeal of running for president, having seen it up close with his dad and his brother. No wonder he's not in a rush to make up his mind.Photoshopping women (con't.)I mentioned Tuesday that posters for the Breitbart website had turned Nancy Pelosi into a twerking, tongue-wagging Miley Cyrus, and Democrats are upset. “Disrespectful to all women … A disgusting new low.”But I haven’t seen much reaction from conservatives — with the notable exception of National Review’s Jim Geraghty:“I’m sure one justification will be, ‘Look, you have to do something shocking to get people’s attention!’ That’s true, but at some point the shocking image defines the institution and sets the expectation for the publication. What is it that the publication really wants to say? Ultimately, our objection to Pelosi, Jerry Brown, Zuckerberg, etc., is with their ideas, philosophies and policies, not how they look, right?...“The second justification for the Pelosi image will be, ‘The Left does it too!’ And indeed they do. But when do efforts to expose the Left’s double standard reach the point where the Right doesn’t have a standard?“At some point we’re going to have to decide what we want: a political culture in which Sarah Palin, or, say, S.E. Cupp etc. can be depicted in sexist, humiliating and derogatory ways, as well as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary and anyone else, or one in which that’s considered out of bounds. We can’t say it’s only wrong when they do it.“I know, I know, I’m a stodgy old-school traditionalist who doesn’t understand how to fight the Left with its own tools and expose their hypocrisy and double standards, and I’m a dry, boring inside-the-Beltway insider.”But you’re a guy who’s willing to criticize his own side — and it would be nice to see more of that across the political spectrum. Top Twitter TalkWhite House hypocrisy on equal pay?Click for more from Media Buzz.Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

No Stranger To Controversy, Texas Pizza Chain Takes Heat Over Spicy Name A Texas-based pizza chain that's no stranger to controversy claimed censorship over decisions by media outlets to cancel segments or mention of Pizza PatrÃ³n's latest pizza offering because of its marketing name.The pizza, which includes nearly 90 slices of jalapeÃ±o-encrusted pepperoni as well as fresh pepper slices, is called "Pizza La Chingona,â using a slang term that, even in Spanish, it won't be mentioned on air. The ad features personalities bragging that they are "chingÃ³nâ (the masculine form of the word) enough to try the company's spicy new pizza.The verb form of "chingÃ³n" translates into English as the F-bomb."It's probably something you wouldn't tell your grandma or your mother," said one customer.  But many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans use the word with great regularity, often with a sense of things being "super-cool" or "awesome." And apparently, that's what the company had in mind when it chose the name."It's very spicy, and it's very good," says said Pizza PatrÃ³n Regional Director Yesica Cardosa.Austin, Tex., Spanish-language radio station "La Z" will air the commercial, but you won't hear the pizza's name."It has to be bleeped, we're not going to air it unfiltered, for sure," said Chase Rupe, VP of programming and operations at Emmis Communications.Like English-speaking TV and radio stations, the radio station is governed by Federal Communications Commission rules."Really don't have bright lines as to what we can and can't say [in Spanish], so it becomes a local judgment call, and we can certainly get fined if we err on the wrong side of that judgment," said Rupe.Violating FCC guidelines can cost stations thousands of dollars. Pizza PatrÃ³n, whose client base is around 70 percent Latino and immigrant, said several radio stations across the country are doing the same with the ad, but the chain doesn't plan on changing the pizzaâs name.The company has remained mostly mum on the matter, but a link on its website takes you to a statement alleging that the company is being censored for âspeaking Mexican.â"The decision to ban the spots over the name La Ch!#gona doesn't make much sense to us," said Andrew Gamm, brand director for Pizza PatrÃ³n in the statement. "We are being selectively censored to protect the Mexican listeners from so-called potentially 'offensive' language. These same networks regularly feature songs and talk-show dialogue that is much more risquÃ© than anything we are doing."According to the Real Academia EspaÃ±ola, the official institution responsible for overseeing the Spanish language, âchingÃ³nâ is defined as a Mexican slang term that is, "said of a person who is competent in an activity or knowledgeable in a specific area." So it goes with the contemporary interpretation mostly used by Mexican and Mexican-American youngsters.Pizza PatrÃ³n is a Dallas-based company with 89 franchises, mainly in Texas. Its founder and current chairman is Antonio Swad, who is of Lebanese and Italian descent.In 2013, the company closed 20 locations that were underperforming in markets like El Paso, Las Vegas and San Diego. Despite the closings, the company registered record sales in 2013 of $39.4 million. (Twenty-five new franchises are expected to open this year â 20 of them in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.)The company has made a name for itself with a long history of marketing promotions that many people find outrageous.In 2007, the restaurant chain began accepting Mexican pesos at some of its locations, and alerted customers to the fact with an ad campaign that included the Mexican flag and the catchphrase âWelcome, countrymanâ in Spanish.The company received hundreds of e-mails and calls accusing them of abetting illegal immigration and being anti-American. There were even death threats, they said."We took a lot of heat," Gamm told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time. "Obviously, it really struck a nerve with a lot of people."Five years later, the company made waves again when, for three hours on a Tuesday evening in June, all its locations gave away free pies to any customer who asked for them in Spanish.All people had to say was, âPizza, por favor,â and the companyâs ads for the giveaway instructed people how to say it.Still, Peter Thomas, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, told USA Today:âIt seems to punish people who canât speak Spanish, and I resent that â¦ In public areas, people should be speaking English, and that includes pizza parlors.âRead more stories at okcfox.comFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Obama And Congress Give One More Push For Immigration Reform WASHINGTON (AP) –  His agenda tattered by last year's confrontations and missteps, President Barack Obama begins 2014 clinging to the hope of winning a lasting legislative achievement: an overhaul of immigration laws.It will require a deft and careful use of his powers, combining a public campaign in the face of protests over his administration's record number of deportations with quiet, behind-the-scenes outreach to Congress, something seen by lawmakers and immigration advocates as a major White House weakness.In recent weeks, both Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, have sent signals that raised expectations among overhaul supporters that 2014 could still yield the first comprehensive change in immigration laws in nearly three decades. If successful, it would fulfill an Obama promise many Latinos say is overdue.The Senate last year passed a bipartisan bill that was comprehensive in scope that addressed border security, provided enforcement measures and offered a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. House leaders, pressed by tea party conservatives, demanded a more limited and piecemeal approach.Indicating a possible opening, Obama has stopped insisting the House pass the Senate version. And two days after calling Boehner to wish him happy birthday in November, Obama made it clear he could accept the House's bill-by-bill approach, with one caveat: In the end, "we're going to have to do it all."Boehner, for his part, in December hired Rebecca Tallent, a former top aide to Sen. John McCain and most recently the director of a bipartisan think tank's immigration task force. Even opponents of a broad immigration overhaul saw Tallent's selection as a sign legislation had suddenly become more likely. Boehner also fed speculation he would ignore tea party pressure, bluntly brushing back their criticism of December's modest budget agreement."The question is what are the core things that Republicans can't move away from, what are the core things that Democrats can't walk away from," said Republican pollster David Winston, who regularly consults with the House leadership. "You may have preferences and then you may have core elements. That's part of the process of going back and forth."If successful, an immigration compromise could restore some luster to Obama's agenda, tarnished in 2013 by failures on gun legislation, bipartisan pushback on his efforts to take military action against Syria and the disastrous enrollment start for his health care law.Obama has repeatedly argued that final immigration legislation must contain a path toward citizenship for immigrants who are in the United States illegally. Opponents argue citizenship rewards lawbreakers, and many Republicans are loath to support any measure granting citizenship no matter how difficult and lengthy that path may be.But some advocates of reform are beginning to rally around an idea to grant immigrants legal status in the U.S. and leave the question of citizenship out of the legislation. In other words, they can work, but not vote."I don't think this is a good idea because citizenship is important, but I don't think it is a big deal breaker either," Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a leading congressional advocate for overhauling U.S. immigration law, said in a speech last month. "Right now we have to stop the deportations that are breaking up families. And if we do not get citizenship this year, we will be back next year and the year after that."While strong majorities of Hispanics continue to back a pathway to citizenship, a Pew Research Center poll last month found that being able to live and work in the U.S. legally without the threat of deportation was more important to Latinos by 55 percent to 35 percent."Is the sticking point going to be we have to have immediate voting privileges for those who came here illegally?," Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who voted against the Senate immigration bill, said Sunday on ABC. "If the Democrats are willing to come halfway, I think we can pass something, some meaningful reform that would help the 11 million who are here."That the immigration argument is now over legalization versus citizenship is remarkable enough. A 2005 Republican House immigration bill, instead of legalizing immigrants, would have made them felons if they were not authorized to be in the U.S."That's seismic shift in the debate," said Randy Johnson, senior vice president of the pro-overhaul U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Obama, whose support among Latinos has dropped from nearly 80 percent to 55 percent, has been under increasing pressure to use his executive powers to limit deportations. Obama's Homeland Security Department has deported 1.9 million people during the president's nearly five years in office, prompting protests ranging from a 22-day fast by activists in Washington to outbursts at Obama public events."As long as we have a failure to achieve immigration reform, combined with the record-breaking level of deportations, there will continue to be great dissatisfaction in the Latino community with the president," said Janet Murguia, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Latino advocacy group.A House Republican retreat later this month could help GOP leaders devise a strategy. Some Republicans and Democrats say Boehner could wait until after the filing deadlines for 2014 primary elections, thus protecting some incumbents from tea party or other conservative challenges. That would mean no meaningful votes until after April.The White House's own strategy has not impressed before. Immigration advocates and Democratic lawmakers say the White House last year mistakenly assumed that the bipartisan Senate bill would create enough momentum to bulldoze its way through the House."They completely misunderstood the impact that the Senate bill would have," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a key Democrat on immigration who sits on the House Judiciary Committee. "To think that that would magically transform the House of Representatives was never in the cards."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Obama, Cantor phone call on immigration highlights finger-pointing, deep divide FILE: July 15, 2013: Demonstrators march against amnesty for illegal immigrants at a rally in Washington, D.C.REUTERSPresident Obama and House Republicans appear nowhere close to reaching a near-term compromise on immigration reform, following a conversation Wednesday between the president and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.Obama, who supports the comprehensive reform legislation passed last summer with bipartisan support in the Democrat-controlled Senate, accused the House Republicans of repeatedly failing to act on such legislation and appearing to prefer “the status quo of a broken immigration system over meaningful reform,” according to a statement issued Wednesday by the White House before his conversation with Cantor.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe president argued the Senate plan was a “common sense” agreement that will grow the economy by $1.4 trillion and reduce the federal deficit while providing a “tough but fair” pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million illegal immigrants.House Speaker John Boehner and his leadership team have expressed a desire to pass immigration reform but appear uncertain about whether they can get the votes from rank-and-file members, including a conservative wing that considers granting citizenship to those who came illegally to the United States tantamount to amnesty.In January, Boehner released a broad plan that included a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. However, the apparent lack of support appears to have shelved the issue until at least after the November elections.“The majority of Americans are ahead of House Republicans on this crucial issue and there is broad support for reform,” Obama also said, according to the White House statement. “I urge House Republicans to listen to the will of the American people and bring immigration reform to the House floor for a vote.”Cantor released his own statement following Wednesday's conversation, in which he said the House will not consider the Senate bill.“The president called me hours after he issued a partisan statement which attacked me and my fellow House Republicans and which indicated no sincere desire to work together,” the Virginia Republican said. “After five years, President Obama still has not learned how to effectively work with Congress to get things done. You do not attack the very people you hope to engage in a serious dialogue.”Cantor also said he told Obama the same thing he told him the last time they spoke -- that House Republicans support neither amnesty efforts nor the Senate immigration bill. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics

Obama says Ukraine deal a 'glimmer of hope,' but won't 'count on' Russian cooperation  President Obama said Thursday that a newly struck diplomatic agreement on Ukraine offers the "prospect" to "de-escalate" the crisis, but warned that the U.S. is preparing "additional consequences" if the Russians don't hold up their end of the bargain. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTObama called the agreement a "glimmer of hope" and said he hopes to see "follow-through" from the Russians. But he said: "I don't think given past performance, we can count on that." Obama addressed the developments in Ukraine during his first solo press conference in months. He also discussed the status of the Affordable Care Act and immigration talks, speaking for just about a half hour after making a surprise appearance in the briefing room. Obama voiced some skepticism in describing talks in Geneva among representatives of the U.S., Ukraine, Russia and the European Union. Their agreement would freeze for now any additional sanctions by the West on Russia, while calling for illegally armed groups to be disarmed and pro-Russian separatists to turn over government buildings they have seized. He said the U.S. still must be prepared to respond to "efforts of interference by the Russians" in eastern and southern Ukraine. "The question now becomes, will in fact they use the influence that they've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they've proposed, stabilize their economy and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected?" he said. The president kicked off the press conference late Thursday afternoon by defending his health care law and touting recent ObamaCare sign-up figures. He said the total number of people who have signed up on the Affordable Care Act exchanges has risen to 8 million. That's up from the 7.1 million reported at the end of March -- some were given until mid-April to sign up, which could account for the boost. Obama also said 35 percent who signed up on the federal marketplaces were under 35 years old -- a key and sought-after demographic. "This thing is working," Obama said, urging Republicans to drop efforts to repeal the law. "The repeal debate is and should be over." The president took an aggressive tone in battling Republicans, repeating past claims that they are "fear-mongering." Following the disastrous rollout of the exchanges in October, when HealthCare.gov was virtually unusable, Democrats have been hoping that higher-than-expected results could help their candidates reclaim the political high ground ahead of the midterm elections. Seven months out from Election Day, Democrats are seeking to turn the page on the law's flawed debut -- a strategy underscored last week when Obama announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who became the face of the rollout failure, was stepping down. The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics

That's got to be a top priority," he said."(W)hen it comes to immigration reform, we have to remind ourselves that there are people behind the statistics, that there are lives that are being impacted," Obama said, referring to the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country."(P)utting things off for another year, another two years, another three years, it hurts people. It hurts our economy. It hurts families," the president added.The Senate approved last June a bipartisan bill that strengthens border security and includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented.The Republicans who control the House presented in late January their immigration-reform policy, which only contemplates a guarantee of citizenship for young people who were brought into the country as children and are now enrolled in college or are serving in the Armed Forces.

Obama interrupted: President goes unscripted on immigration in exchange with protester Nov. 25, 2013: President Obama gestures as he attempts to respond to a protestor who began to heckle him about anti-deportation policies, at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center in San Francisco, Calif.APIn a candid exchange with a protester demanding immigration reform, President Obama Monday departed from his text during a San Francisco speech to blame congressional Republicans for not voting to support the measure.Obama had arrived Monday in the city's largely immigrant Chinatown neighborhood expecting to deliver a solo performance in support of passing immigration reform, but was interrupted by a heckler demanding he enact the legislation through executive order.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“If I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would,” Obama told him.“I need your help,” the protester, identified as Ju Hong, shouted from behind the stage.“Families are separated for Thanksgiving... . I need your help... . Mister President please use executive order to halt deportation for all 11.5 (million) undocumented immigrants in this country right now. We agree we need to pass reform. But at same time, you have the power to stop deportation.”The president turned and told his security detail not to remove the protester and said: “Actually, I don't. And that's why we're here … The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done...“Right now it’s up to the Republicans,” said the president, who restated his support for passing a reform bill in pieces.Obama spoke to about 600 people inside the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Rec Center, trying to rally support for immigration reform since any possibility that Congress will pass such legislation seems to be put off until at least next year.The Democrat-controlled Senate passed a sweeping immigration bill with bipartisan support earlier this year. The plan would provide a path toward citizenship for some of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.Companion legislation has stalled in the Republican-controlled House with chamber leaders trying to take a step-by-step approach that would begin with tighter border security. “It’s Thanksgiving," he told the crowd, "and we can carve that bird into multiple pieces. People aren’t worried about the process, they’re worried about the results. …. But it’s going to take some courage.”Obama also said he believes House Speaker John Boehner when he says he wants to pass immigration reform. But the president also tried to instill a sense of urgency for such a plan, which he argued started with his predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush.“If we don’t take the time now, we are undercutting our own future,” said the president, also arguing that the United States by not reforming its immigration laws is letting talent college graduates leave to work for competing nations and that reform would cut federal deficits and grow the economy by at least a trillion dollars.“This isn’t just the right thing to do,” he said. “It’s the smart thing to do.”        Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Obama marks 50th anniversary of Civil Rights Act Reflecting on the unique power of the office he holds, President Obama on Thursday honored Lyndon B. Johnson as leader who seized the presidency's opportunity to shape the "currents of history" and fulfill America's founding promises of equality. Marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act that Johnson championed, Obama lauded his Democratic predecessor's ability to grasp like few others the power of government to bring about change. And as the nation's first black president, Obama cast himself as benefactor of Johnson's efforts. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"I have lived out the promise of LBJ's efforts," Obama said, speaking on the end of a three-day summit commemorating the landmark law that ended racial discrimination in public places. The anniversary of the civil rights law's passage has spurred a renaissance of sorts for Johnson's domestic agenda, which also included the creation of Medicare, Medicaid and the Voting Rights Act. Against the backdrop of Obama's own troubled relationship with Congress, there have also been fresh bouts of nostalgia for Johnson's mastery of congressional deal-making. "No one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than President Johnson," Obama said. "He was charming when he needed to be, ruthless when required." The president also offered rare personal insights into his views on the office he has held for more than five years, casting it as a humbling perch with powerful possibilities. "Those of us who've had the singular privilege to hold the office of the presidency know well that progress in this country can be hard and it can be slow, frustrating. And sometimes you're stymied," he said. "You're reminded daily that in this great democracy, you are but a relay swimmer in the currents of history, bound by decisions of those who came before, reliant on the efforts of those who will follow to fully vindicate your vision," Obama continued. "But the presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates, by working within the confines of the world as it is, but also by reimagining the world as it should be." For Obama, who was criticized by some African-Americans in his first term for doing too little to help minorities, the commemoration of the Civil Rights Act dovetails with a focus on inequality and economic opportunity that has become an early hallmark of his second term with modest success. Democrats have seized on the broader theme as their battle cry for the election year. Using Johnson's domestic successes as a model, Obama made the case that the government can still play a role in enacting social programs that can address inequalities. "If some of this sounds familiar, it's because today we remain locked in the same great debate about equality and opportunity and the role of government," Obama said, noting that 50 years ago, too, some dismissed LBJ's "Great Society" as a failed experiment that encroached on liberty. Amid the celebrations, Obama said he sometimes worries that decades after the civil rights struggles it becomes easy to forget the sacrifices and uncertainties that defined the era. "All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt, all that's rubbed away," Obama said. "And we look at ourselves and say, oh things are just too different now, we couldn't possibly do now what they did then, these giants. And yet they were men and women too. It wasn't easy then." Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrived in Austin Thursday morning. Ahead of the president's remarks, the Obamas toured the LBJ library's "Cornerstones of Civil Rights" exhibit, which includes the Civil Rights Act singed by Johnson, as well as a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln and one of Lincoln's trademark stovepipe hats. The Obamas also met privately with members of Johnson's family. The president was introduced at Thursday's event by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who withstood violence and arrest during the civil rights marches through Alabama in the mid-1960s. Lewis said Obama's election marked a moment when the nation believed it "may have finally realized the vision President Johnson had for all of us -- to live the idea of freedom and eliminate the injustice from our beloved country." The summit marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act kicked off Tuesday with remarks from former President Jimmy Carter, who lamented residual racial inequality and Americans' apathy about the problem. Former President Bill Clinton followed on Wednesday, riffing on immigration and voting rights while warning that a modern-day reluctance to work together threatened to "put us back in the dustbin of old history." Former President George W. Bush was set to close the event later Thursday.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Obama pledges "more humane" immigration enforcement President Barack Obama ordered a review of immigration enforcement at a time when his administration is being strongly criticized by the Hispanic community, which is about to surpass the 2 million mark in deportations.That was announced by the White House in a communique after Obama met Thursday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Ruben Hinojosa, CHC Immigration Task Force Chair Luis Gutierrez and Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Xavier Becerra.The president told the Congress members that "he has asked Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to do an inventory of the Department's current practices to see how it can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law", the statement said.Obama, the statement said, also "emphasized his deep concern about the pain too many families feel from the separation that comes from our broken immigration system."Thursday's White House meeting reached a moment when lawmakers put the finishing touches on a resolution urging him to use all legal measures to suspend, delay or cancel the deportation of immigrants, media outlets said.His deportation policy has earned Obama harsh criticism from the Hispanic community, whose support was key in his two presidential campaigns.The latest to raise her voice against the president was National Council of La Raza head Janet Murguia, who recently called him the "deporter in chief" for the record number of deportations during his presidency.One out of every four deportees is the parent of a U.S.-born child, according to figures compiled by La Raza.

President Obama Says He Won't Use Executive Orders To Halt Deportations President Barack Obama does not wish to use any executive order to halt the deportation of undocumented immigrants, considering it would damaged efforts to pass immigration reform, religious leaders said after a meeting at the White House.The president said "he would not be doing anything to change the law as it currently exists," Luis Cortes, head of Hispanic faith-based organization Esperanza, told reporters after the session.Obama, according to Cortes, believes that unilateral moves by the White House could damage the prospects for congressional approval of immigration reform.The Senate passed a bipartisan reform measure last June, but the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has yet to act."This morning, the President met with faith leaders in the Oval Office to discuss the importance of taking action to pass commonsense immigration reform," the White House said in a statement.Obama "emphasized that while his Administration can take steps to better enforce and administer immigration laws, nothing can replace the certainty of legislative reform and this permanent solution can only be achieved by Congress," the statement said.Last month, Obama ordered the Department of Homeland Security to revise the policy of deporting the undocumented, which had reached a record 2 million-plus during his presidency, without violating current law.The six religious leaders who visited the White House Tuesday refrained from insisting that Obama resort to executive orders and trusted that it is still possible to pass immigration reform before Congress takes its August recess.Besides Cortes, Tuesday's meeting included Dr. Noel Castellanos, CEO of Christian Community Development Association in Chicago; JoAnne Lyon, General Superintendent of The Wesleyan Church in Indianapolis; Dr. Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention; and Dieter Uchtdorf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Obama, top Dems now appear to be pushing for comprehensive immigration reform FILE: Dec. 20, 2013. President Obama in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, D.C.APPresident Obama and his top Democrats on Capitol Hill appear to have reset their sights on the Republican-controlled House passing comprehensive immigration reform, instead of a step-by-step process, as lawmakers leave Washington for the Christmas holiday break.The president on Friday appeared to urge the House to back the comprehensive, bipartisan immigration bill the Senate passed this summer -- a departure from recent comments that suggested Obama was OK with the lower chamber’s apparent piecemeal plan.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“The Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country,” Obama said in the year-end press conference. “So let’s go ahead and get that done.”Though Obama has pressed House Republicans hard in the final months of 2013 on immigration reform, his remarks this week appear in contrast to him saying in November that he had no problem with House leaders carving the immigration bill into, say, five pieces.“As long as all five pieces get done, I don't care what it looks like," he told The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council. "What we don't want to do is simply carve out one piece of it . . . but leave behind some of the tougher stuff that still needs to get done."Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner has repeatedly said he will neither scheduled a vote on the Senate bill, as Vice President Biden called for last week, nor negotiate with Senate Democratic on the upper chamber’s legislation.“We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,” The Ohio Republican said last month.Though the House has yet to vote on any part of an immigrations bill, the chamber appears to be concerned first with securing the U.S.-Mexico border and not including a path to citizenship for some of the estimate 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada, appeared to continue the shift among Democrats when he suggested this weekend that Boehner will negotiate next year on comprehensive reform.Boehner has indeed expressed a willingness to pass reform, despite some opposition from the chamber’s conservative wing. But he purportedly wants to wait until after the congressional primaries this spring and summer.“I think that John Boehner will conference with the Senate,” Reid told The Hill newspaper, suggesting that Boehner can triumph over the Tea Party like he did earlier this month in getting the votes to pass the House-Senate budget bill.  “I was very impressed with his saying, as far as I’m concerned, what was long overdue. The government shutdown, it was being driven by these people he criticized.”Reid also suggested that House members facing reelection in Democratic-leaning or middle-of-the road districts might need to vote for immigration reform.Still, any effort to push a bill perceived by conservatives as too light on border security and too lenient on legalization is sure to face stalwart opposition from some outspoken Republican Party members including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Reps. Steve King, of Iowa, and Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina.Even Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party-back lawmaker who co-sponsored, now appears to favor a more piecemeal approach.“The most realistic way to make progress on immigration would be through a series of individual bills,” a Rubio spokesman said this fall.   Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Obama tries for reset with Sebelius gone  **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**Buzz Cut:ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTOBAMA TRIES FOR RESET WITH SEBELIUS GONEJust 10 days after declaring she would “absolutely” be on the job in November, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is stepping down. The official Democratic spin is that having safely landed what the NYT calls the “disastrous” launch of key components of ObamaCare, Sebelius deserves the thanks of a grateful nation. She may have mangled the start, they say, but the former Kansas governor got it together in time and saved the day. Whew! In fact, some influential figures on the left complained that Sebelius’ departure came too soon, interrupting what many Democrats believe to be positive developments for the troubled law. MSNBC’s top political personality, Rachel Maddow, said it was like a sports team that “stops halfway through their victory lap to fire the coach.” It would seem, then, that the administration has been too successful at selling its version of events.[“The majority of people calling for me to resign I would say are people who I don’t work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place.” – Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaking to reporters in October.]Who knew? - Sebelius, being a seasoned pro, no doubt tendered her resignation months ago when the comically bad launch of ObamaCare’s online home outraged liberals who then, as now, believed that the law was about to turn a corner with popular opinion. Her agency and the contractors it hired were terrible at the Internet, which was especially embarrassing for a party and an administration that take pride in tech savvy. President Obama reportedly considered pulling the plug on the site in the weeks after the initial crash. If he would have done so, he almost certainly would have been obliged to send Sebelius packing then, and many Democrats would have applauded his move as a decisive turn toward accountability. But they went a different way. The president and his team instead opted to stumble forward, pad enrollment numbers, delay unpopular or particularly damaging provisions and slog on to April when the White House could declare the mission accomplished. Obama broadly hinted that he was not happy with her work, and did not have her present when he declared the launch successful because the government claimed it had met a goal it set for itself (but subsequently denied having set). But how did Sebelius think that she had Rumsfeldian levels of job security last week but this week find herself having a cabinet secretary’s version of a conscious uncoupling ceremony with Valerie Jarret at a tony West End restaurant?       [Watch Fox: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appears in the 1 p.m. ET hour]Reading her own press releases? - The most likely cause for Sebelius’ quick flight from confidence to cashiering is that Obama wanted a clean excision. Having already prepped Clintonite management whiz Sylvia Burwell to take the gig with a turn as his budget boss, the president was ready for a quick strike. But that doesn’t explain why Sebelius ever thought she would stay so long when it was obvious to even the most unsophisticated observer that the end of the enrollment period was the right moment to toss her overboard.  It may be that she made a cardinal mistake in Washington: believing her own spin. If Sebelius really believes that the biggest problem with the law was the Web site and that Americans are about to start digging on some delicious ObamaCare now that it works better she should be listening to Obama insiders who make it clear that the corner is still way out in the future. Like, way out.[Washington Examiner: “Burwell, 48, a Harvard-educated West Virginia native and Rhodes scholar, was confirmed as Obama’s budget director on a 96-0 Senate vote nearly a year ago. Low-key and unassuming, the former Clinton administration official is known as a straight-shooter and an effective manager of the White House’s budget arm, which is enmeshed in carrying out the health care policy.”]Good time to go - The most painful parts of the implementation of the law still lay ahead. And if anything, Sebelius should be very glad to be excused at the moment where at least some people believe the law to be on the rebound after four brutal years. She will be gone for rate shocks, policy dumping, narrowed networks, non-existent policies, multiple downward revisions of enrollment numbers and the economic consequences as employers get ready for the boom to lower. The view of all that will look a lot better from K Street than it will from her bunker at HHS.  Sniff, sniff - White House communications honcho Dan Pfeiffer took umbrage at Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for issuing this tweet: “Are you going to be drinking out of a red solo cup or crystal stemware tonight as you celebrate @Sebelius resigning?” Pfeiffer tweeted in response: “All class in the GOP.” It’s a good thing that Pfeiffer would never be mean spirited on Twitter or be flippant about a sensitive subject or make an enormous mistake on social media.  Fox News Sunday preview - Host Chris Wallace welcomes Reps.

And the economy and jobs always lead the way when you ask American voters what is most important to them. But Harvard University’s Institute of Politics has a new study that may make Democrats shudder about another, often overlooked, issue: the national debt. The study says that to eliminate the national debt, every American would have to cough up $176,000. The study says debt has surged 57 percent under President Obama and the use of food stamps has surged 77 percent. Here’s where the shudder part comes in – the study reveals that the federal debt is a major concern to a lot of Americans, including a lot of younger Americans.

Jeb Bush, R-Fla., offered no retreat from his position that angered many conservatives earlier this week. During a Monday event Bush said many illegal immigrants are in the U.S. as an “act of love.” At Thursday’s event, the former Florida governor said he was surprised his comments have caused so much controversy. “I’ve been saying this for the last three or four years,” Bush told the gathering. “The simple fact is there is no conflict between enforcing our laws, believing in the rule of law and having some sensitivity to the immigrant experience, which is a part of who we are as a country.” Bush furthered, “It makes no sense, it is not an American value to want people to stay in the shadows.”Battle for the border - NYT provides a glimpse as to why illegal immigrant border crossings are on the rise: “After six years of steep declines across the Southwest, illegal crossings have soared in South Texas while remaining low elsewhere. The Border Patrol made more than 90,700 apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley in the past six months, a 69 percent increase over last year. The new migrant flow, largely from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, is straining resources and confounding Obama administration security strategies that work effectively in other regions.”DUCK!

Obama urges House Republicans to vote for immigration reform President Barack Obama marked Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the introduction of the bipartisan immigration reform approved last June by the Senate by calling on Republicans in the House of Representatives "to listen to the will of the American people" and bring the measure to a vote."The Senate's commonsense agreement would grow the economy by $1.4 trillion and shrink the deficit by nearly $850 billion over the next two decades, while providing a tough but fair pathway to earned citizenship to bring 11 million undocumented individuals out of the shadows," the president said in a statement."Simply put, it would boost our economy, strengthen our security, and live up to our most closely-held values as a society," Obama said of the Senate legislation.While House Republicans, who refuse to allow the bill to be voted upon "have repeatedly failed to take action, seemingly preferring the status quo of a broken immigration system over meaningful reform," the president said."Instead of advancing commonsense reform and working to fix our immigration system, House Republicans have voted in favor of extreme measures like a punitive amendment to strip protections from 'Dreamers,'" Obama said, referring to GOP attempts to undo his administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.He went on to cite "broad support for reform, including among Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and faith and law enforcement leaders."

Official: Republic of Congo deports nearly 60,000 people to neighboring Congo in 3 weeks KINSHASA, Congo –  Officials say nearly 60,000 Congolese citizens now have been deported from its much smaller neighbor Republic of Congo in the last three weeks.Many of those being ordered to leave have complained of mistreatment on the part of the forces carrying out the deportations.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTCongo's interior minister, Richard Muyej Mangez, said Friday at a news conference in Kinshasa that authorities there now were opening investigations into the allegations made by the deportees.He said Congo had no plans to pursue reciprocal actions against citizens from Republic of Congo however.Authorities in Republic of Congo maintain that the deportees lack the proper immigration papers to stay in Brazzaville.And the mayor of its capital has said that any police officers caught abusing citizens would face justice. 
Officials find more than 100 people in Houston house in suspected human smuggling operation  HOUSTON –  A house overflowing with more than 100 people presumed to be in the U.S. illegally was uncovered just outside Houston on Wednesday, a police spokesman said.The suspected stash house was found during a search for a 24-year-old woman and her two children, a 7-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, that were reported missing by relatives late Tuesday after a man failed to meet them as planned at an undisclosed location on the city's north side, said John Cannon, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department. Many of the people in home that authorities said appeared to be part of a human smuggling operation were dressed only in undergarments and they were sitting in in filthy conditions and surrounded by trash bags full of old clothing, Cannon said.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTWhen police opened the door to the home they found "a large, large group of people, some sitting on top of one another, very confined spaces," Cannon said. "They yell out the woman's name to see if she is in there, and she emerges with the two children. They're OK."The single-family home, in southern Harris County, is about 1,500-square-feet, Cannon said. At first, officers saw only a mattress on the floor and a refrigerator in an exterior room. It was when they went further into the house that they found the people — 94 men, all in their undergarments and shoeless, 15 women and the woman with her two children — lying in filth in several small rooms, all with access to one bathroom and no hot water.Many of the women said they had been in the house for three or four days, Cannon said. One woman said she had been there for 15 days. All of them said they were hungry, thirsty and tired."It was just filth, very squalid-like conditions inside. Trash bags with clothing piled as high as you can see," Cannon said. "They were very surprised at the numbers of people inside. Some were just sitting on top of one another because there was just no room."Authorities said five men have been arrested.Houston police have handed the investigation over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE spokesman Greg Palmore said it has been five years since officials uncovered a house in the Houston area with this many people inside. In 2012, a house with 86 people was discovered, he said.ICE took the people in the home into custody and they will be questioned and fed, Palmore said. The people were primarily from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, he said. Two of the people, a pregnant woman and a man, have been taken to a hospital for unknown treatment, he added. Although Palmore said it was too early to say whether this was part of a human trafficking operation, he said it appeared that way.Houston sits about seven hours from the Mexican border, making it a popular route for immigrants, Palmore explained."Houston is significant for the highway corridors that make up Houston, I-45 and I-10. With those two traffic corridors you can pan out anywhere in the United States," Palmore said. "And it's very easy to assimilate into the communities here."The home was found after Houston police were tipped off that the woman and children they were looking for may have been taken there. Cannon said police set up surveillance points outside the house early Wednesday and pulled over a car with two men inside for a routine traffic stop when they saw them leaving the driveway. Handguns and documents that suggested illegal activity were found in the car, leading police to detain the two men and enter the house, he said.After the people were removed and a count began, three men attempted to flee on foot, Cannon said. Those men have also been detained and are suspected of illegal activity as well. In addition, police found two coops with hundreds of chickens on the property that are part of an investigation into illegal cock-fighting, he said.Police have not identified the suspects. 
Off to the Races: Budget battles all about 2014 midterms April 1, 2014: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House.APIf the upcoming spring recess on Capitol Hill is the unofficial kick-off to the midterm races, congressional lawmakers sure are warming up. Lately, they've been bickering -- a lot -- over dueling budget plans, with the latest version pioneered by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., dominating the dialogue. That plan was approved in the House on Thursday. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTMany Republicans here are praising its cuts to government spending, with many Democrats demagoguing them. Here's why: The Ryan plan, proponents say, will start to tackle America's crushing debt by slashing more than $5 trillion in projected spending and balancing the budget in the next 10 years. It achieves this by, among other things, reforming entitlement spending, repealing ObamaCare and scaling back on social programs like food stamps -- where spending has grown exponentially in recent years. "We believe that this is our obligation to our fellow citizens to get out government to live within its means," Ryan said. "A country that lives beyond its means today is a country that will necessarily have to live below its means tomorrow and we do not want to do that to our children and our grandchildren. Getting government to live within its means, balancing the budget, paying off the debt is good for economic growth." In a debate that falls against the looming 2014 midterms, Democrats have a drastically different take. They say the Ryan budget protects the wealthiest of Americans, while its cuts to education and social programs target children and seniors. "I view the Ryan budget as an ideological manifesto," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said. "It's a tragedy for the country." The top Democrat on the House Budget Committee Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., added that the plan, "at every turn, chooses to protect special interests tax breaks for powerful special interests, at the expense of everybody else in the country." And House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called it a "blueprint for economic decline, for vulnerable Americans being left to fend for themselves," and for, "an America less equipped to protect its citizens." Budgets everywhere To counter their colleagues across the aisle, the Democrats are offering an alternative. It includes tax hikes of close to $2 trillion and spending increases of more than $700 billion, opponents say. ObamaCare remains intact, unemployment insurance is extended, and comprehensive immigration reform is even included. The House's congressional black and progressive caucuses also rolled out their own budget plans. Even South Carolina Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney got in on the action, offering what he characterized as President Obama's budget, just to show how little support there was for it in the House. It got two votes after Van Hollen sent out a letter to his colleagues calling it a "political stunt." Arguably, there is no need to do a budget this year. Discretionary spending levels were already set at $1.014 trillion after Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Wash., struck a deal which passed both chambers.  It will be a series of appropriations bills, which will pass within that spending level, that ultimately become law. All of these currently debated budget resolutions are non-binding. So what's the point? Republicans and Democrats alike will say budgets reflect priorities and show the American people what lawmakers care about, and what they don't. They are also filled with what some operatives call Easter eggs, or treasures which appeal to a party base. Off to the races Further, budgets are a handy money-raising tool. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has actually been fundraising off the Ryan budget ever since House Speaker John Boehner said it would be crafted back in February. In fact, that month was one of the strongest the DCCC ever had with its grassroots donors. Their effort kicked into high gear this week with a blast of additional fundraising emails. "This budget motivates our grassroots supporters, who are so furious about Washington Republicans stacking the deck for special interests," DCCC National Press Secretary Josh Schwerin told Fox News. DCCC Chairman Rep Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who said the Ryan budget "should have just printed a middle finger to the middle class on page one," also called the plan a defining issue in the midterms. Asked this week if all this was enough for the Democrats to take control of the House back, Pelosi put the brakes on. "We're not thinking politically on this," she said. "We just want to have a debate on the issues because this is about who we are as a country." Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

On Jebâs 'Act Of Love': Republicans Should Keep Looking For A Presidential Candidate Call it the Jeb Bush, establishment-Republican variation on âthey are just looking for a better lifeâ clichÃ©. And letâs just call him âJeb.âIn what should be the last words of a viable presidential campaign probe, Jeb defends the victims of borders who illegally enter the remnants of the Republic and take American jobs with the unforgettable words "yes, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love, it's an act of commitment to your family.â- D.A. KingIs Jeb saying that anyone in the world with a commitment to their family should be allowed to live and work in the U.S. as long as they don't plan on felonious activity?  If so, it could get very crowded. We already take in more than a million legal job-seekers every year.Not many Americans should have much trouble closing their eyes and imagining Jebâs mindless, pandering proclamations coming out of the mouth of any screaming SEIU street protestor carrying a ânot one more deportationâ placard.If not a careful explanation of why Marco Rubio took a painful â and likely permanent â nosedive in the presidential polls, somebody may want to forward the current unemployment numbers to the Bush compound. And maybe send along the United States Code regarding identity fraud and theft of Social Security numbers. Or the fact that coming back to the USA after deportation is a felony.Jeb floated his âso be itâ ramblings while at least 20 million Americans who are committed to their families are out of work or underemployed. The day after Jebâs remarks, the Democrat-controlled Senate passed a bill to again extend unemployment payments for Americans who have been out of work for at least six months.Apparently American families â of all descriptions â are not a priority for Jeb when it comes to the politics of dutifully providing the business bosses with âcheapâ labor.Call it an exploratory expedition. In publicly supporting the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty/immigration expansion scam that will never see the presidentâs desk and putting forth his Chuck Schumer-esqe âitâs an act of loveâ notion, Jeb set out to gauge the progress of the tireless propaganda work of the amnesty-again coalition. Somebody had to venture out to see if Big Business, Big Religion, âBig Razaâ, many in Big Media, the Democrats and the Republican establishment bosses have convinced the GOPâs conservative base that it is time for another amnesty. âDo you believe us yet?â they wonder, âthis time, we are really going to secure the borders. But later. Trust us.âIt was big of Jeb to allude to âthe rule of lawâ in his remarks. And to the possibility that the 40 percent or so of the illegal aliens present in the U.S. who are visa overstayers may be âpolitelyâ asked to leave. What next, a Jeb suggestion that the âsecure the homelandâ laws put in place after 9/11 requiring biometric monitoring of temporary visa holderâs departures actually be funded and politely enforced?Many Americans who love their families suspect that if there were any real intent to secure American borders and enforce our immigration laws, it would have begun on September 12, 2001.Using information recently released by DHS, Jessica Vaughan at the Center for Immigration Studies notes âICE released 68,000 criminal aliens in 2013, or 35 percent of the criminal aliens encountered by officers. The vast majority of these releases occurred because of the Obama administrationâs prosecutorial discretion policies.ââThe preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed. Even those with criminal convictions are being released. DHS is a department in crisisâ says Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama.One can only imagine a Jeb-run immigration enforcement apparatus.Somebody tell Jeb: According to news reports, in an annual report released this month, "One Nation Underemployed: Jobs Rebuild America," the National Urban League noted that the underemployment rate for African-American workers was 20.5 percent, 18.4 percent for Hispanic workers and 11.8 percent for white workers."Many Americans are being left behind, and that includes African-Americans and Latinos who are being disproportionately left behind by the job creation that we see," National Urban League President Marc Morial said. We wonât hear it from the âparty-of-the-working manâ Democrats, but another amnesty and doubling immigration is not the solution to this shameful crisis.Neither is Jeb.Republicans with a commitment to inclusion and victory should keep looking for a presidential candidate. As an act of love.D.A. King is president of the Georgia-based Dustin Inman Society, which works to control immigration . He is not a member of any political party.

Opinion: Breaking Down The Numbers Of The Immigration System Breaking Our Economy After the 2012 presidential election â the one where Mitt Romneyâs call for âself-deportationâ drove Latino voters away from the GOP by an historic margin â Republican leaders were falling all over themselves to embrace immigration reform. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), promised immigration reform would be a âpriorityâ in 2013 and said he was confident Democrats and Republicans would âfind the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all." We all know how that worked out.Instead of following the lead of the U.S. Senate, which passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package nearly a year ago, the House has offered the nation little more than feeble excuses for its refusal to act. First, it was the Tea Party-manufactured fiscal crisis which consumed most of September and closed the government for the first two weeks of October. Then, after the government reopened, the House GOP leadership claimed there were not enough days left in the 2013 legislative calendar to schedule a vote on immigration reform (never mind that they control the legislative calendar). Then, in January 2014, shortly after they revealed their âPrinciples on Immigration Reformâ Speaker Boehner, unveiled what is perhaps the lamest excuse of all. The House GOP, so he claimed, could not move immigration reform because âthereâs widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws.â - David LeopoldIn order to prop up their partisan political games, House GOP is blatantly ignoring whatâs happening in communities all across the country. Despite the hot air emanating from Capitol Hill, there is stone-cold immigration enforcement being meted out by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to the tune of 1,100 deportations per day. That translates to nearly 400,000 people per year, often at the expense of core American principles such as fairness, equal treatment, and due process. Letâs look at the numbers:â¢ In the first five years of the Obama administration, 2 million people were deported from the U.S. at a time when illegal immigration is at a 40-year-low.â¢ Federal prosecutions of immigration-related offenses are up an astounding 468 percent from 2003, which leads to the administrationâs claim it is focusing on criminal rather than ordinary immigrants.â¢ 430,000 non-citizens a year are locked up in immigration detention facilities at an annual cost to taxpayers of $2 billion.â¢ Since 2006 Congress has funded a near-doubling of Border Patrol agents.â¢ Deportations without due process â without any opportunity to see an immigration judge â have risen dramatically and now account for 70 percent of annual deportations.And while the Republicans may live in a world of immigration enforcement denial, whatâs happening on the ground has not been lost on immigration advocates, some of whom have labeled the President the âDeporter-in-Chiefâ and called on him to stop unnecessary deportations, especially of undocumented immigrants with U.S. citizen spouses or children.  The truth is that the heavy-handed enforcement policy dates back nearly a decade to the Bush administration. There are two key statistics in the DHS deportation numbers that illustrate how enforcement has been changed â 1) Voluntary returns, or those caught by U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities when they cross the border but returned to their country without a formal deportation order; and 2) Removals, those who are sent back with a formal order of deportation issued by an immigration judge or immigration officer. The number of voluntary returns has dropped dramatically since the recession because fewer people are attempting to enter illegally. Additionally, since 2005, DHS has shifted away from voluntary returns, preferring instead to issue formal removal orders which carry more severe legal consequences. Itâs patently absurd to claim the administration is not enforcing the law. Whatâs clear is that deportations of undocumented immigrants â many of whom have come to America to feed their families â have steadily increased since 2002. Whatâs also clear is that while the House GOP blocks reform, the broken immigration system is wreaking havoc on the nation, threatening Americaâs global competitiveness and compromising our core American values of fairness, due process and the rule of law. The time is now for action on two fronts: the GOP leadership must stop making excuses and move concrete immigration reform legislation to the House floor for a vote, and President Obama must curb the zealous deportation of those who would qualify for reform.David Leopold is the former national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and currently practices immigration law in Cleveland, Ohio.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino   
Opinion: Is The Hard-Right Anti-Immigration Reform Front Cracking Before Our Eyes? Kentucky Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul voted against the Senateâs bipartisan Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill last year. While there might not be âhordesâ of illegally present people in his state, itâs fair to say that most of the labor infrastructure in Kentucky of the horse racing industry is peopled with many people who are here illegally. Senator Rand knows who works in his state and who doesnât and, more importantly, who hires them.People should pay attention to their representatives; Senator Rand thinks that the Republican Party should not be characterized as the Party of âDeportation.âIs the hard-right anti-immigration reform front cracking in front of our eyes?- Raoul Lowery ContrerasFirst, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush made an idyllic statement about the men and women who brave death and destruction to walk hundreds of miles through deserts and mountains to cross into the US without formal inspection by U.S. officers as people who do so as an âact of love.â Love, of course of their families and themselves because they reject poverty, corruption and inattention by their own people.Secondly, in the aftermath, Bushâs statement caused explosions of anger among the 25 percent or so who absolutely reject legalizing the illegally present people and allowing them to stay or come legally which is not possible under current law. The hard right went berserk over that statement. Even the lovely and smart Laura Ingraham blew a fuse when Foxâs Bill OâReilly asked her if she could support Jeb Bush for President in 2016 after that one statement.Thirdly, those who object to Bushâs statement and emotionally decry it by declaring that Bush is cooked because THEY wonât support him for President are now reacting in the same manner to Randâs statement as they did to Bush and did last year to Marco Rubioâs sponsorship of the Senate immigration bill. Yes, the same one-issue obstructionists are turning on Senator Rand because he said that the Republican Party should not be the party of âDeportation.âThese minority obstructionists need to study American history for they stand against it in the specifics of their obstructionism and their inability to live up to the best of American history.When Southerners blackmailed the North in the Constitutionâs development on the subject of slavery, the North at least made it illegal to import slaves after 1820. When the South stood in the way of state expansion, the Missouri Compromise was reached allowing limited slavery expansion as against unlimited. When California entered the nation as a free state it did so as a result of a compromise. When Abraham Lincoln needed thousands of German speaking immigrants to join the Union Army to fight for the Union he appointed German speaking generals that he personally didnât like or know because he needed the troops. Journalists spotted the Germans throughout the Union Army when the soldiers would reply to their questions with something like: âI fite vit Schmidt.âIn 1876, Republicans made a deal with Democrats to withdraw the ten-year-long occupation of the South by the U.S. Army if the Democrats recognized the Presidential election returns that kept the Republicans in the White House despite their winning fewer votes than the Democrats.Deals, compromise, bipartisanship are the three legs of American governance in our two-party system. First, of course, the basic reason we in the USA have a superior form of government and governance than anywhere in the world is that we have a two party system with winner take all. We do not have multi-parties and/or proportional representation and we do not have a parliamentary system. Lastly, we have a real constitution that divides the government into three equal parts, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.The political parties are keys to how our governance works. For example, how would independent Ross Perot have put together an administration had he won in 1992? There are literally thousands of jobs and functions and representations on boards and commissions that the President and the White House must appoint. The parties provide a clearing house for these appointive jobs and functions. Todayâs city councilman or county commissioner is tomorrowâs congressman or senator or even president. Patronage, it is called and it is a universal system but if a political party is not involved in most of the US, it is hard to govern. A certain Minnesota independent ex-governor discovered this the hard way. Ross Perot would have found it impossible to be President without one or the other of our parties making a deal with him.Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Kelly Ayotte, John McCain and others in the Senate are now joined by former Florida governor Jeb Bush in pushing the party toward compromise on immigration; compromise in the best American tradition wins elections. Those unwilling to compromise or are one-issue fanatics stand to lose in the long run of American history, the long run being 2016.Raoul Lowery Contreras is a political consultant. He was formerly with the New American News Service of the New York Times Syndicate.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Opinion: Of Love And Politics, And Jeb Bush's Surprising Statement It was the immigrant and Latino vote that helped President Obama win the White House in 2008 and 2012 because of his promise to pass comprehensive immigration reform. After five years of relentless deportations under his administration, our President is destroying the immigrant communities who brought him to office.- Kica MatosCandidate and later President Obama captured the love of our communities because he spoke to us from a similar place as an aspiring former outsider in America. Yet that love has not been returned to our communities – instead, his administration is close to having deported two million people.So I was surprised to hear words of love recently from Jeb Bush, a potential GOP presidential candidate who said that yes, people break the law entering the United States illegally, but he added “it’s not a felony. It’s an act of love. It’s an act of commitment to your family.”On this, Jeb Bush and I agree. But love and politics apparently do not mix.As we’ve seen, the Obama administration has made many promises that have, as of yet, gone unfulfilled. President Obama has lamented the pain inflicted on immigrant communities, saying that “when nursing mothers are torn from their babies, when children come home from school to find their parents missing, when people are detained without access to legal counsel, when all that’s happening, the system just isn’t working.”This is why President Obama told the American public he would use more discretion when it came to deportations; he vowed to only target criminals and those who wish to do harm to our communities.Let’s look at the facts. Under his presidency, of the 2 million people that have been deported, The New York Times reported that just 20 percent of those cases involve people convicted of serious crimes, including drug convictions.That means that 1.6 million people – fathers, mothers, caregivers, family bread-winners, sons and daughters – have been ripped away from their families for minor infractions like running a red light or re-entering the U.S. in a desperate effort to be reunited with their families.People like Karina Magdaleno, a single mother who has been living and working in the U.S. for the past 15 years. Karina was hosting a party for her son’s first birthday when immigration officials showed up at her door and took her from her home and three children. Her crime? A simple traffic violation.And then there’s Marco Gonzalez, father of five American-born children who lived in the United States for 20 years after fleeing Guatemala, where he had been abducted by rebel forces and held captive for months. Marco was deported from the U.S. on December 30th of last year, leaving behind his wife and five kids, ranging in age from four to 14. Marco’s crime? A bad check from 15 years ago.Currently, re-entry into the United States after deportation is considered a felony, which is why Rosa Manriquez, a 62-year-old grandmother who had lived her entire adult life in the U.S., was forced to serve four months in a federal prison. “Never, never in her life had she been in one of these places, the Christian lady in federal prison,” her daughter said. “Every time I went to see her, all of us would cry. She would start crying so bad, she’d start shaking.”It’s almost laughable that House Republicans claim President Obama’s lack of immigration enforcement as the cause for their inaction on immigration reform. In the five years that Mr. Obama has been in office, the number of deportations involving undocumented immigrants whose most serious offense was a traffic violation have more than quadrupled compared to the last five years of President George W. Bush’s administration.We need to close this sad chapter in our country’s history and stop deporting people who have come here not to do harm, but to reunite with loved ones, support their families and find better lives.And we need a President and a Congress with the courage to stand up for these families. In 2012, we all saw what the immigrant and Latino vote could do. It’s time for our president to fulfill his promises, and for House Republicans to face the truth that they have two choices: stop destroying families, or prepare for the destruction of their party. The House GOP would do well to learn from Jeb Bush's ability to speak with moral power about the real lives of people being destroyed by their choice to block immigration reform for families.Kica Matos is spokesperson for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM).

Opinion: Roadblocks And All, We Will Win Immigration Reform I am not an immigrant. I was born and raised in the small Midwestern town where I still live today. And though the undocumented experience is not my own, I grew up seeing first-hand the toll it takes on the human spirit to be separated from your family. Our house was a place where undocumented relatives would stay after they migrated to the United States for the first time. I watched members of my family live in fear, and I witnessed others treat them as second-class citizens.- Rudy LopezAnd because of our broken immigration system, I have experienced the tremendous grief of losing a loved one. In 2005, my cousin Martin died as he was attempting to cross the border in search of a better life. Martin became sick along the journey, and the Coyote, or human smuggler who was supposed to act as his guide, abandoned him. Martin died in the desert, cold, hungry and alone. I saw how this immense sorrow nearly broke my family.In the past few years, I have witnessed the roller coaster of the legislative process. Just as we start to gain real momentum and get closer than ever to a win, we seem to lose some of that momentum. And as a result, Iâve watched countless families grow hopeful that immigration reform will actually pass, only to have that hope crushed.It is discouraging. For all of us. But then I have to remember the other things Iâve seen.During the fast and the six-week bus tour, Iâve met so many people who share a common purpose and share so many values. These people firmly believe that migration makes this country better, and that embracing immigration reform means embracing our countryâs heritage.The people that Iâve met along the way fight with everything they have. They bring unbelievable enthusiasm and energy to the movement. Along with the incredible amount of grief in the stories of innocent lives caught up in our broken system, Iâve encountered an equal amount of compassion, hope and commitment to continue fighting until we win.But of all the inspiring people I met along the way, perhaps the most powerful experience I had took place during my 22-day fast. It was just days before Christmas, and a group of young activists came to the Fast for Families tent to meet the fasters and tell their stories. Each of the children talked about what they wanted for Christmas and each child said the same thingâthey just wanted their parents back.These kids, some as young as five years old, were orphans with parents. Their lives had been thrown upside-down when their mothers and fathers were taken from them by immigration enforcement officials. In their faces I could see palpable pain and confusion and grief. But at the same time, in spite of all of that, I could clearly see that they had hope that they were going to find a solution.These kids set an example for me. When I start to get discouraged, as so many of us do, I have to remember that itâs always darkest before the dawn. Thereâs going to be struggle. Itâs going to be difficult getting there, but weâve never come this far before. Weâve never had so much support across the board from all different sectors across this country â everyone is with us. Weâre not going to allow a small group of people in one section of the government to stop whatâs right for our families and our country.My favorite poet, Pablo Neruda, once wrote, âThey can cut all the flowers, but they canât stop the spring from coming.â To me, that is confirmation of what is to come â a select group of lawmakers can put up all of the roadblocks they want, but they cannot stop the inevitable. We will win immigration reform.Rudy Lopez is Senior Organizer at the Fair Immigration Reform Movement and participated in Fast for Families: A Call for Immigration Reform & Citizenship.  Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Opinion: Russian Missiles Positioned In Caracas Are Ominous Sign Repression Will Worsen Three U.S. diplomats, the Panamanian mission, and even CNN Español, have recently been expelled from Venezuela under the pretext of “foreign intervention” in the Bolivarian Republic. Straight from the playbook of the late Hugo Chávez, his heir apparent Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has repeatedly accused the United States of intervening in domestic affairs and recently sent his Foreign Minister, Elías Jaua, on a public tour to “denounce” the U.S. and accuse the Secretary of State, John Kerry, of “…encourage[ing] the protests in Venezuela” and went as far as to call him a “murderer.”- Joseph HumireIn reality, it is Maduro who has invited foreign intervention into Venezuela on behalf of the Bolivarian government circumventing its sovereignty to Cuba, and calling on Iran, Russia, and China to aid and assist its violent suppression and intimidation of the Venezuelan people.  Shortly after the student mobilizations began on February 12th, a surge of armed pro-government civilian militias took to the streets of Venezuela, terrorizing the public by beating protestors, torturing political prisoners, and shooting some of the students. These militias, including civilian snipers and motorcycle gangs, all part of the so-called “colectivos,” are earning a reputation as one of the most violent, repressive civilian militias since the Iranian Basij organized a similar crack down on protestors during the Green Revolution of 2009.The similarity, however, is more than speculation.  In April of 2009, the current Iranian commander of the Basij paramilitary force, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Naqdi accompanied then Iranian Defense Minister General Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar on a high-level visit to Caracas upon invitation by the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and his then foreign minister Maduro.According to sources within the Venezuelan military, General Naqdi’s role in these high level meetings was to serve as an advisor to Venezuela’s Ministries of Defense and Interior to aid in training their civilian militias, i.e. the infamous colectivos.This advisory support is now playing out on the streets of several cities in Venezuela, as the colectivos have enhanced their capabilities to be able to serve as Maduro’s quick reaction force against protestors and opposition forces. Maduro’s Minister of Prisons, Iris Varela, shamefully bragged about the vigilante terror, when tweeting that the opposition is “scared” of the colectivos and called the armed thugs a “fundamental pillar in the defense of the homeland.”Using civilian militias to shoot students and beat protestors is only one tool in Maduro’s repressive apparatus. Other tools have come at the hands of one of Venezuela’s top benefactors — China. According to Jane’s Defense Weekly, at least two Chinese-made military systems have recently been battle tested on the streets of Venezuela.The first is the Norinco VN-4 armored personnel carrier that has been recently deployed by the Bolivarian National Guard to patrol Venezuelan neighborhoods and intimidate its residents. The VN-4 is a multi-role, light armored vehicle with a light machine gun mounted on top. Venezuela purchased 141 of these armored vehicles in 2012 for this type of contingency, and they are now rolling through the streets of Venezuela in the face of the protests. The other system is the Shaanxi Y-8C military transport aircraft, of which Venezuela purchased eight from China for $353 million back in 2011. These Y-8C aircraft were seen on the tarmac of several Venezuelan airports last month, made public through an array of photos posted on Twitter that claimed Cuban Special Forces were disembarking this Chinese-made aircraft.While Venezuela’s Interior Minister denied the use of Cuban troops on Venezuelan soil, there is plenty of open source evidence to refute his claim. Some estimates approximate as many as 50,000 Cuban personnel in Venezuela, with a close hand on everything from immigration systems to training civilian militias, to providing personal protection to Nicolás Maduro. With protests spiraling out of Maduro’s control, Cuba placed several hundred of its paramilitary troops on two-hour flights from Havana to Caracas, embedding their infamous Avispas Negras (“Black Wasps”) in Venezuela’s national security apparatus. Several eyewitness accounts have spotted Cuban agents on the streets of Venezuela disguised in military and police uniforms.  Both Cuba and China have a large stake in maintaining the Venezuelan regime, and their incentives are simple — oil. Cuba imports approximately 115,000 barrels of oil a day (much at no cost) from Venezuela to avoid a complete economic calamity on the island. While China has invested billions of dollars into the Venezuelan economy in exchange for an agreed-upon 600,000 barrels of oil a day (at well below market value) over ten years.While having the world’s largest oil deposits has attracted some, having one of the largest arms markets in the region brought Russia to the table. The Latin American arms market is estimated to reach about $50 billion in the next decade, with Russia hoping to capture a significant market share. Venezuela has provided the gateway for Russian ambitions in this market, buying 76 percent of the total Russian arms sales to the region.The recent unrest in Venezuela can only strengthen this relationship.While Nicolás Maduro was repressing student protestors, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced Moscow’s plans to install military bases in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, among five other non-Latin American countries.A few days later, on February 26th, a Russian Vishnya-class intelligence ship, the Viktor Leonov CCB-175, was identified in the Havana harbor, just hours from Venezuela. This spy ship arrived unannounced, fully equipped with electronic eavesdropping equipment and weaponry. That same day, several Russian-made surface-to-air missiles were relocated from the Venezuelan military industrial hub of Maracay, to the capital of Caracas. These particular missiles, the S-125 Pechora 2M, were sold to Venezuela by Russia in 2009, and delivered to the Bolivarian Republic as recently as a couple weeks before the mass mobilizations began.These low altitude surface-to-air missiles are the same kind of anti-aircraft weapons that Vladimir Putin sold to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which limited the option of placing a “no-fly” zone over Syria as Assad unleashed chemical weapons on his people. The repositioning of the Pechora missiles to Caracas is an ominous indication that the repression in Venezuela will get much worse if the protests continue.Nicolás Maduro is right in that Venezuelans should be wary of foreign intervention on their soil, but frankly the United States is the least likely candidate to take such action. Whether it’s the oil interests of Cuba and China, or the potential loss of a launch pad for Russia and Iran, Venezuelans need to worry much more about Maduro’s allies who, if things get worse, may send aircraft carriers to the Caribbean coast of Venezuela—or perhaps they already have?  While Maduro’s claims of foreign intervention stand in sharp contrast to U.S. inattention to events in the Americas for well over a decade, the growing intervention of Cuba, China, Russia and Iran has long posed a clear and present danger to the countries of the region, and by all evidence is now being used to repress the Venezuelan people themselves.Joseph M.

Paul defends Bush on immigration but says US 'can't invite the whole world' FILE: April 1, 2014: Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.APSen. Rand Paul says potential White House rival Jeb Bush was inarticulate when he described immigrants who come to the United States illegally as committing an "act of love."In an interview that aired Sunday, Paul said that those immigrants "are not bad people" but added the United States "can't invite the whole world" inside its borders.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTPaul, the Kentucky Republican eyeing a 2016 campaign, says Bush should have kept his focus on controlling the U.S. borders.Bush, a former Florida governor, says the GOP cannot demonize immigrants and should show compassion. He described illegal immigration as an "act of love" by people trying to provide for their families. Paul was interviewed on ABC's "This Week" during a visit to early nominating New Hampshire.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul Says GOP Must Appeal To Hispanics, Get âBeyond Deportationâ Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul told fellow Republicans on Tuesday that the future of their party depends on them connecting with Hispanics in a more empathetic way and on getting in front of immigration reform â a message that further signals his flirtation with a 2016 presidential run.âIf we are to change peopleâs attitudes toward â¦ the Republican Party, we have to show up and we have to have something to say,â Paul told a small group of conservatives gathered at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. âI hope to be part of that dialogue.âThis certainly was not the first time that Paul, since being elected to the Senate in 2010, has attempted to connect with Hispanics and other minorities.However, Republicansâ interest in his policy vision and his vision for broadening the party base continues to grow as he ascends in the very, very early 2016 polls and travels the country. Recent stops have included those in Democrat-heavy Detroit and at the University of California, Berkeley.Paul said Tuesday that Republicans need to focus on such issues as reforming the countryâs work visa system and improving educational and employment opportunities for minorities.However, the GOP must first make clear it is not âjust the party of deportation,â he argued.âThe bottom line is that the Hispanic community â¦ is not going to hear us until we get beyond that issue,â Paul told attendees at a symposium sponsored by the conservative Media Research Center and the American Principles Project. âTheyâre not going to care whether we go to the same church or have the same values or believe in the same kind of future of the country until we get beyond that. â¦ Weâve got to get beyond deportation to get to the rest of the issues.âHe attempted to highlight his point, in part, by noting that 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney at one point touted the idea of self-deportation, and won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.Paul, 51, expressed some optimism about Congress accomplishing some type of immigration reform this year, particularly one expanding the countryâs work visa program.He called the expansion of visas for high-tech workers âa no-brainer.âPaul spoke as his profile continues to rise as a potential 2016 contender, and amid efforts to court donors, assemble a nationwide support network and win the confidence of Washington Republicans wary of his less-mainstream, more-libertarian views.Paulâs message also comes amid criticism that neither party has really gone beyond election-year efforts to win the support of Hispanics.Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, told the Newseum audience that conservatives and Republicans âhavenât been very consistentâ in their effort.âAnd we donât need to pander to them like the left,â he said.Paul said a lack of empathy among Republicans has hurt efforts to connect with minorities and the working class and that Democrats have always been better in this area.âIâve been saying over and over that the Republican Party cannot win until itâs more diverse, until it looks like the rest of America,â he said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Phoenix judge who spared life of dog that mauled boy will decide where animal will live PHOENIX –  A Phoenix judge who spared the life of a pit bull that mauled a 4-year-old boy earlier this year was expected to decide Tuesday where the animal will spend the rest of its life.Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffin had declared the dog vicious at a hearing a month ago but declined to have him euthanized after animal-rights advocates came to its defense. Instead, she ordered the dog — named Mickey — to be neutered and defanged and gave the Lexus Project, a New York-based animal-rights group and the dog's trustee, 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take him.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has offered to house the dog at a no-kill shelter operated by his office. The sheriff, who is known nationally for his tough stance on immigration and whose office regularly investigates animal abuse cases, is expected to testify at the hearing.Attorney John Schill, a lawyer who argued on behalf of the dog, said putting Mickey in the sheriff's shelter for the rest of his life is an acceptable option.The trust will pick up the costs of caring for the dog, Schill said.The Feb. 20 attack left 4-year-old Kevin Vicente with a broken eye socket and jaw, and the boy has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him.The case touched off a polarizing Internet debate on mercy, blame and animal violence, leading to candlelight vigils and riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. Donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for Kevin since the dog bit the boy in the face.A woman who says her dog was previously killed by Mickey filed a vicious-dog court petition that started the court case.Animal advocates say both the dog and boy are victims and a baby sitter watching the child was negligent in letting him play near the animal. They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up. 
Pitbull Guilty Of Mauling Boy Gets Life Sentence In Animal Shelter PHOENIX (AP) –  A judge ruled Tuesday that a pit bull that mauled a 4-year-old boy earlier this year will spend the rest of its life in an animal shelter set up in an old jail by the sheriff for metropolitan Phoenix.Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffith said the dog named Mickey will be housed in the no-kill shelter opened in 2000 by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an animal lover who offered to take in the 4-year-old pit bull.Griffith had declared the dog vicious at a hearing a month ago but declined to have him euthanized after animal-rights advocates came to its defense. Instead, she ordered Mickey to be neutered and defanged and gave the Lexus Project, a New York-based animal-rights group and the dog's trustee, 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take him. The judge said the dog could not be put up for adoption.The Feb. 20 attack left 4-year-old Kevin Vicente with a broken eye socket and jaw, and the boy has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him.The case touched off a polarizing Internet debate on mercy, blame and animal violence, leading to candlelight vigils and riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter.

Arpaio denies those claims.At the dog's hearing, the question was raised of what would become of the animal if Arpaio is no longer sheriff."I expect to be the sheriff forever," the 81-year-old sheriff quipped.The judge pressed Arpaio on what would happen to the animals in his shelter if a future sheriff were to end the shelter program. Arpaio answered that any sheriff who would close such a program wouldn't get re-elected.A supporter of the dog, Veronica Lee, said Mickey will be able to enjoy more freedoms in Arpaio's shelter than at another county facility where he's currently being held."Today, justice was served for Mickey," she said.Griffith also denied a request from a lawyer representing the dog to rescind her order that Mickey be defanged.Attorney John Schill said it would make more sense to give the $2,500 the procedure costs to the injured child's family. Schill said the defanging wouldn't result in the dog losing his canine teeth, but rather they would be cut down and capped to match the height of the other teeth."Kevin's injuries are so vast and so devastating that $2,500 is really just a drop in the bucket," Griffith said, adding that she doesn't want the dog to harm another person.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Pope John Paul II Canonization: Mixed Legacy For Charismatic Catholic Leader To some Latinos, he is the most beloved pontiff of the 20th century because he used his powerful pulpit to support immigrants and oppressed war-torn nations.But others take a darker view, criticizing him for his failure to respond aggressively to one of the worst crisis in the recent history of the church – the sexual abuse scandal – and for failing to back grass roots movements in Latin America fighting repression.The canonization on Sunday of Pope John Paul II, the magnetic Catholic leader who sparked impassioned feelings, has stirred an array of reactions among Catholics in the United States. Elected to the papacy in 1978, Pope John Paul II was the longest serving leader of the Roman Catholic Church in the 20th century and earned a canonization quicker than any other pontiff, leading many in the church to ardently defend him against attacks by some scholars and critics.  “That is going to be the judgment of history looking at his papacy with a longer lens,” the Rev. David Garcia, the director of the Old Spanish Missions at the Archdiocese of San Antonio told Fox News Latino of the late pope’s legacy. “We’re still too close to this issue.”During his time at the helm of the Vatican, immigration in the U.S. was not the hot button political issue it is today, but Pope John Paul II made a concerted effort to speak out against the exploitation of undocumented immigrants even while saying that illegal immigration is something that needs to be stopped. Much like his stance toward refugees from war-torn countries, the pope looked at the issue of immigration on a global scale.Garcia and other clergymen mentioned Pope John Paul II’s frequent trips to Latin America – especially Mexico – and his devotion to the Virgin Mary as one reason why many Latinos in the U.S. feel such a strong connection to him. Outside of his trips to his home country of Poland – along with France and the U.S. – Pope John Paul II visited Mexico more than any other country in the world and, in 1999, declared the Virgin of Guadalupe to be the patroness of the Americas.“It was widely known that Mexico was one of his favorite countries,” Garcia said. “And his devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe endeared him to not only Mexicans, but also the large Mexican-American population living in the U.S.”During his time at the helm of the Vatican, immigration in the U.S. was not the hot-button political issue it is today, but Pope John Paul II made a concerted effort to speak out against the exploitation of undocumented immigrants – even while saying that illegal immigration is something that needs to be stopped. Much like his stance toward refugees from war-torn countries, the pope looked at the issue of immigration on a global scale.“Illegal immigration should be prevented, but it is also essential to combat vigorously the criminal activities which exploit illegal immigrants,” Pope John Paull II said during a message on World Migration day in 1995. “The Church considers the problem of illegal migrants from the standpoint of Christ, who died to gather together the dispersed children of God, to rehabilitate the marginalized and to bring close those who are distant; in order to integrate all within a communion that is not based on ethnic, cultural or social membership, but on the common justice.”While his words were praised by human rights groups, many immigrants in the U.S. and Central America argued that the pontiff was not practicing what he preached.In El Salvador and the Salvadoran community in the U.S., many lay people and clergy felt disenchanted with the Church and scoffed at Pope John Paul II’s clampdown on liberation theology – the political movement in Roman Catholicism that began in the 1960s and interprets Church teaching in relation to a freeing from unjust economic, political, or social conditions.They also felt the Vatican ignored Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was eventually assassinated inside his church, when he pleaded for condemnation of the country’s death squads in the 1980s.“There is not a big level of support for John Paul among the Salvadoran people because he effectively squashed liberation theology,” Chris Tirres, an assistant professor of religion at DePaul University, told Fox News Latino.In his final years in the Vatican, Pope John Paull II was hit with a two-fold blow of declining health and the explosive sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Catholic Church, worrying some in the church that his image and legacy would be tarnished by problems that were ostensibly out of his control.But many say Pope John Paul II should be judged mainly as an inspiring religious leader whose magnetism and powerful charisma drew many to the Catholic Church.“Overall, he was someone who kept the faith at the heart of every matter and tried to reach those in the community who were in need,” said Father Juan Molina of the United State Conference of Catholic Bishops.Follow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino     
The Pope, The President: Obama, Fading Rock Star, Meets With Icon On The Rise The meeting Thursday between President Barack Obama and Pope Francis will bring together two masters of charisma – two men who have blazed trails.The man who became the first African-American to be president of the United States will sit down with the Argentinian man who became the first Catholic pope from the Americas, and the first Jesuit.Indeed, Obama and Francis, who will meet at the Vatican, have much in common.Their words and actions reverberate around the world. Francis was the 2013 Time Magazine Person of the Year. Obama was the 2012 and 2008 Person of the Year. Francis was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Obama was awarded it.They both have made the poor and less fortunate a priority, with Pope Francis eschewing many of the gilded trappings of the papacy and doing such things as personally calling those whose struggles he learns about, and sending out a Vatican envoy to meet with the destitute.Obama has denounced income inequality, and has pushed for a higher minimum wage.The president has made a point of praising the pope’s emphasis on the poor, and according to a White House spokesman who discussed the impending meeting with the press, the president “looks forward to discussing with Pope Francis their shared commitment to fighting poverty and growing inequality.”The pope is enjoying high popularity, while the president's has plunged.Francis has an 85 percent approval rating among American Catholics and a 63 percent approval rating among all Americans, according to the survey by the Saint Leo (Fla.) University Polling Institute. Obama, in his second term as president, has seen his overall approval rating dip to 47 percent as he battles criticism over his healthcare plan and immigration.Pope Francis is known for his concern for migrants, and Obama will be meeting with him as pressure is building on him to curb the record rate of deportations that have taken place during his tenure. In fact, on Wednesday, members of a California group of advocates who want comprehensive immigration reform were in Rome and personally asked the pope to raise the issue of immigration reform with Obama.But one issue that is generating a great deal of attention, and that would be extremely sensitive, observers say, is the controversial mandate in the Affordable Care Act that calls for contraception coverage by employers, which many Catholic parishioners and bishops, and conservatives of other faiths, have denounced.“Hopefully tomorrow's meeting won't just be a photo-op used to promote President Obama's political agenda,” said Maureen Ferguson, senior policy advisor with The Catholic Association, to Fox News Latino, “but rather an opportunity to focus on the pope's challenge to our ‘throwaway culture’ to help the all the vulnerable – be they the poor, the unborn child in the womb, or the elderly.”Ferguson said she is fairly certain the pope will raise the subject of the contraception mandate in Obama’s healthcare plan. Opponents say it forces religious institutions to facilitate contraception, which is contrary to their faith, and therefore violates their right to religious freedom.“The issue of religious freedom is likely to be discussed since just yesterday the president's administration was arguing at the Supreme Court that the government can force people to violate their faith under threat of massive fines,” she said, “a sharp narrowing of our country's conception of the free exercise of religion. The president is being sued in the largest religious liberty lawsuit of its kind because of his hostile actions towards Catholics and other people of faith. So, yes, I'd expect that to come up.”The Rev. Gerald P. Fogarty, S.J., a professor of religious studies and history at the University of Virginia, said more than anything, the meeting between Obama and Francis will be significant.“It’s symbolic, but it’s an important symbol,” said Fogarty, who specializes in American Catholic history and Vatican-American relations. “The pope is a leader different than any other leader. It’s reached a state [for the role of a pope] that no president can go near Italy without meeting the pope.”As for what impact the meeting could have, particularly as far as Obama, whose popularity has taken a plunge in polls, Fogarty guessed the president would deftly handle any awkward moments or topics that might arise.“There’s tension between Obama and the [Catholic] bishops,” Fogarty said, “and many Catholics believe he hates Catholics.”“One reason the president is having this meeting is to try to bridge those gaps,” Fogarty said, “to bring the dialogue to another level, between the government and church leaders in this country.”Both men are gregarious and known for their personal charm, Fogarty noted, but they’ll be addressing each other through translators, which will color the chemistry that may emerge between them.Should the pope express his disapproval of the contraceptive coverage mandate and abortion rights, Fogarty said, the president likely will respond in a smooth way.“He’s got very shrewd advisers,” Fogarty said, who no doubt have prepared the president for these potentially delicate topics and moments in the meeting.Basically, he added, the two share a strong fundamental view of society’s responsibility to the less fortunate.“They agree on immigration, the pope would agree on sanctions against Russia, and that may come up, and the Church supports social programs, basically big government,” he said.While the pope, however, has taken what many would call a liberal view of many issues, he remains at the core conservative about such things as abortion and gay marriage.“I think in his simplistic analysis of the Church, President Obama has probably bought the radical left's caricature of the pope as some sort of revolutionary leader who is going to change Church doctrine of matters of morality,” said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, “and may think the pope can give him cover to some of his leftist policies. "He will be very disappointed, however. Pope Francis is a man of the people no doubt. A great pastor. But, like his predecessors, when it comes to Church doctrine he is totally orthodox."The Associated Press contributed to this report.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
President Obama Addresses Low Turnout Of Latino Voters In Midterm Elections With a strong potential for Republicans, who are a majority in the House, to take control of the Senate as well in the November midterm elections, President Obama had stern words for Latino and black voters.They donât step up to the plate, he said, in midterm elections. And thatâs a big reason that Democrats donât do well in these elections, he said."Our voters are younger, more unmarried women, more African-American and Latino voters," Obama said at a fundraising event in Houston on Wednesday for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to The Washington Post. "They get excited about general elections; they don't get as excited about midterm elections."Blacks and Latinos reliably cast their votes in presidential elections, Obama noted, but added: âWe have this congenital disease, which is in midterm elections we don't vote at the same rates."The Post said that Obamaâs comments echoed the findings of a recent poll that showed that Latinos and blacks were less excited than Republicans in general about voting this year.Latinos, blacks and Asians turned out in big numbers in the last two presidential elections.Latinos gave Obama 70 percent of their vote, Asian-Americans gave him 71 percent, and African-Americans gave him more than 90 percent.Obama has told Democrats not to get too comfortable during mid-terms elections. Republicans have been hoping that the problems with Obamacare will hurt Democrats in November.Contests in North Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Michigan and Louisiana will help determine control of the Senate, according to Roll Call.Obama also addressed immigration at the fundraiser, which drew about 60 people and was held at the home of a trial lawyer.The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill last year, but the effort has stalled in the House, where a conservative GOP faction has vowed not to support any measure that would give undocumented immigrants a chance to obtain legal status.âWe got a bipartisan vote out of the Senate, and yet we cannot even get a vote in the House of Representativesâ¦ not because it doesnât make sense,â he said. âItâs not because thereâs some serious dispute or technical difference in terms of policy.  It has to do with politics.âFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
President Calls Cesar Chavez 'American Hero' Who Held U.S. To Its 'Lofty Ideals' In his opening remarks Wednesday before a White House screening of a movie about Cesar Chavez, President Obama called the labor rights leader “an American hero” determined to make sure the United States “lived up to its lofty ideals.”The film,directed by Diego Luna,stars Michael Pena as Chavez. The movie opens on March 28.In a room of about 100 people, including actresses Rosario Dawson and America Ferrera, labor leader Dolores Huerta, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and relatives of Chavez, Obama touted Chavez’s can-do spirit.“This movie, this film tells the story of a man guided by an enormous faith — faith in a righteous cause and a loving God, and the dignity of every human being,” Obama said. “And it reminds us how throughout our history that faith has been tested, and that it falls to ordinary Americans, ordinary people, to fight and restore that faith.”  “Cesar himself said that he spent his first 20 years working as an organizer without a single major victory,” the president said. “But he never gave up. He kept on going, and the world is a better place because he did.”Obama, who then drew parallels to his current fight to get Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law and raise the minimum wage, said Chavez provided a great lesson for everyone.“No matter how long the odds, you keep going, fueled by a simple creed — sí, se puede,” he said.The president did not stay to watch the film, but told the crowd he would view it while his wife and daughters are traveling in China.In 2012, Obama announced the creation of a monument in California to honor Chavez, who died in 1993.The Cesar E. Chavez National Monument, which includes 120 acres, became the first to honor a Latino born later than the 1700s.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Princeton Police: We're Not Going To Cooperate With Federal Immigration Agents Weeks after federal immigration officials raided a home in Princeton, N.J., bypassing a routine courtesy of informing local police in advance, the town’s authorities are assuring residents that they are not involved in immigration enforcement.The Princeton Police Department is issuing an official resolution that establishes its policy of not taking part in raids by federal immigration agents. The department also has adopted a policy of not checking the immigration status of people who are arrested for non-violent crimes, according to the Daily Princetonian, the student newspaper.The move comes after some members of the town council urged the department to clarify the boundaries between their duties and those of federal immigration agents, the publication said.Princeton Police Capt. Nick Sutter said, according to the Princetonian, that the resolution’s objective was to drive home the point in town, which is home to a growing undocumented population, that law enforcement officials “are not all the same.”“We [as local police] have a different charge than the federal authorities do,” Sutter added.In September, agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency charged with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants, raided a Princeton home looking for a resident named Jose Ramirez. The man’s roommate called local police to let them know what had happened.Sutter said that he did not want residents to lump together ICE agents and local police officers. Princeton officials have expressed concern that such confusion in the immigrant community can compromise the trust that people need to have in order to report a crime when they are victims or witnesses.The resolution, Sutter said, was meant “to increase the trust and acceptance of the police department in all the communities.”As efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system have stalled in Congress, and deportations occur at record rates under the Obama administration, several local jurisdictions around the country have adopted policies of not turning over people to ICE who may be in the country illegally.Princeton, at the urging of active immigrant advocacy groups, also has taken other steps to reach out to undocumented residents.In 2010, local officials began issuing community identification cards that undocumented residents could use in town for identification.Though the cards are not considered government IDs, they were endorsed by the local police department and the Mercer County sheriff’s office.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Prominent Immigration Activist Eliseo Medina Arrested In Miami Veteran labor organizer and immigration reform advocate Eliseo Medina was arrested here Friday after attempting to enter the offices of Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.).Medina, a leader of the "Fast for Families" caravan that is touring the country to demand an end to deportations, was arrested for trespassing, Jose Seiglie, deputy police chief in the Miami suburb of Doral, told Efe.The former secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union joined House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Joe Garcia (D-Fla.) earlier Friday for an immigration reform event at Miami's Florida International University.Pelosi, Garcia and Medina made an appeal to the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives to allow a vote on the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed last June by the Senate.Medina and other activists later tried to enter a building Doral that houses the South Florida offices of Diaz-Balart and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.When police showed up and told the activists to leave the property, all but Medina complied, Seiglie said.Medina faces only misdemeanor charges and can expect to be released within 16 hours, Seiglie said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Prosecutorial discretion rarely used in immigration cases U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rarely makes use of prosecutorial discretion to close immigration cases, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse said Thursday).ICE invoked prosecutorial discretion in only 6.7 percent of cases between October 2012 and March 2014, according to TRAC's analysis of official statistics.A June 2011 policy directive instructed ICE agents to concentrate enforcement efforts on undocumented immigrants who have criminal records or otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety, while using prosecutorial discretion, or PD, to close cases involving other categories of migrants."Overall PD usage has hovered in the 6 to 8 percent range for months, though its use varies widely by location," TRAC, which is based at Syracuse University, said in its report.At immigration courts in San Antonio, Las Vegas and Newark, New Jersey, ICE has used this criterion in a range of 3-4 percent of cases, while the level drops below 3 percent in the immigration courts of Houston, Buffalo and El Paso, Texas.Other immigration courts, like those of Tucson and Seattle, have seen a PD closure rate of 30 percent over the past 18 months, according to the report.On various occasions in the course of many years, the Supreme court has recognized that the decision of a government agency either not to proceed or not to enforce the law, either by means of a civil or criminal suit, is a decision to be taken at the absolute discretion of the agency.Due to immigration reform being blocked in the House of Representatives, President Barack Obama made a commitment to getting immigration law applied in a "more human" way.Since President Obama entered the White House in January 2009, the average annual number of deportations up to fiscal year 2013 (last Sept. 30) was 400,000, double the 200,000 in 2007, the highest number during the two terms of President George W. Bush.Pro-immigrant organizations estimate that the number of deportations was more than 2 million under Obama. EFE 
Prospective 2016 Presidential Candidates Start Testing The Waters When asked about whether he’s got an eye on the 2016 presidential race, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz likes to say: "My focus is entirely on the U.S. Senate."At the same time, he’s made moves that have made many skeptical about his insistence that he’s not thinking about running in 2016.The Tea Party Republican from Texas has made the obligatory pilgrimage to that shrine of presidential campaigning – Iowa, whose caucuses are the opening act of the nomination contest. In fact, Cruz has gone four times in the last eight months.His fellow Republican, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who, like Cruz, is Cuban-American, also has been coy about his 2016 plans.But he, too, has engaged in activities that has many convinced that he’s aiming for the Oval Office.Rubio has made political appearances in Iowa, and he also has put himself at the forefront of several national and international policy debates.Last year, he took a lead role in bipartisan Senate efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform. His high profile on that issue made him a fixture on Sunday morning news shows.He shrank from the spotlight by design, however, after he drew fire from conservatives for backing the provision in a Senate immigration measure – which passed in June – that allowed for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.Now, he's back in the spotlight, this time assailing President Obama for his handling of Russia and Ukraine, and for being too passive over the Venezuelan government’s strong-arm treatment of protesters who have criticized its policies.Indeed, the two senators are examples of how just about everyone thinking about running for president is kicking it into gear now, slowpokes included.For months, many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been rubbing shoulders with donors, networking with party leaders, getting on TV and otherwise auditioning for the contest ahead, especially on the Republican side.Their pace is picking up. A few are even admitting now what has been obvious for eons: They're interested in the presidency, even if they aren't ready to commit.Others have avoided the usual pathways, for reasons that make sense to them even if their inscrutability exasperates others. "This is the time to show a little self-restraint," one of them, Jeb Bush, said back in November.But that was then. He's shed some of that restraint now.Hillary Rodham Clinton's inscrutability has bottlenecked the Democratic contest because several may decide not to run if she does. Asked in March, for the umpteenth time, about what she's going to do, she responded in her practiced coy fashion. "Give me your name and number," she cracked to a college student imploring her to run. "Obviously, thinking about all kinds of decisions."But she's been picking up her activities, too. Ready for Hillary, a super PAC, has been busy on her behalf in early organizing. The question remains: When will Hillary be ready for Hillary?What's clear is that springtime has arrived in 2016 presidential politics. Much more is going on since The Associated Press last took a broad look at who is doing what to get ready for a potential campaign.Here's a summary of the main players.For the Democrats, they are Vice President Joe Biden; Clinton, the former secretary of state; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo; and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.For the Republicans: Cruz, the Texas Republican senator, Rubio, the Florida Republican senator, Bush, the former Florida governor; New Jersey Gov.

After being largely absent from the airwaves for more than a year, Biden has resumed frequent interviews, including a TV blitz the morning after the State of the Union and a CNN interview aboard an Amtrak train. He even dished on his skin care routine and his wife's oddball pranks during an interview with Rachael Ray to promote the health care law. But not a Sunday news show fixture.Clinton: No. But late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed her in March. Appeared with Obama on CBS' "60 Minutes" in January to talk about tenure as secretary of state; gave interview to Barbara Walters late in 2013.Cuomo: No. Prefers radio.O'Malley: Getting back in the swing. January 2014 Sunday news show appearance on CNN was first in months, followed by CBS in February.RepublicansBush: Blanketed the five Sunday shows one day in March 2013 to plug his book on immigration, a few appearances other times.Christie: Not so much since traffic scandal surfaced. Before that, liked to cut up on late-night TV. Four Sunday news shows after his 2013 re-election.Cruz: Yes, several Sunday news show appearances already this year, plenty last year. Frequent guest on Fox News and CNN.Jindal: No, only a couple of Sunday news show appearances since 2012 election.Paul: Leader of the chattering pack with more than a dozen Sunday talk show appearances since 2012 election. Fast out of the 2014 gate with Jan. 5 appearance on ABC. Frequent guest on news networks, especially Fox.Perry: Raising his profile lately, making several national TV appearances while starring in flood of media spots in California designed to persuade businesses based there to move to Texas. Only a few Sunday talk show appearances since 2012 election, including one in February with three other governors.Rubio: Staying on par with most rivals in Sunday news show appearances.

Frequent guest on news networks.Ryan: Many Sunday news show appearances since 2012 election. Occasional guest on network news.Santorum: Plugged Christmas movie on "The Colbert Report," Fox News, MSNBC and more. Radio, too. Teamed up with Democrat Howard Dean as sparring partners for debates on the air and with audiences.Walker: Already on the Sunday news show scoreboard for 2014. Half dozen or so Sunday news show appearances since 2012 election. Also, Piers Morgan, Lou Dobbs, more national TV interviews.___ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING: For voters who want to support doers, not just talkers.DemocratsBiden: Leading Obama's review of federal job-training programs. Point man on gun control, which failed. Lots on foreign policy. Negotiated fiscal cliff deal. December 2013 trip to Asia put him front and center in regional dispute over China's new air defense zone.Clinton: Record as secretary of state, senator and first lady. Recent initiatives to help children's health and education and status of women.Cuomo: 2014 budget proposal calls for tax cuts for businesses, homeowners and renters. In 2013, pushed through nation's first gun-control law after the Newtown, Conn., school massacre. Led New York's effort to legalize same-sex marriage in 2011. Minimum wage boost, on-time budgets, teacher standards.O'Malley: Toughened gun laws, repealed death penalty, saw voters approve gay marriage after he got behind legislation to approve it, set up a framework to develop offshore wind power, won legislative approval in April of minimum wage increase, a 2014 priority.RepublicansBush: As Florida governor, revamped state educational system, cut taxes, managed state through hurricanes.Cruz: Leading force in dispute that partly shut the government, 21-hour Senate speech against Obama's health law. Argued before U.S. Supreme Court nine times, with eight of those coming while he was Texas' longest-serving solicitor general, between 2003 and 2008.Christie: Won November 2013 re-election, becoming first Republican to earn more than 50 percent of New Jersey vote in quarter-century. Led state's response to Superstorm Sandy. Agreed to expand state's Medicaid program under the new health law while some other Republican governors have refused to do so. Vetoed a bill that would have sanctioned gay marriage, but declined to appeal a court ruling that legalized it.Jindal: Privatized much of Louisiana's Medicaid program, shrank public hospital system, signed statewide voucher program that covers private school tuition for certain students. Signed abortion restrictions, fought liberalization of adoption law, making it impossible for gay couples to adopt jointly. Hurricane and Gulf oil spill disaster response.Paul: One-man, nearly 13-hour Senate filibuster to protest drone policy put him at forefront of civil liberties debate.Perry: "Texas Miracle" job-creation boom has seen state create a third of the net new jobs nationwide over last decade, although Texas has disproportionately high percentage of hourly workers earning minimum wage or less. Helped muscle through new abortion restrictions.Rubio: Broker of Senate immigration overhaul, though he's gone quiet on the issue. Early leader of effort to link financing of health care law to government shutdown. Working with anti-abortion groups on Senate version of bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks.Ryan: Negotiated December 2013 bipartisan budget deal that scaled back across-the-board spending cuts, drawing contrast with potential rivals who opposed it. Budget-hawk record to be judged on. Emerging as influential moderate on immigration.Santorum: Making Christian-themed, family-friendly movies at the moment; record from Senate days.Walker: Curbs on public service unions became national flashpoint, but he won the effort — and the recall election that followed.___TAKE A NATIONAL STAND: Effective state governance is nice but leaders must build national stature on issues of the day.DemocratsBiden: Eclectic. Guns, violence against women, gay rights, veterans.Clinton: Eclectic. 2013 speeches focused on the economy, housing, opportunities for women, voting rights.Cuomo: Environmentalists nationally and the energy industry are closely watching his pending decision whether to allow fracking in upstate New York counties near the Pennsylvania line.O'Malley: The liberal checklist: more spending on education, infrastructure, transportation; supports same-sex marriage, immigration reform, repealing death penalty, pushes environmental protections.RepublicansBush: Education, immigration, economy.Christie: Moderate on the reach and functions of government; bipartisanship.Cruz: Anti-Obama's health care law, pushes broader tea party agenda.Jindal: A record of privatization to show he means government should be trimmed, happy to carry a social conservative banner.Paul: Tea party plus. Fiscal conservative, criticizes surveillance state. Praised Supreme Court gay marriage ruling as one that avoids "culture war." Health law scold. Joining in 2014 with liberal lawmakers and others in effort to roll back some mandatory minimum sentences and give judges more flexibility in fitting punishment to crime.Perry: Prominent voice on conservative issues since before the birth of the tea party. Wants to ban all abortion in Texas, relax environmental regulations, boost states' rights; opposes gay marriage.Rubio: 2014 initiative on poverty calls for federal wage supplements for some low-wage workers instead of earned income tax credit. Economy, abortion, tea party fiscal conservatism; immigration liberalization if he decides to get back to it. Another voice against health care law.Ryan: Cutting spending, taking on entitlements, rolling back Obama's health law. Anti-poverty initiative this year.Santorum: Social conservative activism goes way back. Focus on blue-collar economic opportunity.Walker: Fiscal stewardship, from a GOP point of view. Tough guy against the unions and liberal defenders of the status quo. Says GOP in Congress is the party of no.___BAGGAGE TO CHECK: It's never too early to deal with skeletons in the closet; rivals will be rattling them soon enough.DemocratsBiden: Flubs, fibs, age. Deflection: "I am who I am." Saddled by Obama's low approval ratings.Clinton: Benghazi, Libya; polarizing when political, age. GOP wants to pin blame on her for vulnerability of U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya that came under deadly attack in 2012. In long-confidential documents from Bill Clinton's administration, advisers urged her to "be real" and "humanize" herself, revealing concerns about her authenticity as a public figure.Cuomo: New York economy is dragging, his poll numbers have sunk, went through public and bitter divorce with Kerry Kennedy, daughter of late Sen. Robert Kennedy, in 2005.O'Malley: State-run health insurance exchange website was an expensive bust, prompting officials to make an embarrassing switch in April to one based on Connecticut's. Contraband- and drug-smuggling scheme at state-run Baltimore City Detention Center that resulted in 44 people being indicted has state lawmakers looking to make reforms. Has record of raising taxes that could be challenged by less liberal Democrats, never mind Republicans.RepublicansBush: The Bush factor. Does the country want a Bush dynasty after presidents George H. W. and George W.? Some education and immigration positions are out of step with the right.Christie: If you have to declare "I am not a bully," you've got a problem. Apologized in January 2014 for highway lane closures apparently ordered by his aides as retribution against a mayor who did not endorse him for re-election. Also fired his deputy chief of staff and denied knowledge of the machinations. Episode deepened questions about what Christie, or those around him, will do to win, and contributed to a significant drop in his poll standings. Investigations continue.Cruz: Reputation as a hotheaded upstart, also part of his appeal. Polarizing within his party. Also comes with birther baggage: Questions have been raised in some quarters about his constitutional standing to become president because of his birth in Canada, to a Cuban father and American mother. Deflection: Promised last summer to renounce Canadian citizenship, but hasn't.Jindal: Ambitious plan to replace state's personal and corporate taxes with higher sales taxes flopped, delivered dud of a speech when given juicy platform of responding to Obama's first presidential address to Congress in 2009. Deflection: Poking fun at himself. Jindal administration's award of a $200 million Medicaid contract is under investigation by state and federal grand juries.Paul: Dear old dad: Must move beyond Ron Paul's fringe reputation. Bridge-burning in Congress endears him to tea party, could bite him otherwise. Deflection: GOP outreach to minorities. The Washington Times canceled his column after he was found to have used passages from other people in his speeches and writings as if they were his own. Deflection: Promising proper citations and footnotes for his pronouncements "if it will make people leave me the hell alone."Perry: "Oops!" Memories of his stumbling 2012 campaign, a quick progression from a front-runner to flameout. Deflection: Poked fun at himself for forgetting in a GOP debate one of the federal departments he would close as president, Energy.Rubio: Rift with tea party constituency on immigration, "a real trial for me." Deflection: Go aggressive on a matter of common ground, which he did in pledging to take apart the health law. And stop talking about immigration. Response to Obama's 2013 State of the Union speech was remembered only for his clumsy reach for water. Deflection: Made fun of himself.Ryan: Budget axe cuts both ways — catnip to conservatives but people want their Medicare. Carries stigma of 2012 election loss as running mate. Tea party not happy with his late 2013 budget deal. Comments in March about cultural "tailspin" in inner cities struck some as veiled racism. Deflection: Called his remark "inarticulate."Santorum: Overshadowed by newer conservative figures. Deflection: Being overshadowed means being an underdog, and he can thrive at that. Feisty 2012 campaign became the biggest threat to Romney's march to the nomination.Walker: Some things that give him huge appeal with GOP conservatives — taking on unions, most notably — would whip up Democratic critics in general election. Wisconsin has lagged in job creation. Release of emails in February shed light on criminal investigation into whether Walker's aides were illegally doing campaign work for the 2010 governor's election while being paid as county employees. Walker, then a county executive, wasn't charged but the episode has proved a distraction.___RUN SHADOW CAMPAIGN: One way to run without running is to have a political action committee to promote ideas or other candidates for office, or to hire advisers who can switch to a campaign when the time comes.DemocratsBiden: Constrained by his current job, but tapped longtime adviser and former lobbyist Steve Ricchetti to be his new chief of staff; maintains close contact with political advisers past and present.Clinton: Ready for Hillary super PAC set up by supporters is laying groundwork, so are others. Several old Clinton hands are advising the group, including Craig T. Smith and Harold Ickes.Cuomo: Overshadowed by Clinton's shadow campaign. Considered a likely contender if Clinton ends up not running.O'Malley: Set up a PAC called O'Say Can You See and hired two people for fundraising and communications.RepublicansBush: He's a Bush, so he's got connections. Sally Bradshaw, chief of staff when he was governor, is his go-to political person.Cruz: Has leadership PAC, Jobs Growth and Economic Freedom. Has been one of the largest beneficiaries of Jim DeMint's Senate Conservatives Fund and has gotten millions of dollars and grassroots logistical support from the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and Ending Spending PAC. Heritage Action PAC helped sponsor Cruz's summer anti-health-law trip around Texas and country. Chief of staff Chip Roy ghostwrote Perry's 2010 book about federal overreach.Christie: Republican Governors Association chairmanship allows him to grow his national profile with voters and party officials with regular travel and key appearances. Began building broad coalition of donors through his national fundraising tour in spring 2013. But the shadow of the traffic scandal still hangs over his shadow campaign.Jindal: Created Washington-based nonprofit, America Next, in October 2013 to push policy ideas nationally. For executive director, tapped Jill Neunaber, who worked on Romney's presidential campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire. In March created PAC to help conservative candidates.Paul: Has formidable leadership PAC called Rand PAC, has maintained ties to father's political network in early primary states and benefits from strong tea party support.Perry: Created Americans for Economic Freedom PAC in fall 2013 to raise his profile again, help him test the waters and broadcast ads promoting Republican leadership around the country. Group used more than $200,000 left over from the PAC that raised millions for his 2012 campaign.Rubio: Expects to begin more aggressive travel to early voting states in 2014. Reclaim America PAC led by former deputy chief of staff, Terry Sullivan, veteran of South Carolina politics, expected to be active behind GOP candidates across country in 2014 midterms.Ryan: His Prosperity Action PAC.Santorum: Keeps in touch with chief supporters of his winning 2012 Iowa caucus campaign, giving him a leg up on a campaign organization in that state.Walker: Consults with top Republican governor strategists such as Phil Musser and Nick Ayers.___GET WITH IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA: A must for spreading ideas, poking competitors, raising money, organizing events and showing a personal side, though often a very canned version.DemocratsBiden: Not active on Facebook, occasional contributor to his office's vigorous Twitter account.Clinton: More than 1 million followers on Twitter, her preferred social media outlet.Cuomo: Few if any personal tweets; Facebook also generated primarily by staff.O'Malley: On Twitter, standard governor's fare but promotes rare appearances by his Celtic rock band, O'Malley's March, for which he sings and plays guitar, banjo and tin whistle. On Facebook, his PAC-generated page is more active than official governor's account.RepublicansBush: Tweets and posts many Wall Street Journal stories, education thoughts and some Bush family doings.Christie: More engaged in Twitter ("It was great to be able to visit with the owners of Rossi's Rent-A-Rama in Ortley today.") than Facebook.Cruz: Active on Facebook and Twitter, much content is pumped out by staff.Jindal: Active on Twitter and on Facebook, where he lists among favorite books, "John Henry Newman: A Biography," about recently canonized British cardinal and sage. Also favors James Bond movies.Paul: Aggressive. Bragged on Twitter in June that he'd attracted more than 1 million likes for his Facebook page, where he lists his own books as his favorites.Perry: Active. One popular tweet was accidental — from his pocket, he said — and consisted of "I." Followers jumped in to complete his sentence. One offered: "I ... really like Obamacare." (He doesn't.) Facebook appears staff-generated.Rubio: Aggressive, with large followings, appears to make personal use of Twitter more than staff-generated Facebook. Takes lots of shots at the health law. On Facebook, lists "Pulp Fiction" movie and "The Tudors" historical fiction TV series among favorites.Ryan: King of Facebook among potential rivals in both parties, with nearly 4.9 million likes. Seeks $10 donations for "Team Ryan" bumper stickers for his PAC and kisses a fish. Posts photo of Obama with his feet up on Oval Office desk. Commanding presence on Twitter, too, via an account associated with his PAC and another as congressman.Santorum: Active on Twitter and Facebook, where he relentlessly plugged his new movie and goes after the health law.Walker: Posts vigorously on Facebook and on his Twitter accounts. Many exclamation points. "Glad USDA is keeping cranberries on school menus. I drink several bottles of cranberry juice each day!" And, "Green Bay Packers signing Julius Peppers to a 3-year deal is HUGE!" Promotes policy achievements and his TV appearances, reflects on sports, pokes Obama.Based on reporting by The Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Pushing Away From Immigration, Marco Rubio Shifts To Backing Big Business And Job Creation WASHINGTON (AP) –  Pitching himself as an ally to Silicon Valley, presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio proposed giving cellphone companies more access to government-controlled airwaves and other pro-business initiatives he said would create "thousands upon thousands of high-paying jobs."In an appearance that detailed his "grand illustration of America's potential in the 21st century," the Florida Republican also pledged to defeat any efforts to limit access to the Internet and separately proposed allowing private businesses to work with government labs to develop new products. The business-friendly message comes as Rubio looks to shift focus away from a stalled bipartisan immigration overhaul he helped to craft and as he eyes potentially deep-pocketed donors."The world around us is changing quickly, and we have waited for far too long to change with it. We still have time to build the new American Century, but we do not have forever," Rubio said at an event organized through the Jack Kemp Foundation and hosted at Google's Washington headquarters.Rubio's remarks come as he is considering a White House campaign in 2016. Pitching himself as an ally to Silicon Valley's tech titans could help him raise campaign donations from that industry, which so far have been lacking.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Internet and computer industries have given Rubio and his leadership committee about $182,000 since 2009. He badly trails in donations from the telecommunications industry with just $8,500.Rubio's top backers to this point have been retirees, investment firms and conservative groups.Should Rubio formally enter the still-forming contest for the Republican nomination, an affinity among Silicon Valley — and its Wall Street investors — could be handy in raising the needed millions to make it through the first few states.Rubio's political brand has taken a hit since he helped negotiate a bipartisan immigration overhaul that cleared the Senate but stalled in the House. Conservatives grew wary of the measure, and the Republican-led House signaled the comprehensive Senate plan would go nowhere.The tech industry pushed hard for the immigration overhaul, seeing millions of potential in-demand high-skilled employees.Rubio didn't mention immigration during his remarks but was asked about it. He remained skeptical of suggestions that immigrants who are in the country illegally could stay in the United States permanently without any pathway to citizenship."How do we deal with the 12 million people who are here in a way that is realistic but in a way that is also responsible?" Rubio asked. "Are you willing to have 8 or 9 million people who are here permanently but are not citizens?""I don't think that's a good place for the country to be," Rubio said.At this weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference, an early confab where the party's strongest activists huddle to hear from potential presidential contenders, Rubio finished seventh place in a straw poll. A year earlier, he finished second.Now Rubio is trying to rehabilitate his image through a series of policy prescriptions. Monday's proposal was to make available wireless bandwidth currently controlled by the government to commercial wireless providers, such as AT&T or Sprint."Too much of the digital realm is blocked by unnecessary federal restrictions. The more spectrum and bandwidth we can open up to the private sector, the more jobs it can create," Rubio said, pledging to soon introduce a bill to permit that."The American economy will take off at a historic rate, it would create thousands upon thousands of high-paying jobs," he predicted.Rubio also said the United States must formalize its opposition to a proposal that would give the United Nations a greater role in governing the Internet. Rubio said the proposal is foolhardy and runs counter to the United States' goal of spreading democracy and human rights.Rubio's 40-minute slate of policy ideas included "an interstate energy pipeline system" to transport oil and natural gas from the fields to consumers. He also proposed ending the ban on crude oil exports that has been in place since the 1970s.Republicans have been highly critical of the United States' energy policies under President Barack Obama, claiming he has fought a "war on coal" and delayed a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline.Rubio acknowledged that energy production is up 15 percent since 2005 before adding it could be higher."Selling some of our vast energy resources will lead to explosive growth and higher paying jobs here at home," he said.And in a further nod to the tech sector, Rubio said he would continue to push bipartisan legislation that would make it easier for private companies to collaborate with government-funded labs at NASA, the Pentagon and the National Institutes of Health.Such collaboration could be worth billions to companies."Our network of national labs has also long been a leading source of research," Rubio said. "But they currently lack the ability to work with the private sector to translate this into American jobs."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Randy Quaid sues company that posted bond for his squatting arrest November 23, 2010. Actor Randy Quaid arrives at Canadian Immigration Court prior to a hearing in Vancouver, British Columbia.ReutersActor Randy Quaid has sued a suburban Indianapolis bond company that bailed Quaid and his wife out of jail after they were arrested on squatting charges in California in 2010.The Indianapolis Star reports the 63-year-old "Independence Day" star sued Carmel, Ind.-based American Surety in Hamilton County Court, saying the company posted two $50,000 bonds for the couple without being asked, obligating them to repay bonds that they hadn't requested.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTRandy and Evi Quaid were arrested in September 2010 on suspicion that they were living in the guest house of a Montecito, Calif., home they previously owned. Authorities said at the time the Quaids were suspected of causing more than $5,000 in damage.A month later, the Quaids were detained by immigration police in Vancouver after a California judge issued a bench warrant for their arrest. They missed a hearing scheduled for Oct. 18, 2010, but the Quaids say they were never notified that a court date had been set.American Surety posted two $50,000 bonds for the couple, but the Quaids contend in an April 10 Indiana court filing that they never authorized the company to issue the bonds."The Quaids did not enter into a written agreement with American or its agent to provide the $50,000 bonds and did not agree to pay any sums to American or its agent in exchange for the bonds," their attorney wrote in court documents.The couple is seeking unspecified damages for lost wages and emotional distress.American Surety and their lawyer had no immediate comment Friday.Randy Quaid, 63, is best-known for supporting roles in films such as "Independence Day" and "National Lampoon's Vacation." He is the older brother of Dennis Quaid.+ FollowFOX411 on Facebook 
Ranking GOP Lawmaker Says Party Would Support Deal To Boost Foreign Worker Visas The GOP chairman of the House Judiciary Committee says that his party would support expanding foreign worker programs as well as allowing younger undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States.Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said that Republicans in the House, where they have a majority, do not trust President Obama with a comprehensive immigration reform measure.The Daily Caller reported that at a meeting Thursday hosted by the National Journal, Goodlatte said: “Congress legislates, not the executive branch, and [Obama is] attempting to rewrite laws to suit what he perceives to be demand. It’s a mistake.”He said the GOP caucus felt a “lot of mistrust of the president.”Goodlatte said that Republicans would be willing to work with the White House on a plan that would tighten border enforcement, raise the number of foreign workers and help some younger immigrants legalize.In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure that both tightened enforcement and called for a path to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants. But the effort stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority and where there is resistance to any measure that would provide a path to legalize for undocumented immigrants.Among the Republicans who are adamant about not granting anyone who is here illegally a chance to legalize is Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who recently said that he would not support allowing undocumented immigrants who were brought as children and who want to join the military an opportunity to become legal residents."As soon as they raise their hand and say, 'I'm unlawfully present in the United States,' we're not going take your oath into the military, but we're going to take your deposition and we have a bus for you to Tijuana," he said, according to Breitbart News. "That's the law."Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) assailed the comment."This rhetoric is insulting, unacceptable and harmful," she said, according to published reports. "These most recent comments by my Republican colleagues are a new low in Republicans' attempts to insult Hispanics and the immigrant community and derail immigration reform."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
RaÃºl A. Reyes: Leave Justin Bieber Out Of The Immigration Debate With one raucous night of partying, Justin Bieber succeeded in turning the publicâs attention back to immigration policy. On Thursday, he was arrested for allegedly drag racing in a residential Miami Beach neighborhood. Cue the media frenzy. News outlets from ABC News to CNN to USA Today weighed in on whether Beiber, a Canadian national, should be deported. The New York Times compared Bieberâs latest brush with the law to the plight of undocumented immigrants.  Not so fast. Bringing Bieber into the immigration debate only clouds the issue. His status is unique and not at all illustrative of legal or undocumented immigrants. Using âThe Biebsâ to make points about immigration policy is a mistake.- RaÃºl A. ReyesFirst of all, Bieber is not an immigrant. According to The Hollywood Reporter, he is here on an O-1 visa, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service specifically designates a ânon-immigrant visa.â Think of it as an elite guest worker permit. O-1 visas are only available to individuals âwith extraordinary ability or achievement.â Whatever you think of Bieberâs âability,â his hit records and sold-out concerts qualify for him for this visa (Other recipient of O-1 visas include talk show host Piers Morgan and soccer superstar Pele). Secondly, Bieberâs alleged crimes do not make him eligible for deportation anyway. As Zeke Miller of Time Magazine rightly points out, âunder federal law only violent crimes and sentences longer than one year result in a re-evaluation of visa status.â Bieber was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, none of which would trigger such a re-evaluation. While Bieber has already hired celebrity lawyer Roy Black to defend him, most foreign nationals do not have anywhere near his financial resources. Thatâs why the knee-jerk response of deportation to any alleged crime by a foreign national can be so dangerous. It disregards the presumption of innocence, one of the cornerstones of our legal system. Even if we are talking about Bieber, playing into the mind-set of âdeport them allâ simply does not serve justice.     In The New York Times, Andrew Rosenthal opined that Bieberâs situation âis in a small way emblematic of the capricious, unbalanced and racially charged way in which immigration policy is conceived and enforced in this country.â Not really. There are hundreds of thousands of immigrants deported for much less than Bieberâs offenses, from the single father targeted for a missing license plate screw to the Arizona man who was tased at home while sleeping. These undocumented immigrants are far more emblematic of our broken immigration system than a 19-year-old international pop sensation. Yet because they are not celebrities, their stories are often ignored. Meanwhile, the Obama administration continues to deport an estimated 1,100 people a day.          True, nearly anything Bieber does generates headlines, and news organizations cannot be faulted for covering his antics. What is missing is an appropriate context for his behavior. Bieberâs situation is his own, the same as any other foreigner or immigrant. There are immigrants who commit heroic acts, like the New Mexico man who saved a child from kidnapping, and there are immigrants who commit horrific acts, like the New York man accused of killing his wife and children. No one person should be used as a symbol of all foreigners or immigrants, and certainly not a famous teenager who seems to be out of control.Besides, consider the critical questions surrounding immigration that deserve our attention. Should Congress pursue comprehensive reform, or a piecemeal approach to overhauling our immigration system?  Should undocumented immigrants be granted a path to citizenship? How can we stem future flows of unauthorized migrants? Focusing on Bieber's transgressions threatens to crowd these questions out of the public arena at a time when we desperately need consensus on policy solutions.  Justin Bieber did not ask to be the celebrity face for immigration reform, and he should not be turned into it. Letâs leave him out of our immigration debate.Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and columnist in New York City.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Reid on need for ObamaCare extension: People 'not educated' about Internet  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried to explain the Obama administration's latest decision to extend a key ObamaCare deadline by saying people just "are not educated on how to use the Internet." The explanation, which glossed over the myriad technical problems HealthCare.gov had for weeks after its October launch, came as the administration faced Republican criticism for a late-breaking decision to extend a looming deadline for some. Open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act federal exchanges is set to end March 31, but the Department of Health and Human Services will let those who start the application process before that date have a bit more time to finish. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTReid, and the Obama administration, will not call the change a "delay." "We have hundreds of thousands of people who tried to sign up and they didn't get through," Reid said during a press conference, before describing the difficulties people have with the Internet in general. "There are some people who are not like my grandchildren who can handle everything so easily on the Internet, and these people need a little extra time. ... The example they gave us is a 63-year-old woman came into the store and said, 'I almost got it. Every time I just about got there, it would cut me off.' We have a lot of people just like this through no fault of the Internet, but [because] people are not educated on how to use the Internet," he said. The administration has fixed many of the major issues with HealthCare.gov since its disastrous launch. But it continues to lag behind its enrollment goals. Giving people more time to sign up could boost those enrollment numbers. Officials made clear, though, that they will rely on the honor system with this extension. Those who come to the site after April 1 will have to attest that they were in line before that date. House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the move has rendered another ObamaCare deadline "meaningless." "The administration is now resorting to an honor system to enforce it. What the hell is this, a joke?" Boehner said Wednesday. "The administration has now handed out so many waivers, special favors and exemptions to help Democrats out politically ... it's basically become the legal equivalent of Swiss cheese," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The Health and Human Services Department Wednesday posted two documents that outline "special enrollment periods" for broad groups of people trying to access the new online health insurance markets. Those who've started an application, but weren't able to finish before the March 31 open enrollment deadline, would get a limited amount of time to sign up for coverage that would take effect May 1. Additionally, people with 10 general categories of "special" circumstances would also get extra time to apply -- up to 60 days. Categories include natural disasters, system errors related to immigration status, computer error messages due to technical difficulties, family situations involving domestic abuse, and other sorts of problems. "We won't close the door on those who tried to get covered and were not able to do so through no fault of their own," Julie Bataille, communications director for the health care rollout, told reporters. She deflected repeated questions on whether there is a hard deadline beyond which the administration won't take applications. Special enrollment periods are allowed under the health law, and standard for workplace insurance. But they are mainly used to accommodate changes in life circumstances. The administration announcement added to a perception of disarray that has dogged the health care overhaul from its early days. It also raised concerns about the potential for another round of technology problems like the ones that paralyzed HealthCare.gov after its Oct. 1 launch. How long the extension will last seems to depend on individual circumstances. HHS said it will process paper applications received by April 7. Those applying online may have more time, until April 15, the same as the tax filing deadline. People who are due tax refunds may be willing to put some of that money toward health care premiums. The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics

In 2002, he put $10,000 into a pension fund controlled by another friend, Clair Haycock. The payment gave Reid a sizable parcel of land in Bullhead City, Ariz. According to the Los Angeles Times, Reid purchased the land for one-tenth of its estimated value (and one-fortieth of what it had sold for a decade earlier). Two actions created suspicion afterward. First, Reid sponsored an $18 million earmark for a bridge that would connect Laughlin, Nev., and Bullhead City. This bridge would likely increase property values in the area. Reid also introduced legislation that would benefit Haycock’s lubricant company. Reid aides denied that his support for the earmark or lubricant dealer bill was related to the land purchase. By 2011, Reid’s initial $10,000 investment was valued at between $250,000 and $500,000.

The state is the only one where the general public still can't use an online enrollment system to sign up for coverage in one sitting … The website was supposed to go live Oct. 1, but Cover Oregon and the technology vendor that built it, Oracle Corp., have been unable to work out all the glitches. Instead, Oregonians must use a costly, time-consuming, hybrid paper-online process to sign up for insurance.

Some of it is clearly circumstance and events, but some of it is a direct result of statements or actions by the administration. Take for example, Secretary of State John Kerry on Russia and Ukraine yesterday. He said “the window is closing” on Russia. As Charles Krauthammer points out, Russia is poised for action with thousands of troops on Ukraine's border, continues to thumb its nose at the international community, and clearly has not listened to threats from the West. The window is closing on the West being able to stop him. Adding to that, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki tweeted this out: “The world stands #UnitedforUkraine. Let’s hope that the #Kremlin &@mfa_russia will live by the promise of hashtag.’ “The promise of hashtag”?

Remembering 'Maman Ashraf' -- a tribute to my grandmother, my Persian queen Lisa Daftari (L) and her grandmother.Courtesy Lisa DaftariThis week, I lost the most pivotal role model in my life. My grandmother. Ashraf Soufer Yeganeh, or "Maman Ashraf," as we affectionately knew her, was a strong, brilliant and determined Iranian matriarch.  She was ahead of her time for any society and a female maverick in her own. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTEven at 85, she understood global economics better than most of the analysts at Bloomberg or Forbes and could give you a better understanding of politics than any book or news report. She was a true sheerzan, or lioness, the term Iranians use to describe a bold and courageous woman. The irony is that Iranians of her time had a term for a woman of such valor, but no place for her in society. I have always said that had she been born into a different culture, she would have been among the ranks of Madeleine Albright, Golda Meir, or Rosa Parks. Nowadays she would hobnob with the likes of Hillary Clinton or Condoleezza Rice.Maman Ashraf sought equality and justice for women and religious minorities, often acting as a voice for the voiceless and a defender of the defenseless.Without any newspaper or magazine subscriptions or access to anything more than her weekly Persian radio shows, she was an expert on everything and understood the most complex of international issues. But instead of gaining a Ph.D. in politics or economics, her life circumstances made her a master in the kitchen and in child rearing. She was famous for her ghormeh sabzi (Persian green stew) and dolmeh (stuffed vegetables), but we grandchildren were partial to her impeccably golden tahdeeg (crispy rice). Just about anything she touched was delicious. We would always say, "even if grandma boils water, it’s just perfect." She had a gift. She did things with love and passion and one could taste, feel and hear it in everything she did.From a young age my grandmother’s exceptional qualities of leadership and strength were apparent. She was such a smart, sharp student that after having only completed sixth grade, they asked her to be a teacher at the school, essentially becoming a mentor to her peers. And this followed throughout her life. She was a leader and commanded the respect and admiration of everyone she met.  With no formal education, she was enlightened. Without any claims to religious observance, she was the most spiritual soul.  My grandmother was married by the age of 19, giving up teaching to be a full time mother and wife. Her maternal instincts were so strong, she immersed herself in this role, acknowledging that this was her true calling. She was selfless, loving and compassionate and did everything for her family and extended family. She gave birth to three beautiful children, and from the day Maman Ashraf became a mother, she utilized her strength and intelligence to guide her children and create the greatest possible lives for them.But her compassion and selflessness did not stop at her family. She lived to do charity work and to help others. Whenever anyone needed to raise money for a worthy cause, a surgery, a fund, my grandmother would lobby from one organization to another organization, even going from one living room to another living room, making appeals to raise money.When the Iranian Revolution occurred in 1979, my grandmother abandoned the Tehran she loved so much to come to New York, knowing life would never be the same in her native land.  It was hard to replace the beauty of Tehran with her new urban home. For years, my grandmother would still talk about her love for Tehran, the flowers, the nature, the smell of spring, and the unique taste of its fruits and vegetables.But even as she settled in a community in Queens, New York, she found plenty of opportunities where she could help others. As soon as she emigrated to the United States, she began to help fellow Iranian refugees with immigration advice, helping them settle with ease in the U.S.And soon enough, my grandmother and a few others saw the need for a community center in New York that would meet the needs of its fledgling Iranian expatriate community. She and a few others founded PARAS, an Iranian cultural center. My grandmother and her co-founders worked tirelessly to cook for fundraisers, and valuing the importance of family and marriage, my grandmother became the community’s most popular matchmaker, proud of the many successful matches she had made. The community loved and treasured her, often recognizing her dedication on International Women’s Day and Mother’s Day.From the day I was born, I spent a lot of time with my grandmother. Rumor has it, she even offered my mother to take me as a daughter. Regardless, I was her daughter.I remember as a toddler we would go to the center together, visit the sick together, and organize charity events together. I loved being her buddy. Now looking back, I realize that she wanted me to be a sheerzan (lioness) in training.Her method was always tough love. This applied to her children and grandchildren as well. She spoiled us with actions but never with words. Her words were often harsh, and strong, just as her heart was. My grandmother always believed a child’s manners were above all.But Maman Ashraf’s life was complex.  As contented as she was by her children and grandchildren, by the dinners and holidays, she died feeling unfulfilled, and perhaps this is the saddest part for me. She was an idealist. She had big dreams and real ways and ideas of realizing them, but the life she imagined and the one she was assigned were worlds apart. She was a resilient matriarch stuck in a society dominated by generations of traditional patriarchy.Everyone commended her on her courage, on her strength, but her contemporaries did not easily understand her. They would often say, “She should have been born a man,” or “She could work as well as a man.”  I never understood. If there are any should’s or could’s then I think the most appropriate hypothetical would be to wish my grandmother were born into a society and time that understood and appreciated her potential, one that respected her mind and ideas regardless of her gender.Maman Ashraf saw a lot of herself in me. She would always tell me that. She encouraged me to work, to become educated, and to continue to learn throughout life. She would always remind me... "Agar man mogheyat tou ro dashtam…”  (If only I had the opportunities you have…”)And maybe that’s why she continued to live in Queens, despite its very disparate character to her homeland. She saw the U.S. as a country full of opportunities for her children and grandchildren. Every Friday night as I would leave her home, she filled me with enough love and encouragement to send me out the door and followed up with frequent phone calls throughout the week to make sure I ate the food she packed for me. In reality, Maman Ashraf was fueling me with something much more valuable. Every time I heard her voice, I was reminded of the selfless sacrifices she made in shaping the lives of my family. She may have not realized her personal dreams, but she did succeed in teaching her progeny the values of courage, self-assurance and most importantly, resiliency.  And as I stood by her hospital bed the night before she passed away, I promised her, with my eyes and not my words, that I would continue to carry the torch and to be the lioness she had always wanted me to be.Rest in peace, Maman Ashraf. You will always be roaring in my heart.Lisa Daftari is a Fox News contributor specializing in Middle Eastern affairs. 
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: No Immigration Reform This Year U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart seemed, for a bit, to offer hope to proponents of comprehensive immigration reform that a stalled effort on the issue might finally get moving.Diaz-Balart, a Republican from South Florida, said in recent weeks that he was working on a measure that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants, a move likely not to sit well with some of his GOP colleagues.But now Diaz-Balart says that the House Republicans, who have the majority in the chamber, are not going to move forward on immigration in what remains of this year.“We have very few days available on the floor in the House, so I don’t think we’re going to be able to do it this year,” Diaz-Balart is quoted in The Washington Post as saying. “I’m hopeful that we can get to it early next year ... If we cannot get it done by early next year, then it’s clearly dead. It flatlines.”Diaz-Balart is the only remaining Republican in what had begun as a bipartisan House group working on immigration.House Republicans, particularly a small but influential conservative faction, has vowed not to be part of any measure that gives people who break immigration laws a chance to legalize their status.The bickering between the conservative lawmakers and others over giving undocumented immigrants any kind of break has been an obstacle in the House to moving forward on comprehensive immigration reform.In June, the Senate passed a bipartisan measure that at its core tightens border security, interior enforcement and provides a path to legal status for many of the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The GOP leadership in the House vowed not to rubber-stamp the Senate bill, and said that they preferred to deal with immigration in several, separate bill rather than an overarching one. President Obama said several times since starting his second term that he was counting on the passage of a comprehensive immigration bill by the end of this year. But the bickering over how to handle the issue in the House, as well as other matters – such as Syria, the partial government shutdown – that grabbed energy and attention away from it, made it increasingly unlikely that a bill would come to the floor for a vote in 2013.Those who were pushing for a measure, particularly one that would give the undocumented a chance to, as Diaz-Balart had put it, “get right with the law,” expressed exasperation over the lawmaker’s pessimism about a reform bill this year.“We are dismayed and confused that our GOP champion for immigrant rights has gratuitously given a death sentence to immigration reform,” said Maria Rodriguez, Executive Director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, in a statement. “Why hasn't he introduced a bill? Why hasn't he joined other GOP representatives such as our own U.S. Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen signing on to HR 15 [immigration bill]?”“Every day Speaker Boehner fails to bring reform to a vote on the House floor,” she said, “the dreams of 1200 families die. Diaz-Balart’s inaction is an accomplice to this tragedy. Immigration reform is not dead until we say so. The fact that they are ignoring the fastest growing electorate in the country will be felt in elections to come.”The Washington Post said it seems that the bill Diaz-Balart is working on will not be introduced until early 2014.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
New York Rep. Grimm indicted on federal fraud, tax charges Jan 2, 2013: Representative Michael Grimm (R-NY) talks to the media. (Reuters)New York Rep. Michael Grimm was indicted Monday on 20 counts of fraud and other charges relating to a Manhattan restaurant he owned and operated, accused by federal prosecutors of evading the IRS and making over $1 million in revenue "disappear." The Republican congressman, who is a former FBI agent, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Brooklyn. After he was arrested earlier in the day, Grimm was released on $400,000 bond. He was ordered to stay within the continental U.S., and surrender his passport by May 11. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"Michael Grimm made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it," U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said at a press conference detailing the charges. "And in doing so, he turned his back on every oath he had ever taken." Just hours after Justice Department officials unveiled the charges, Grimm vehemently defended himself against what he called a "political witch hunt."  "We're going to fight tooth and nail until I am fully exonerated," Grimm said outside the courthouse, flanked by his attorneys.  His attorneys would not discuss the charges against him, but the congressman vowed to stay in office and continue running for re-election in the fall. "I don't abandon my post," he said. He claimed the bright spot, after a lengthy FBI investigation, is that he now knows who his accusers are. Taking a defiant tone, Grimm described the case as a "vendetta" designed to get him out of office. Late Monday, Grimm sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying he was stepping down as a member of the House Financial Services Committee.CLICK TO READ THE INDICTMENT Grimm is a former FBI special agent and Marine Corps combat veteran. Justice Department officials highlighted this profile in describing the significance of the charges. "He broke our credo," FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos said. "In this 20-count indictment, Representative Grimm honored a new motto: fraud, perjury and obstruction." The indictment covered mail and wire fraud charges and charges pertaining to false federal tax returns. At the heart of the indictment was an alleged "scheme" to hide sales and wages at his Upper East Side restaurant, Healthalicious, which he ran from 2007 to 2010 before entering Congress. Prosecutors described a relatively simple scheme, where Grimm allegedly took cash from the register of his restaurant and used part of that to pay workers off the books. In doing so, he allegedly under-reported his revenue, "making over a million dollars simply disappear." Lynch described it as a "deliberate plan to systematically lie to every taxing authority to whom his business had an obligation to report."Grimm was also accused of hiring undocumented workers. The charges did not appear to focus on the financing of Grimm's 2010 congressional campaign, which was initially thought to be the focus of a long-running FBI investigation. According to The Washington Post, Healthalicious was fined $88,000 for not providing workers compensation to employees. Workers also reportedly accused the company of not following state wage laws and giving workers cash payments to skirt New York tax and business laws. The House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. That committee said it would defer its inquiry because of the separate Department of Justice investigation.Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol.After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, "Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony."Scotto protested, saying he was asking "a valid question."During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman who had been romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions. In that case, made public this month, the woman was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to Grimm's campaign by passing them through friends who agreed to have the donations listed under their names.The Associated Press contributed to this report. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Boehner says he's 'hell-bent' on passing immigration legislation this year April 17, 2014: Suspected illegal immigrants being detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents, in McAllen, Texas.APHouse Speaker John Boehner and his Republican leadership team are telling donors and industry groups that they want to pass immigration legislation this year, despite the reluctance of other party members to tackle the divisive issue before the November elections.Many lawmakers and activists have assumed the issue was off the table in an election year. But Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a recent Las Vegas fundraiser that he was "hell-bent on getting this done this year," two people in the room told The Wall Street Journal.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTA Boehner spokesman didn't dispute the account but said no action is possible until President Obama proves himself a trustworthy partner to Republicans.The news follows House Majority Leader Eric Cantor saying Wednesday after talking to Obama that the GOP-led chamber will not pass the immigration legislation passed this past summer by the Democrat-controlled Senate that includes a path to citizenship for millions of people living illegally in the United States. Critics of the plan say it is tantamount to amnesty.In addition, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said during a recent trip to Silicon Valley that action in 2014 was "entirely possible," likely in the form of votes this summer on five to seven immigration bills, Carl Guardino, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, who hosted his visit, told the newspaper.A Goodlatte spokeswoman declined to comment on the exchange.And Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., also is drafting legislation that would give qualifying undocumented immigrants legal status and the chance to apply for citizenship through existing channels. The bill includes border-security measures and an effort to clear the backlog of applications for permanent legal status, known as green cards.House leaders have told Mr. Diaz-Balart to have the legislation ready to go for possible debate in June or July, an aide said.Click for more from The Wall Street JournalDaily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Report: Deportations Quadrupled With Obama, Two-Thirds Were For Minor Offenses A new analysis of the record number of deportations during the Obama administration further reinforces claims that those who are removed from the country are overwhelmingly people who committed minor offenses or none at all.The New York Times says that since the beginning of President Barack Obama’s tenure, in 2008, two-thirds of the nearly 2 million people who have been deported had no criminal record or had committed minor offenses, such as traffic violations.One out of five, or about 394,000, had committed serious crimes, the Times found.The Times analysis involved government records, it said.Obama’s aggressive deportation approach has come under fire from advocates of more lenient immigration policies, who have been pushing for an overhaul of laws that would include a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.This weekend, groups against the aggressive deportation approach rallied in cities across the United States, calling on Obama to stop them and stop breaking up families.“The records show the largest increases were in deportations involving illegal immigrants whose most serious offense was listed as a traffic violation, including driving under the influence,” the Times story said. “Those cases more than quadrupled from 43,000 during the last five years of President George W. Bush’s administration to 193,000 during the five years Mr. Obama has been in office.”The research, which mirror the findings of other reviews of deportations under Obama, was conducted by various organizations and institutions, including Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) and the Immigration Policy Center.Indeed, in 2013 both TRAC and IPC found that contrary to Obama’s declaration in 2012 that deportation efforts would focus on serious criminals or national security targets, immigration officials were still going after people with minor offenses or no criminal history.“Despite claims by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that it prioritizes the apprehension of terrorists, violent criminals and gang members, the agency’s own deportation statistics do not bear this out,” said an IPC report last year. “Rather, most of the individuals being swept up by ICE and dropped into the U.S. deportation machine committed relatively minor, non-violent crimes or have no criminal histories at all.”Obama has met with Latino leaders, advocacy groups who back comprehensive immigration reform, and Congressional lawmakers who have criticized him over the deportations. He variously has told those with whom he’s met that he alone cannot change immigration policy, and that he will review his options for sidestepping Congress while legislation remains stalled there.Longtime observers have said Obama has tried to appease his critics on both sides of the immigration debate.One the one hand, they say, he has allowed a tough approach to enforcement in response to conservative lawmakers who say he has not done enough to deter illegal immigration. On the other hand, he has tried to remain in the good graces of Latino organizations and others by pledging to push for comprehensive immigration reform and, in particular, find a way to allow undocumented immigrants to legalize their status.The Times analysis, which looked at more than 3.2 million deportations over 10 years, found that during that period, Mexican men who were 35 years old or younger remained the most often deported.Also, people who re-entered illegally were deported at three times the rate – 188,000 – under Obama as they were under Bush.“It would have been better for the administration to state its enforcement intentions clearly and stand by them, rather than being willing to lean whichever way seemed politically expedient at any given moment,” said David Martin, a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, according to the Times. “They lost credibility on enforcement, despite all the deportations, while letting activists think they could always get another concession if they just blamed Obama. It was a pipe dream to think they could make everyone happy.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Report: Licenses for undocumented immigrants would improve public safety A report by the NC Budget & Tax Center reveals the economic and public safety benefits of issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants in the Tar Heel State.Upwards of 254,000 immigrants could benefit from a state law allowing undocumented foreigners to get a driver's license, the report says."More than 90 percent of North Carolinians use a car to get to work, either by driving alone or carpooling. Yet hundreds of thousands miss out on the opportunity to meet basic family needs and participate more fully in the state's economy," the BTC, a project of the NC Justice Center, says.Alexandra Forter Sirota, the report's author, estimated that at least $8.1 million would be earned by the state in collecting the $4 charge for providing a license to new drivers, something that would help to cover the processing costs.In addition, allowing undocumented immigrants to have licenses would save the state money, since estimates are that the losses incurred in traffic accidents involving unlicensed drivers could be reduced by $4.1 billion per year."When unauthorized immigrants have safe, legal access to transportation, it improves their ability to get to work regularly and on time and gives them greater opportunities to fully participate in local economies. This, in turn, benefits the state's economy," Sirota said.The report also emphasizes that a growing number of states - 12 since 2013 - have adopted policies that support the idea of issuing licenses to undocumented individuals.North Carolina stopped issuing licenses to residents who could not prove their legal immigration status in 2006 in part because many immigrants were coming to the state from elsewhere in the nation where they could not get licenses to acquire them here.More than 221,000 licenses were issued to undocumented people with a taxpayer identification number, but those have been expiring over the years leaving thousands of drivers without a legal document giving them permission to drive.The situation has resulted in undocumented people taking a risk by continuing to drive without a license and has exposed them to being arrested at any time.

Rep. Paul Ryan Says GOP Distrust In Obama Runs So Deeply That Immigration Reform Is Unlikely In 2014 WASHINGTON (AP) –  Days after House Republicans unveiled a roadmap for an overhaul of the nation's broken immigration system, one of its backers said legislation is unlikely to pass during this election year.Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said distrust of President Barack Obama runs so deep in the Republican caucus that he's skeptical the GOP-led House would pass any immigration measure. He said a plan that puts security first could only pass if lawmakers believe the administration would enforce it — an unlikely prospect given Republicans' deep opposition to Obama."This isn't a trust-but-verify, this is a verify-then-trust approach," Ryan said.Last week, House Republicans announced their broad concerns for any immigration overhaul but emphasized they would tackle the challenge bill-by-bill. Immigration legislation is a dicey political question for the GOP. The party's conservative base opposes any measure that would create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living here illegally, but many in the party worry that failing to act could drive many voters to Democratic candidates. In 2012, Obama won re-election with the backing of 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 73 percent of Asian voters. The issue is important to both blocs.Republicans have preemptively been trying to blame the White House for immigration legislation's failure, even before a House bill comes together. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said "there's a lot of distrust of this administration in implanting the law." And Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., last week warned that distrust of Obama would trump the desire to find a solution for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally."We just don't think government will enforce the law anyway," Rubio said, recounting conversations he's had with fellow Republicans.House Republicans are pushing a piecemeal approach to immigration that puts a priority on security before considering a pathway for those here illegally to earn citizenship. That strategy runs counter to a comprehensive bill, passed through the Senate seven months ago with bipartisan support, that includes a long and difficult pathway to citizenship.The White House, meanwhile returned to its position that any legislation must include a way for those living here illegally to earn citizenship and that the system cannot divide Americans into two classes — citizens and noncitizens."We ought to see a pathway to citizenship for people," White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said Sunday. "We don't want to have a permanent separation of classes or two permanent different classes of Americans in this country."Last week, Obama suggested that he's open to a legal status for immigration that falls short of citizenship, hinting he could find common ground with House Republicans."I'm going to do everything I can in the coming months to see if we can get this over the finish line," Obama said Friday.Obama's flexibility was a clear indication of the president's desire to secure an elusive legislative achievement before voters decide in the fall whether to hand him even more opposition in Congress. Republicans are expected to maintain their grip on the House and have a legitimate shot at grabbing the majority in the Senate.McDonough said the White House remains optimistic that legislation that includes citizenship could reach the president's desk: "We feel pretty good that we'll get a bill done this year."Not so, countered Ryan, the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2012."Here's the issue that all Republicans agree on: We don't trust the president to enforce the law," he added.Asked whether immigration legislation would make its way to Obama for him to sign into law, Ryan said he was skeptical: "I really don't know the answer to that question. That is clearly in doubt."Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican and son of immigrants, said Congress needs to address the "completely backwards system" not because it's good politics for the GOP but because it's the right thing to do."If the president had been serious about this the last five years, we'd be further along in this discussion," Jindal said. "But I think it's also right the American people are skeptical."Ryan spoke to ABC's "This Week." Cantor was interviewed on CBS' "Face the Nation." McDonough appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CBS. Jindal spoke to CNN's "State of the Union."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Republican senators slam Obama for ordering review of deportation program Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., center, accompanied by fellow GOP lawmakers, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 25, 2014, following a GOP caucus lunch.APWASHINGTON –  Twenty-two Republican senators sent a letter to President Obama on Thursday accusing his administration of displaying "an astonishing disregard for the Constitution" by considering administrative changes to the nation's deportations policy.  In a letter to the president, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and 21 of his colleagues said that changes under consideration would amount to "near complete abandonment of basic immigration enforcement." ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"Your actions demonstrate an astonishing disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the rights of American citizens and legal residents," read the letter signed by McConnell and other Republicans, including Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla.The Associated Press reported this week that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who is conducting a review ordered by Obama on how to make the administration's policy on deportations more humane, is weighing limiting removals of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who don't have serious criminal records. The change, if adopted, could shield tens of thousands of immigrants now removed each year solely because they committed repeat immigration violations, such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported, failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court date.With comprehensive immigration legislation stalled in the GOP-led House 10 months after Senate passage, Obama is under intense pressure from immigrant advocates to act on his own to curb deportations and allow some of the 11.5 million immigrants in the country illegally to stay here. The move would fall short of the sweeping changes sought by activists who want Obama to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups, such as the parents of any children born in the U.S. Thursday's letter, circulated by the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Republican, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, underscores the political risk in an election year as Republicans seize on the review as the latest example of presidential overreach."Our entire constitutional system is threatened when the executive branch suspends the law at its whim and our nation's sovereignty is imperiled when the commander in chief refuses to defend the integrity of its borders," the senators wrote. The senators complained that the administration's existing policies. Republicans already accuse Obama's administration of subverting the law through previous moves to give "prosecutorial discretion" to immigration agents."As a result of your policies, individuals here illegally who do not meet administration “priorities” are not only largely exempt from the law, but are released even if they come into contact with feder al law enforcement authorities," the letter said.In a statement, Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard didn't respond to the senators' complaints but said, "The secretary has undergone a very rigorous and inclusive process to best inform the review."Many activists want sweeping action by Obama to give legal certainty and work permits to millions more immigrants, like he did for those who arrived illegally as children and attended school or served in the military.But a senior administration official told The Wall Street Journal that no decisions have been made and that immigration activists are engaged in “extreme wishful thinking” about what they hope the president will decide to do.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Republicans Point To Obama's Unwillingness To Compromise As Immigration Reform's Likely Demise Republicans have renewed, and cranked up, their finger-pointing at President Barack Obama as the reason why immigration reform has not moved forward.On a round of media interviews this past weekend, Republican leaders said that despite his pledge – during his 2008 campaign for the presidency, and ever since then – that immigration reform is a priority for him, Obama actually is getting in the way of progress in Congress on the issue.The GOP's emerging plan on immigration is to intensify their criticism of the last two years of Obama as an untrustworthy leader and his administration as an unreliable enforcer of any laws that might be passed. Perhaps realizing the odds of finding a consensus on immigration are long, the Republicans have started telling voters that if the GOP-led House doesn't take action this election year, it is Obama's fault."If the president had been serious about this the last five years, we'd be further along in this discussion," Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, said Sunday.House Republicans last week unveiled a road map for an overhaul of the nation's broken immigration system that calls for increased border security, better law enforcement within the U.S. and a pathway to legal status — but not citizenship — for millions of adults who live in America unlawfully. The proposal requires those here illegally to pay back taxes and fines.But one of its backers, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said distrust of Obama poisons interest among some in his Republican caucus."Here's the issue that all Republicans agree on: We don't trust the president to enforce the law," said Ryan, his party's vice presidential nominee in 2012.Ryan said a plan that puts security first could only pass the House if lawmakers believe the administration would enforce it — an unlikely prospect given Republicans' deep opposition to Obama. The president's waivers for provisions in his 4-year-old health care law have increased suspicions among Republicans."This isn't a trust-but-verify, this is a verify-then-trust approach," Ryan said.Asked whether immigration legislation would make its way to Obama for him to sign into law, Ryan said he was skeptical: "I really don't know the answer to that question. That is clearly in doubt."The Senate last year passed a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that addressed border security, provided enforcement measures and offered a long and difficult path to citizenship for those living here illegally. The measure stalled in the GOP-led House, where leaders want to take a more piecemeal approach.In the meantime, Republicans have started uniting behind a message that Obama won't hold up his end of the bargain.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said "there's a lot of distrust of this administration in implanting the law."

Republic of Congo deports thousands to neighboring Congo for lack of immigration papers KINSHASA, Congo –  Officials say nearly 40,000 Congolese citizens have been deported from neighboring Republic of Congo because they did not have immigration papers.Kinshasa Governor Andre Kimbuta said Tuesday that the biggest wave of deportees had arrived the day before, when 6,000 people crossed the Congo River separating the two countries.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe deportations began two weeks ago and those affected are being held at a stadium in Kinshasa where the Red Cross has set up sanitation facilities.Many deportees have complained of mistreatment on the part of Republic of Congo forces carrying out the deportations.Hugues Ngouelondele, the mayor of the Republic of Congo capital of Brazzaville, said any police officers caught abusing civilians would face justice.

(AP Photo/Binsar Bakkara)The Associated PressSITTWE, Myanmar –  The two children stood on the beach, torn between land and sea.They couldn't go back to their tiny Muslim village in Myanmar's northwest Rakhine because it had been burned down by an angry Buddhist mob. In the chaos, they became separated from their family and gave up hope of finding them alive after seven months of searching.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe only way was forward. Hungry and scared, Mohamad Husein, 15, and his sister Senwara Begum, 9, climbed on board a rickety boat crammed with others fleeing home.They had no way of knowing they were among hundreds, if not thousands, of ethnic Rohingya children who have left Myanmar by sea since the country was first gripped by sectarian violence two years ago, or that they were joining one of the world's biggest boat exoduses since the Vietnam War.Despite pleas from the United Nations, which considers members of the religious minority among the most persecuted groups on earth, nearby countries shove them back to sea or bar them altogether."The sense of desperation and hopelessness is growing," warned Vivian Tan of the U.N. Refugee Agency.About 1.3 million Rohingya live in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country of 60 million that only recently emerged from decades of military rule. The government considers them illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh, though some families have lived here for generations.Since the transition to democracy began three years ago, Buddhist mobs have killed up to 280 Rohingya and forced more than 140,000 others from their homes. The violence, which first flared in mid-2012, has forced about 75,000 people to flee, according to Chris Lewa of the non-profit Arakan Project.Nearly 2,000 people have died or gone missing at sea during that time, she added. And women and children now make up 5 percent to 15 percent of those leaving,The Associated Press reported the children's story based on interviews and data from Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.Their small boat was packed with 63 people, including 14 children and 10 women. They baked in the sun and vomited from the waves.Nearly two weeks passed, and then a boat with at least a dozen Myanmar soldiers approached.They kicked and bludgeoned the Rohingya men with wooden planks and iron rods, several passengers said."Tell us, do you have your Allah?" one Rohingya survivor quoted the soldiers as saying. "There is no Allah!"They tied Mohamad's hands and lit a match, laughing as the smell of burnt flesh wafted from his blistering arm. Senwara watched helplessly.The beatings finally stopped after Mohamad suspected money changed hands, and the soldiers ordered the boat to leave. The government said the Navy denied seizing any ships during that period.The ship plodded on, but it was falling apart. A sarong stuffed in a hole could not stop water from bubbling through, and Senwara's sticky rice and bits of bread were gone. When they finally floated ashore in Thailand, she had no idea where she was.Up until a few years ago, Thailand towed migrants out to sea and left them, often with little or no food, water or fuel. But after an uproar, Thai authorities began giving basic supplies to migrants before sending them on.Sometimes, however, they direct the boats to traffickers, according to human rights groups. Those who cannot raise ransoms often escape or are sold as slaves onto fishing vessels.Royal Thai Navy spokesman Rear Adm. Karn Dee-ubon said the navy always follows humanitarian principles, but added that other Thai agencies could be involved.On shore, Mohamad and Senwara were given rice and dry fish and then put on another small boat without an engine. Thai troops pulled them far out to sea, cut the rope and left them to drift without food or water, survivors said. Senwara got sick after drinking sea water and eating ground-up wood.The next day, they spotted a fishing boat. It was from Indonesia.The world's most populous Muslim nation has been sympathetic to the Rohingya, but has not opened its doors to them. It only allows them to stay until they can be resettled elsewhere, which can take years. In the meantime, they are kept in overcrowded detention centers and shelters.The Indonesian and Malaysian governments fear that letting the Rohingya stay could lead to a greater influx of illegal migrants."At stake is national interest," said Yan Welly, an Indonesian immigration official. "A flood of immigrants could affect efforts in coping with problems of our own people."The number of Rohingya housed in Indonesia jumped from 439 in 2012 to 795 last year. About 20 percent of the children who arrived traveled alone, according to U.N. data.Some register with the U.N. Refugee Agency and wait to be resettled in another country, but no Rohingya in Indonesia were referred for placement last year.To avoid the long delay, thousands paid smugglers in the past to take them by boat to Australia's Christmas Island. But that country has shut its doors. It now transfers sea arrivals to Papua New Guinea or the tiny island of Nauru. It also tows vessels from its waters.Once in Indonesia, after nearly a month at sea, Mohamad and Senwara were transferred to a filthy detention center with about 300 people, double its capacity. A riot soon broke out there between the Rohingya and illegal Buddhist fishermen from Myanmar, and eight Buddhists were beaten to death.Senwara slept through the brawl in another area. When she awoke, her brother was gone.After a few months in jail with other Rohingya arrested from the fight, Mohamad was released due to his age and left for neighboring Malaysia.Around 33,000 Rohingya are registered in Malaysia and an equal number are undocumented, according to the Rohingya Society of Malaysia. Increasingly, migrants risk getting caught up in group arrests, and up to 1,000 have been detained in a nationwide crackdown, the Society said.Mohamad found illegal work as a street sweeper, earning about $70 a month, and now lives in a tiny hovel with about 17 other Rohingya men. He remains tortured with guilt for leaving his little sister behind.Soon after the detention center riot, Senwara was registered as an asylum seeker. She was moved to temporary U.N. housing in Medan, Indonesia, and taken in by a Rohingya woman. She remains hurt and angry for being left alone, and her heart aches for home.Senwara's parents didn't learn the children were safe until more than eight months after their village was burned.On that awful night, their mother, Anowar Begum, and father, Mohamad Idris, fled with two babies into a lake. Later, they searched frantically and found five more of their nine children. The family ended up in a squalid camp with tens of thousands of other homeless Rohingya near Rakhine state's capital, Sittwe. They had given up hope on Senwara and Mohamad by the time an unknown Rohingya called from Indonesia to say the children were safe.Today, 22 months after their separation, it's only through technology that the family, now scattered across three countries, can remain in touch.Mohamad, in Malaysia, watches a video clip of his sister playing soccer in Indonesia. Even as he breaks down, he cannot look away from the little girl on the screen.Back in Myanmar, Anowar stares at her daughter on a Skype video and sobs into her headscarf. Senwara wipes away her own tears in Indonesia as her father's weathered face trembles.They go through the questions every parent wants to know: Is she well? How is she doing in school? Is she getting enough to eat?Her father reminds her to be a good girl. He is desperate to see his children again, but believes they are better off far away. The family often goes hungry, and there's no money for medicine.When it's time to say goodbye, Senwara keeps staring at the screen, long after the faces are gone."I don't think I will ever be able to see my parents," she says, softly. "For the rest of my life."___Mason reported from Medan, Indonesia, McDowell reported from Alor Setar, Malaysia, and Bangkok.

Rosario Dawson thilled to play Dolores Huerta in "Cesar Chavez" In the film biography "Cesar Chavez," Rosario Dawson had the honor of playing one of the women who admires him most, Dolores Huerta - the righthand person for the union leader - who continues to be active at 83 and tweeted the actress to congratulate her on her performance."She's a woman who continues writing her own story, who is very active, who continues to collaborate with multiple causes. I had the privilege of getting to know her when we were at a meeting on immigration where she was with Maria Teresa Kumar (of Voto Latino) and politician Lawrence O'Donnell," Dawson told Efe in an interview.Diego Luna made the film more than 20 years after the death of the labor leader, who in the 1960s took up the struggle for the rights of Latino workers and founded the United Farm Workers, for which Huerta was co-founder and vice president.In this film, which opens in theaters on March 28 starring Michael Peña, America Ferrara and John Malkovich, Dawson has been able to synthesize her two careers: artist and activist.In the artistic area, she has transformed herself into one of the most influential Latinas in the United States thanks to her work in films like "Kids" and "25th hour," both containing extensive social content, as well as purely entertainment films like "Sin City" and "Death Proof."In the activist area, although she has taken up causes such as gay rights and the environment, her main focus of activity has been raising awareness among the Latino community about the importance of its members' votes via the Voto Latino organization.

(AP Photo/Sergei Grits, File)The Associated PressZHDANIVKA, Ukraine –  Moscow calls the detention center under construction near the Russian border a "fascist concentration camp." Inside the barbed-wire fences, the reality appears less ominous: It's an EU-funded project to hold asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, similar to other such detention centers across Europe.The accusation is one of the more outlandish in a relentless Kremlin-driven propaganda offensive that uses World War II-era terms and imagery to rail against Ukraine's fledging government. "Nazis," ''fascists" and "Fritzes" are some of the terms that Russia is hurling at Ukrainian authorities who took power after the ouster of the last elected president, a reversal in political fortunes that has led to pro-Western Ukrainian government in Kiev and a pro-Russian insurgency gaining intensity in the country's east.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIt's an effective tactic because of the emotional weight that World War II has in Russia. The Soviet victory against Hitler is the nation's single most powerful rallying cry. In evoking the ugliest words related to Nazi Germany, the Russian media loyal to President Vladimir Putin is galvanizing support for his aggressive stance toward Ukraine, both among his countrymen and among Russian-speakers in Ukraine's east.It's also a dangerous tactic, because the inflammatory propaganda may provoke the anti-Kiev opposition in the east.The propaganda assault began during the pro-Western Maidan protests late last year that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president in February: Russian state news media were quick to dismiss the protests as the work of Ukrainian neo-Nazis, a particularly loaded accusation because Ukrainian nationalists collaborating with the Nazis are blamed for horrific reprisal attacks during World War II. The Maidan movement did contain an ultranationalist element, known as the Right Sector, but its influence appears greatly amplified by the Russian media.Putin has set the national tone by eagerly using the word "Nazis" to refer to the protesters in Ukraine. Speaking at his annual April call-in show, Putin warned that "neo-Nazism is on the rise" in Ukraine.By invoking World War II imagery, the Kremlin is stirring a cauldron of emotion; millions of Russians were killed in battle or thrown into Nazi camps in a war that left no family unaffected."The only thing that truly unites the nation is the mythology of the Second World War and the idea of victory," said political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. "Putin appeals to that; there's nothing else to rally around."Arkady Mamontov, a TV journalist who also led the media assault against punk band Pussy Riot, broadcast footage of the Zhdanivka detention center, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the major eastern city of Donetsk, on his Sunday program and declared that Ukraine was constructing "fascist concentration camps" for pro-Russian activists rallying in eastern Ukrainian cities."There will be enough cells for everyone," Mamontov said as he walked along the barbed-wire fence. He failed to provide any evidence of it.On an unannounced visit to the facility, The Associated Press was given an extensive tour of the grounds, and found nothing to suggest it was not an ordinary detention center. There were rows of barracks under construction for 100 people, but no barred windows or watch-towers."We're not building any Auschwitz here," said Volodymyr Pashchenko, a Ukrainian official with the Turkish company building the facility. "This is not a prison. This is a center which is to provide normal accommodation to people who have fled to Europe or who have somehow ended up in Ukraine illegally."Pashchenko said his company secured the deal in 2010 to build the immigration detention center, which is being completed under an EU-funded project.There is a deep and dark history behind the anti-Ukrainian messages now emanating from Russia.When Nazi troops entered Ukraine in 1942, they enlisted local Ukrainians to fight for them and against the Soviet Union. The nationalist Ukrainian brigades that were formed saw themselves as patriots fighting for independence. But while serving under the Nazis, some participated in war crimes including extermination campaigns against Jews, Poles and fellow Ukrainians. Even after the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, bands of Ukrainian nationalists fought on in the forests against the Soviet re-occupation of Ukraine until finally subdued or annihilated by around 1948.Pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine are drawing inspiration from the Kremlin in pushing the Fascism narrative. "No to Fascism" banners flutter and wartime songs blare from loudspeakers in front of occupied government headquarters in the eastern city of Donetsk. One poster inside shows President Barack Obama's face with a Hitler mustache and the distinctive blond braids of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.Alarmist rumors have proliferated since Russia began calling the Ukraine leadership fascist. One popular claim is that the Kiev government has hatched a plan to "exterminate" Russian-speakers in the east. The rumors feed into Putin's argument that Moscow needs to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine."They already have it all planned out," said retired coal miner Volodymyr Chernenko. "In the social networks, they say that a partisan war should be waged, and they list the names of those whose throats should be slashed and who should be blown up."Russian news media regularly distort information to make it fit the black-and-white World War II mindset, condoning vigilante violence.Pro-Kremlin Life News television recently showed footage of gangs wearing St. George ribbons — the symbol of the pro-Russia movement — viciously beating marchers at a peaceful Ukrainian unity rally.Instead of condemning the brutality, the TV anchor announced: "Donetsk self-defense broke up a neo-Nazi march."Russian officials have gradually adopted the media's World War II rhetoric.The Russian foreign ministry quoted Mamontov's concentration camp report in a statement on the following day and went further, asking: "Is the Kiev regime going to throw discontented citizens from the country's south-east in there?"___Vasilyeva reported from Moscow.

San Antonio Mayor Asks For Immigrants To Be Protected From Deportation Austin, Texas –  The Obama administration should change its deportation policy to protect undocumented immigrants who have family members who are U.S. citizens, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro says."We should look at people who have been here for more than 10 years, who do not have a serious criminal record and who have family members who are United States citizens," Castro, one of the Democratic Party's highest-profile Latinos, said in an interview with EFE.The Mexican-American mayor urged the president to build on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects undocumented youth who would benefit from the long-stalled DREAM Act."My hope is that President Obama extends what he did with DACA for the DREAMers to ease deportations for people without serious criminal records who have families in the United States," Castro, 39, said.The mayor does not think it is necessary in the 2016 presidential election for Democrats to have a candidate for president or vice president who is Hispanic, but he is certain that, sometime during his lifetime, there will be a Latino in the Oval Office.While acknowledging that the Obama administration has options to reduce the number of deportations, which have already exceeded two million since 2009, the mayor believes that "the primary responsibility" for the plight of undocumented lies with Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives.Castro said that in San Antonio, the police chief has ordered officers not to inquire about residents' citizenship or immigration status.With 1.3 million people, 63 percent of them Hispanic, San Antonio is the seventh-most-populous city in the United States.Castro, the mayor of San Antonio since 2009, sees the Democratic Party as the logical and natural political grouping for the Hispanic community in the United States."The America of 2014 is better reflected in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party, but there is always room for more," he said regarding the presence of Latino politicians in responsible posts.The mayor's twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic member of Congress.The mayor does not think it is necessary in the 2016 presidential election for Democrats to have a candidate for president or vice president who is Hispanic, but he is certain that, sometime during his lifetime, there will be a Latino in the Oval Office.Nevertheless, he rules out seeing the name Julian Castro in the national political arena in 2016. He says he is planning to run for re-election in 2015 in San Antonio and, if he wins, he will remain in office until the end of his mandate in 2017. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Schumer offers answer to GOP’s fear on Obama and immigration: enact now, start law in 2017 FILE: Feb. 17, 2012: Sen. Chuck Schumer speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington.APNew York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer offered a compromise Sunday with House Republicans who say they cannot pass immigration reform legislation for fear President Obama won’t enforce the related laws -- pass the legislation now and enact it when the president leaves office."Let's enact the law this year, but simply not let it actually start until 2017, after President Obama's term is over,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTSchumer, who helped lead his chamber last summer in passing comprehensive reform legislation, dismissed the argument that Obama would not enforce tighter border security law and other related laws, as House Speaker John Boehner suggested last week.“There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws, and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," Boehner said Thursday, after months of saying he wanted to move ahead with reform and releasing a set of principles in late January outlining such a bill.”He and other Republicans point in part to the president’s recent vow to use executive orders to sidestep Congress, making recent changes to the Affordable Care Act and creating a program two years ago that defers deportation for roughly a half-million young people brought to the United State illegally as children.“I think that the rap against him -- that he won't enforce the law -- is false,” Schumer continued Sunday. “He's deported more people than any other president. But you could actually have the law start in 2017 without doing much violence to it.”How serious Schumer was about the proposal was unclear Sunday.Missouri GOP Rep. Roy Blunt told “Fox News Sunday” that the House reluctance has a lot to do with the “president's constantly talking about how he can use his pen and his telephone” to work around Congress.The Democrat-controlled Senate last year passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a 13-year path to citizenship for some of the estimated 11 million people now living illegally in the United States. The Republican-led House has instead proposed tighter border security first, then only legal status for illegal immigrants. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Senate Blocks Resolution Honoring Farm Worker Rights Leader Cesar Chavez Resolutions, which tend to be largely symbolic, often get the nod without much fanfare.But in bitterly divided Congress, even resolutions can run into opposition and bickering between Republicans and Democrats.So it was with a resolution pushed by Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, honoring the late labor rights leader Cesar Chavez.The proposed resolution noted that Chavez, who would have been 87 on March 31, started out in a poor farm worker family, had to leave school after the eighth grade to help his parents and rose to fame by fighting successfully for better farm working conditions, wages, housing and the elimination of child labor.But Republicans blocked it after Democrats refused their demand that they also include in the resolution mention of how Chavez pushed for tighter border security and saw undocumented immigrants as detrimental to U.S. workers.Menendez was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight’s comprehensive immigration bill, a bipartisan measure that passed in June and included stricter border security and expanded foreign worker visas.“Had [the Senate Gang of Eight bill] passed, it would have been adverse to farmworkers who are in this country working hard, needs pay raises and need better job opportunities,” said Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, as he blocked the resolution, according to Politico. “I think these are important parts of Mr. Chavez’s career.”Menendez fired off an angry statement after the resolution failed.“It’s really shameful that we can pass, you know, commemorative resolutions on some of the most insignificant things,” Menendez said. “But on the life of someone who changed the course of this country for millions of Latinos who understand that life and history and would want to see that life commemorated, that there can be continuing objections [for] eight years.”It long has been known that Chavez, indeed, felt strong opposition to undocumented immigrants, believing that they undermined U.S. workers and labor strikes.His cousin, Manuel Chavez, oversaw an effort called the “wet line,” which involved setting up dozens of tents along the U.S.-Mexico border and staffing them with about 300 members of the United Farm Workers, the union he helped found. The union workers stopped border crossers and tried to deter them from entering the U.S.Other labor unions, at the time, typically also opposed illegal immigration, seeing it as competition.But Chavez and other union officials later softened their stance – particularly as union membership declined – and backed amnesty programs and sought to recruit undocumented immigrants as union members.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Ex-DHS watchdog placed on leave after Senate probe says he altered reports  The official tasked with keeping watch over the Department of Homeland Security was instead watching out for senior officials he considered his "friends," according to a Senate probe. A subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released a scathing report on Thursday that effectively confirmed many of the ethical allegations that have trailed Charles Edwards ever since he resigned his post in December as acting DHS inspector general. The report determined that he "jeopardized the independence" of his office by socializing with senior DHS officials and had reports "altered or delayed" to accommodate the department he was supposed to oversee. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIn the wake of the report, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that Edwards, who after leaving the acting IG post took a different job at DHS, would be placed on administrative leave. The report also included, though did not confirm, allegations that Edwards' office sat on information about the 2012 Secret Service prostitution scandal that could "influence an election." "An Office of Inspector General is intended to be beyond reproach. The problems in that office were allowed to persist for far too long," Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said in a statement. Asked about the allegations on Thursday, Edwards told FoxNews.com his office "was independent" -- but he declined to comment further. Edwards' attorney David Lease claimed to FoxNews.com that the report is the product "of a predetermined investigation," and faulted lawmakers for declaring last year that his client acted improperly without giving him a chance to be interviewed. "The report is full of characterizations and supposition which are not supported by the record in this case," Lease said in a statement. "The report often cites to testimony or other materials which have been quoted out of context and provide a misleading impression. Mr. Edwards worked diligently to maintain the independence and integrity of the Office of the Inspector General during his tenure as Acting and Deputy Inspector General." The report paints the picture of an office torn apart by personal vendettas and political games. It included allegations that Edwards' office retaliated against workers who spoke out and, in the words of one unnamed official, that Edwards himself cultivated a "toxic, totally dysfunctional and oppressive" work environment. One official told Senate investigators that the work atmosphere was one of "complete terror." The report reviewed allegations of a coverup in the IG probe of the 2012 scandal where Secret Service agents were caught with prostitutes during a presidential visit to Colombia. FoxNews.com reported in September 2012 on allegations that White House advance team members may have been involved. Edwards himself later acknowledged that a hotel registry suggested two non-Secret Service personnel may have had contact with "foreign nationals" during that trip. One was a Defense Department employee "affiliated" with the White House Communication Agency and the other, he said at the time, "may have been" affiliated with the White House advance team. But the White House denied the claims, and Edwards' office did not pursue those leads because they were not DHS personnel. The Senate report could not substantiate claims that Edwards was involved in any changes to the IG report, but did determine that "certain information" from a draft report was "altered or removed" before the final release. The lead investigator told the subcommittee that he was directed by his supervisor "to delete derogatory information" -- information considered "potentially damaging to the administration."   According to the report, the same investigator said he told an internal review team that he had concerns with deleting this material because: "The DHS OIG was sitting on information that could influence an election." Edwards told the subcommittee, though, that any changes were made as part of the regular editing process. He and his assistant said no changes were politically motivated. The report also included allegations that the lead investigator was threatened. The Senate report detailed other audits and investigations. It claimed that Edwards released one report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement practices on the date desired by a senior DHS official. "Which day is good?" he emailed the DHS Acting Counsel, when asked when the report would come out. According to the report, Edwards had certain language removed from a separate audit report at the request of DHS officials. IG workers told congressional investigators that all along, Edwards was angling for the permanent IG post. It also said he socialized with senior officials over drinks and dinner and considered them "personal friends." The report also reviewed scattered allegations that surfaced last year, including claims that he violated "anti-nepotism laws" to employ his wife and used his own staff to work on school assignments. The report concluded he did not violate anti-nepotism laws, but did abuse agency resources by getting a staffer to work on his Ph.D. dissertation. The report said his acting chief of staff estimated she worked 20-25 hours on helping with his dissertation. Asked for comment on the case, the current DHS inspector general said in a statement that he appreciates the Senate subcommittee's efforts and those who cooperated with the probe. "This report, which examines a challenging era for DHS-OIG, contains valuable insights that my office will be taking into account as we move forward with our oversight mission," Inspector General John Roth said. At DHS, Johnson said late Thursday he has reviewed the report and has asked the Senate subcommittee's staff to brief him further. And he confirmed he has placed Edwards on leave. "I have placed the previous Acting Inspector General, who in December transitioned out of his position in the Inspector General's office and to a position in the Science and Technology Directorate, on administrative leave," Johnson said. "Other individuals who are apparently and allegedly implicated have already left DHS and if additional information comes to light, I will continue to take appropriate action." The office of former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano pushed back on the details in the Senate report. According to The Washington Post, her office said neither Napolitano nor her staff "ordered that anything be deleted" in the report on the Secret Service. FoxNews.com's Jana Winter contributed to this report. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
Senate Republican Leader Predicts No Immigration Reform In 2014 One of the highest ranking Republicans in Congress joined the chorus of pessimism about the likelihood of an immigration reform bill passing any time this year.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on Tuesday that the chances are remote for an agreement between the U.S. Senate, where Democrats hold a majority, and the House of Representatives, where the GOP holds say, happening in 2014 on the highly charged issue of immigration.His predictions come on the heels of a series of generally skeptical comments by Republicans leaders on the prospects for passage this year of an immigration reform bill.He based his comment on the leap years apart that both chambers are on various aspects of immigration reform.“I think we have sort of an irresolvable conflict here,” he told reporters, according to various media reports. “The Senate insists on comprehensive [legislation]. The House says it won’t go to conference with the Senate on comprehensive and wants to look at [it] step by step.“I don’t see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place,” he said.Last week, House GOP leaders released a set of what they termed “immigration principles,” a sort of mission statement on how immigration laws should be overhauled.Some of the principles in the one-page document sharply departed from long time hard-line stances on the issue, such as the ones that expressed support for allowing certain undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status.But the principles ran into resistance from the most conservative faction, which vows not to go along with any immigration reform provision that allows what they call amnesty, or a reward for lawbreakers.Republican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner, has sought to reassure his conservative colleagues by saying that any breaks for undocumented immigrants will not come before border security is tightened and interior enforcement is improved.Republicans in the House – where the fate of immigration reform largely lies at this point, with the Senate having reached a bipartisan agreement on the issue last year – have said they will not repeat the Senate approach to passing a sweeping bill, and instead prefer dealing with legislation in bits and pieces.The difference in philosophies about how to deal with immigration reform, McConnell said, is major stumbling block to making progress on coming up with a legislation that can be brought to the floor for a vote.Fellow Senate Republican, Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, echoed the sentiment that many Republicans will not come around to supporting a sweeping reform measure.“I think the problem isn’t so much the principles, it’s how legislation actually gets passed an we find consensus and that’s the challenge,” he said. “The Senate bill is a non-starter because it just reminds people of Obamacare, another big expensive bill with a lot of moving parts.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Senate Republicans Accuse Pres. Obama Of Disregarding Rule Of Law Over Deportation Issue U.S. Senate Republicans say President Barack Obama is neglecting immigration enforcement by considering significant changes to the way the country chooses whom to deport.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 21 other Republican senators are accusing President Obama of disregarding the rule of law and the Constitution by considering administrative changes to the nation's deportation policy.In a letter Thursday, the senators say changes under consideration would amount to "near complete abandonment of basic immigration enforcement."Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is weighing changes such as limiting the deportation of immigrants who are here illegally but have little or no criminal record.With comprehensive immigration reform legislation stalled in the House, Obama is under pressure from immigration activists who have grown increasingly frustrated by what they say is the president's refusal to use executive powers to change some key aspects of U.S. immigration policy.Thursday's letter, circulated by the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley, underscores the political risk as Republicans are seizing on the review as the latest example of presidential overreach.The change in deportations, if adopted following a review ordered by the president, could end up shielding many thousands of immigrants now repatriated each year because they have committed repeat immigration violations – such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported, failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court appearance.On the other hand, activists also want Obama to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups, such as the parents of children born in the U.S.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sen. Marco Rubio: Obama Has Lost All Credibility, No Chance For Immigration Reform While He's In Office Sen. Marco Rubio, a major player on immigration policy, said Wednesday that there was no chance now of passing a broad overhaul because Republicans have lost trust in President Barack Obama.The first-term Florida lawmaker, a potential White House contender in 2016, cited GOP concerns about whether the president could be trusted to enforce tough security requirements in the Senate's bipartisan immigration bill that Rubio helped write.Rubio said the Obama administration has lost credibility as a result of how it handled the 2012 attack against a U.S. outpost in Libya and accusations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups.Rubio said doubts about Obama and his team colored his conversations with lawmakers he had hoped to persuade to back the immigration overhaul, now stalled in the House."The central impediment to making progress on this issue was people would say to me, 'We understand that you put all this security stuff in the bill, but we don't think it matters and we just don't think government will enforce the law anyway,'" Rubio told reporters at a breakfast organized by The Wall Street Journal."'You can write whatever you want in that bill. But the federal government will not enforce the law.' As a result, they will just do the legalization part but they won't do the enforcement part."Rubio expressed his doubts as House Republican leaders were in the midst of reviving efforts to overhaul the immigration system with new broad policy principles. But they are facing a direct challenge from a GOP senator who is warning against a headlong rush toward reform.Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, delivered a 30-page package to all 232 House Republicans on Wednesday that offers a point-by-point rebuttal to the expected standards that House Speaker John Boehner and other leaders plan to circulate this week among GOP members at their annual retreat.Sessions warned of the negative impact of proposed changes to immigration policy on U.S. workers, taxpayers and the rule of law as the House leaders look at legalization for some of the 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Sessions and other opponents argue that legal status and work authorization still amounts to amnesty.The GOP starting point is a statement of principles that is expected to focus on border and interior security, legalization with the requirement that immigrants pay fines and back taxes, and ensuring that Obama enforces any law, according to lawmakers, congressional aides and outside advocates, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the principles being drafted.Republican leaders plan to circulate the principles on Thursday at the GOP caucus' retreat in Cambridge, Md.For his part, Rubio said Republicans told him they feared a repeat of President Ronald Reagan's immigration overhaul that gave about 3 million immigrants legal immigration status without following through with corresponding security improvements.Rubio said other lawmakers brought up controversies that have dogged the administration and been favorite lines of criticism among conservatives. They includes the rocky rollout of the new health law and the disclosures about surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency."They pointed to the IRS scandal and the Benghazi stuff and then the NSA revelations and then the 'Obamacare' decisions by this administration as evidence of how the government and this administration unilaterally decides which portions of the law to enforce and which ones not to enforce. And that further undermines," Rubio said.Conservatives have said Obama used the IRS to go after political enemies' tax-exempt statuses. IRS workers in a Cincinnati office singled out conservative political groups, such as tea party affiliates, in the spring of 2010 and continued to do so until 2012.IRS supervisors in Washington oversaw the targeting but there has been no evidence released so far that anyone outside the IRS knew about the targeting or directed it.As for Benghazi, four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed during the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission on Sept. 11, 2012.The circumstances of the attack and the administration's response remain a politically charged subject ahead of the 2014 elections, as well as the 2016 presidential election.Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack, is a possible Democratic presidential contender in 2016.The administration also has faced scrutiny from members of both parties over NSA spy programs disclosed when former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of documents in June.Finally, the administration has given reprieves to parts of his national health care law, which is sometimes called "Obamacare." That has led to accusations the administration is willing to ignore the law to curry favor with allies.Taken together, these issues have sown doubt among lawmakers that Obama could be trusted to enforce strict immigration provisions in the Senate-passed legislation, Rubio said.As for the House Republican effort to move forward on immigration, Rubio said: "The goal now is to reach a result. And reaching a result requires us to be realistic."Based on reporting by The Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sen. Rand Paul Says Jeb Bush Was Wrong To Defend Undocumented Immigrants Sen. Rand Paul, a potential 2016 presidential contender, took aim at another possible Oval Office candidate – Jeb Bush – over the former Florida governor’s recent comments defending undocumented immigrants.In an interview on ABC’s “This Week that aired Sunday, Paul said that Bush was inarticulate when he described immigrants who come to the United States illegally as committing an "act of love."Paul said that those immigrants "are not bad people" but added the United States "can't invite the whole world" inside its borders.Paul, the Kentucky Republican eyeing a 2016 campaign, says Bush should have kept his focus on controlling the U.S. borders.Bush says the GOP cannot demonize immigrants and should show compassion. He described illegal immigration as an "act of love" by people trying to provide for their families.Paul was interviewed on  "This Week" during a visit to early nominating New Hampshire.In a speech in New Hampshire, Paul said conservatives need a bold message to "hit those who haven't been listening" and to keep their political movement growing.The senator told an audience of conservatives there that the GOP cannot be "the party of fat cats, rich guys and Wall Street."Paul said conservatives must carry messages of justice, concern for unemployed workers and against government surveillance — if they want to attract new people to the movement, including young people, Hispanics and blacks.Paul said the conservative movement has never been about rich people or privilege, and that "we are the middle class."During the New Hampshire event on Saturday, Republicans eyeing the 2016 White House race battered President Barack Obama's health care law and nicked each other, auditioning before the high-profile gathering of conservatives, viewed by some political veterans as the campaign's unofficial start."It's the unofficial kickoff of the 2016 process," said Republican operative Mike Biundo, who managed Rick Santorum's last presidential campaign.A speaking program packed with potential presidential candidates weighed in on the House Republicans' controversial budget, the party's struggle with Hispanics, the GOP's future and the upcoming midterm elections while taking turns on a conference room stage facing hundreds of conservative activists gathered in New Hampshire's largest city.But the Republican Party's near-universal opposition to the president's health care law dominated the conversation just days after Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius resigned after leading the rocky rollout of the program derided as "Obamacare."Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared that one resignation is not enough. "We are going to repeal every single word of Obamacare," said the first-term senator and tea party favorite.Based on reporting by The Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sen. Rubio Says Jeb Bush Would Not Be Factor In His Decision To Run For President Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush long have been friends – but that is not likely to get in the way of the two Florida Republicans aiming for the Oval Office in 2016.In an interview this week with Politico, Rubio said that the strong possibility that Bush, who has been a mentor and supporter of the Cuban-American lawmaker, may run in the next presidential election would not be a deterrent for him from seeking the nation’s highest office.“In terms of my decision-making for next year, it will be based on me – not on anybody else,” Rubio said. “And I think that’s true for anyone thinking about it – including himself.”“It’s not that unusual to see people who have been allies in the past end up running for an office like that.”But for Rubio and Bush, it would be a marked deviation from their protocol with each other, Politico said.Over the years in Florida, Rubio would see if Bush intended to run for office – such as the U.S. Senate after Mel Martinez, a fellow Republican, said he would not seek re-election – before throwing his hat in the ring for a political post.In the case of the Senate seat, Politico said, Bush told Rubio in a phone call that he was not going to pursue it and encouraged him to do so.Rubio often turned to Bush for guidance throughout his political career.Rubio has not said whether he intends to run, but he has been taking high-profile hawkish positions on foreign policy matters regarding Ukraine, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela – moves that many observers say is meant to give him a presidential halo, so to speak.Bush, too, also has not said whether he’ll run.A few days ago, he made headlines when he said in a speech that undocumented immigrants should not be treated as felons because they cross the border largely as an “act of love.”That led to a bit of a backlash by conservatives such as U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican, who accused Bush of pandering.“I think comments from Jeb Bush and other Republicans – what they’re doing is they’re pandering to a certain group of people,” said Labrador, according to The Washington Times.“And I’ve got news for you. If we pass immigration reform tomorrow like members of the Republican conference want us to do, they’re not going to vote for the Republican Party.”Rubio came under fire from conservative members of the GOP last year when he played a pivotal role in a bipartisan Senate immigration measure that passed in June. That bill called for tightening border security, expanding foreign worker visas and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.Conservatives assailed Rubio for endorsing a plan that they said rewards lawbreakers. The effort stalled in the House, where Republicans have a majority, and where conservatives vowed not to allow any measure that included amnesty to move forward.But earlier this week, Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said that while Republicans publicly say they will not pass comprehensive immigration reform with President Barack Obama in the White House – because they don't trust him to implement enforcement parts of a measure like that of the Senate – he believes they privately want it to happen.Schumer said Republicans realize that they must not block immigration reform if they want a real shot at winning back the White House in 2016. Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sen. Schumer Calls Out GOP: Pass Immigration Reform Now To Go Into Effect After Obama Leaves Office WASHINGTON (AP) –  Sen. Chuck Schumer says he has an easy fix to the GOP's latest doubts about overhauling the nation's immigration laws.Pass legislation this year, but don't let the law go into effect until after President Barack Obama's second term ends.The New York Democrat offered his idea Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press in response to House Speaker John Boehner. The Ohio Republican recently cast doubts on the prospects for an immigration overhaul this year, saying President Barack Obama can't be trusted to implement the law.“There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws, and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," Boehner said Thursday, after months of saying he wanted to move ahead with reform and releasing a set of principles in late January outlining such a bill.”Schumer said he believes that Boehner's rap against Obama is false. He said Obama has deported more immigrants living illegally in the U.S. than any other president, but it would be easy enough to pass the law this year to start in 2017.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sen. Schumer Says Republicans Want Immigration Reform â But Don't Want To Vote On It U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat who was part of bipartisan group that drafted a comprehensive immigration reform bill last year, says that Republicans really would like to see such a measure pass in Congress, though individually they donât want to vote on it.The Senate bill, a sweeping measure that includes tightening border security, expanding foreign worker visas, and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who pass a strict set of criteria, passed in June.But the effort stalled when the issue moved to the House of Representatives, where a group of mostly conservative Republicans, who hold the majority, vowed not to approve any measure that allowed undocumented immigrants to legalize their status. They said it would be tantamount to rewarding lawbreakers.In an interview on Monday with MSNBC, Schumer, who is from New York, said: âMost people are for immigration reform. Most Republicans, theyâre in the vote-no, pray-yes caucus, they want it to pass as long as they donât have to vote for it. I still think we have a chance to pass it this year.âSchumer said that other Republicans in the House support comprehensive immigration reform, and that he remains confident that a bill will move forward this year.He speculated that the summer, when Tea Party primaries will have ended, is when immigration reform stands the best chance of gaining traction in Congress.Schumer said many Republicans realize they need to move a reform bill forward to avoid being blamed at election time as the reason that nothing was done about the flawed immigration system.âThe leadership of the caucus realizes one thing, they wonât do it in 2015, because you have the Republican primaries pulling to the right,â Schumer said on MSNBC. âAnd [not doing it] most certainly means theyâre going to lose in 2016.âSchumer said that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, are examples of GOP members who are open to overhauling immigration laws in such a way that tightens enforcement but also provides a path to legal status.On Sunday, Bush, a prospective 2016 presidential candidate, said in an interview with Fox News Channel that those who come into the country illegally generally do so because they had no other means to provide for their family, and what they did is "not a felony.""It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family," Bush said. "I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families."Schumer said about Bush: âHeâs showing where people are atâ¦Jeb Bush represents the more positive wing of the Republican Partyâ¦We have a good chance of passing it this year. Speaker Boehner wants to do it."Earlier this year, Boehner unveiled a non-binding set of immigration "principles" that, among other things, calls for allowing people who are in the United States unlawfully to legalize their status. But later Boehner seemed to back away from the document, saying that many Republicans were reluctant to pass comprehensive immigration reform because they do not trust President Barack Obama to enforce immigration laws.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sheriff Joe Arpaio Called Before Federal Judge For 'Trivializing' Racial Profiling Finding PHOENIX (AP) –  Controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio and a top aide are required to appear before a federal judge who believes the two have mischaracterized and trivialized the judge's key findings in a racial-profiling decision issued last year against the police agency in Maricopa County, Arizona.The sheriff's office will be required to provide answers Monday to U.S. District Judge Murray Snow about an Oct. 18 training session in which the judge said Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan appears to suggest that rank-and-file deputies weren't obliged to make their best efforts to remedy the agency's constitutional violations.Ten months ago, Snow concluded Arpaio's office has systematically racially profiled Latinos in its immigration and regular traffic patrols and unreasonably prolonged the detentions of people during traffic stops. Arpaio has vigorously denied the racial-profiling allegations and has appealed the ruling.The judge has required Arpaio's office to install video cameras in hundreds of the agency's patrol vehicles, set up a seven-person team of sheriff's employees to help implement the judge's orders and carry out additional training to ensure officers aren't making unconstitutional arrests.A video of the October training session shows Sheridan providing a misleading summary of the case to deputies and complaining that the judge was putting the sheriff's office under the same restraints as a judge did to the long-troubled New Orleans Police Department, Snow wrote. "And their police officers were murdering people," Sheridan said. "That tells you how ludicrous this crap is."Arpaio's top aide also talked to deputies about the judge's requirement that officers document the race, ethnicity and sex of people in vehicles based on the officers' perceptions.Sheridan said there might be reasons someone might not be able to figure out the racial identity of those inside the car and offered reasons why they might find it impractical, according to the ruling. "In doing so, it appears to the court that he was suggesting to the deputies that they were not obliged to use their best reasonable efforts to comply with the court's order," Snow wrote.Once Sheridan completed his remarks, Arpaio addressed the deputies, saying Sheridan's thoughts echoed his own. "What the chief deputy said is what I've been saying," Arpaio said.If the police agency maintains that Sheridan's summary of the findings met Snow's orders, Arpaio's office will be required to explain why it believes it's in compliance, Snow wrote."There has got to be a very clear, formal retraction, correction and retraining on all those points," said Cecillia Wang, a lawyer who pressed the profiling case on behalf of a group of Latinos.At a news conference last week, Arpaio repeatedly declined to comment on the judge's rebuke, suggesting that reporters turn to his appeal of the racial-profiling ruling for answers about whether he and Sheridan were undermining Snow's efforts."I am not going to comment until we see what they say in court," Arpaio told reporters. "This is not a court of law."The brief that Arpaio's lawyers filed before an appeals court makes no mention of the October training session.In the appeal, the sheriff's lawyers say Snow's injunction in the case was overly broad and that the judge's requirement that Arpaio's office hold community meetings in an effort to rebuild public confidence runs afoul of the sheriff's free-speech rights.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Sheriff Joe Arpaio Intervenes On Behalf Of Pitbull Who Mauled Latino Toddler PHOENIX (AP) –  Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is thrusting himself into the case of the dog who mauled a 4-year-old boy earlier this year. A Phoenix judge who spared the life of the pit bull — named Mickey — was expected to decide Tuesday where the animal will spend the rest of its life.Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffin had declared Mickey vicious at a hearing a month ago but declined to have him euthanized after animal-rights advocates came to its defense. Instead, she ordered him to be neutered and defanged and gave the Lexus Project, a New York-based animal-rights group and the dog's trustee, 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take him.Now, Sheriff Arpaio has offered to house the dog at a no-kill shelter operated by his office. The sheriff, who is known nationally for his tough stance on immigration and whose office regularly investigates animal abuse cases, is expected to testify at Tuesday's hearing.Attorney John Schill, a lawyer who argued on behalf of the dog, said putting Mickey in the sheriff's shelter for the rest of his life is an acceptable option. The trust will pick up the costs of caring for the dog, he said.The Feb. 20 attack left 4-year-old Kevin Vicente with a broken eye socket and jaw, and the boy has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him.The case touched off a polarizing Internet debate on mercy, blame and animal violence, leading to candlelight vigils and riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. Donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for Kevin since the dog bit the boy in the face.A woman who says her dog was previously killed by Mickey filed a vicious-dog court petition that started the court case.Animal advocates say both the dog and boy are victims and a baby sitter watching the child was negligent in letting him play near the animal. They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Shocking Many Americans, Most Mexicans Have No Clue Who Cesar Chavez Is MEXICO CITY (AP) –  The title in Spanish of the new biopic movie about Cesar Chavez sums up just how little known the Mexican-American labor leader is in Mexico.The movie that opened Thursday, Labor Day in Latin America, is called "The Mexican who defied the United States," with a subtitle that translates as "Who the hell is Cesar Chavez?"That Chavez is barely known in Mexico shocks most Americans. That he was a U.S. civil rights hero with streets, schools, parks and a day in his honor surprises many Mexicans. Most of the moviegoers interviewed before an afternoon showing of film in Mexico City said they only knew about Chavez because of Mexican actor Diego Luna, who directed "Chavez" as his first English-language film."I only know he was an activist and I know it because I read about the movie," said Pedro Penaloza, 48, a sports coach.The movie's producer, Pablo Cruz, said it was tricky coming up with a marketing strategy to draw a Mexican audience and admitted that license was taken with the title to do so. Chavez wasn't a Mexican citizen. He was born in Yuma, Arizona.Cruz said at a Mexico City screening last week that the distributor Videocine came up with the idea of the Mexican who defied the U.S. "That's something that's very inherited somehow, the revenge system, even just in soccer or whatever," he said.The movie, starring Mexican-American actor Michael Pena, portrays Chavez from his early organizing in the fields to his hunger strike, the grape boycott and eventual victory in getting growers to negotiate with farmworkers for better wages and working conditions. He died in California in 1993 at age 66.Luna said he wanted to make the film because it's a shared history that people on both sides fail to recognize. Moviegoers at Mexico City's upscale Antara shopping center, where the screening occurred, are unfamiliar with the issues laborers face in U.S. fields. Mexican-Americans don't realize how much Mexico has changed."Michael Pena, when he first came to Sonora, he said, 'How strange. The most Mexican person here is me.' And he's from Chicago," Luna said. "He was thinking of the Mexico of his father in Purificacion, a small town in Jalisco ... and the world we're sitting in has nothing to do with the world he thought of as his father's.""We can't allow that distance to exist ... like you see in the movie, we're much stronger as a united force."The movie's creators also know they have an uphill battle in selling a movie that portrays any union as a savior of exploited workers in a country where unions are generally considered corrupt. It also doesn't help that the movie had such low box office receipts in the United States after lukewarm reviews.The film cost $15 million to make, but has made under $6 million so far since opening March 28 in the United States.But early moviegoers had positive reviews."It's a really good movie," said homemaker Julieta Cabrera, 66. "I wish there were a man like him in Mexico right now because we're in the same bad situation. We need people as courageous as him to change things."Dolores Huerta, co-organizer of the group that became the United Farm Workers of America, and who is played in the movie by Rosario Dawson, joked that people in Mexico think of the boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez, when they hear labor leader's name."In those days when we were organizing we didn't have the social media as we do right now, there wasn't as much interchange," she said at last week's screening in Mexico City, though she noted that Chavez received the Order of the Aztec Eagle, Mexico's highest honor given to a foreigner."The whole fight for immigration reform will bring us together," she said. "Everybody is very conscious there and here."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 

The silver lining in the Donald Sterling, NBA saga  Stop the presses. Charles Krauthammer and I agree on something.On Monday night’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,” Charles and I were discussing the firestorm over the racist comments made by Donald Sterling, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTKrauthammer made an excellent point.“I think it's a generational thing,” said Charles. “He [Sterling] is 80. [Cliven] Bundy is 67. Paula Deen, slightly more benign, also 67. I think hopefully this attitude is going to die over time, not entirely, but largely, and that's a good thing.”Krauthammer added that President Obama’s response to the controversy has been “exactly right,” in saying that even though instances of bigotry continue to emerge the nation has made great progress.Charles, President Obama and I are all on the same page here.Racial attitudes are close linked to a person’s age.Older Americans are less likely to have gone to school with people off different races. They are less likely to have been on the playground with them, been teammates, loved, hated and admired as well as despised people of other races without tying it exclusively to the other person’s race.Older Americans are more likely to be uncomfortable when they are not in the racial majority at work, a restaurant or the doctor’s office. They don’t know people with a different racial, ethnic identity in their daily lives – in their communities, in their work, in their social settings and in their churches.It is in these human interactions that people move away from stereotypes and assumptions about the other race. They learn they are not all that different from them and that old prejudices are erroneous, hateful and hurtful. They recoil from them.Remember that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who would now be 85, said that in his experience as a young man the most segregated hour of the week is 11:00am on Sundays, when whites and blacks go to separate churches. Given that seniors dominate church attendance in this country that is most often still the case.As such, it is much easier for racial stereotypes and prejudices to take root in the minds of older Americans.Polls show that older Americans are the least comfortable of any age cohort with interracial marriage. They are also uncomfortable with gay marriage. They are the strongest opponents of immigration reform and any phone system that allows people to push #2 to hear the instructions in Spanish.LA Clippers Coach Doc Rivers spoke for a younger generation of Americans when he said Tuesday: "These last 48 hours or more have been really hard for our players and for everyone," Rivers said."I would just like to reiterate how disappointed I am in the comments attributed to our owner, and I can't tell you how upset I am and our players are… When you're around all these people, you realize they are just as upset and embarrassed, and it doesn't reflect who they really are.”The NBA has now banned Donald Sterling from their league. Some older people are no doubt worried that they can’t even admit to their feelings privately without fear of being embarrassed.But the inescapable reality that Charles and I agree on is that the Donald Sterlings of the world are dying off and in the not-too-distant future their racist views will die off with them.It is only a matter of time before these repugnant views slide farther and farther out of the mainstream. They may not ever disappear but they are already not acceptable to the vast majority of Americans.On Bill O’Reilly’s show Monday night Bernie Goldberg said it thrilled him that there was such widespread condemnation of Sterling. He said that is evidence of real racial progress.Bernie, Bill, Charles and I are not spring chickens. But we are all crowing with pride at the nation’s clear response to hateful words.Juan Williams joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 as a contributor and is also a co-host of FNC's "The Five," where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

Sneaking through? Conflicting reports on ‘secret’ immigration plan April 29, 2014: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, joined by Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., talks to reporters following a Republican strategy meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington.APHouse Speaker John Boehner reportedly insisted Tuesday there is no “conspiracy” to push an immigration bill through the House – but a top Democrat suggested not only is there a deal in the works, it’s an open secret.The conflicting messages further blurred the status of immigration talks on Capitol Hill.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBoehner just two months ago appeared to slam the brakes on negotiations altogether, blaming the administration’s failure to enforce existing immigration laws. But GOP leaders, including Boehner, have signaled lately they’re at least interested in bringing back a bill. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, at an immigration event Monday in New York, went further and seemed to claim a bill is in the works.The New York Daily News reported that Schumer, a staunch advocate of legislation that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, said Monday at an immigration event: “I want to let you in on a little secret. We are going to pass that bill and sign it into law this year.”Schumer predicted an immigration bill, even if not the same one passed by the Senate, will hit the House floor.Schumer’s not the only one feeling bullish on immigration legislation.Last week, the No. 4 House Republican, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., also said “there is a path that we get a bill on the floor by August,” according to The Spokesman-Review newspaper.This comes after Boehner reportedly said he was “hell-bent” on getting a bill through this year.The comments and assurances come amid speculation that GOP leaders are keen to advance a bill, in part because the window may be closing to act on immigration and in part because doing so may help the party with Latino voters.The Hill reported that Boehner also told lawmakers during a private GOP meeting Tuesday that there was no “secret conspiracy” to pass an immigration bill.Boehner, addressing the issue at a GOP leadership press conference later Tuesday, tried to clarify the mixed messages. He kept the door open to immigration legislation but reiterated that the biggest obstacle continues to be that the American people and Congress don’t trust President Obama to enforce the law “we may or may not pass.”“We continue to work with our members,” Boehner said, adding that Obama needs to take action to address the trust deficit.Meanwhile, Boehner downplayed remarks he made last week to a local Rotary Club in Ohio where he appeared to make fun of GOP members who don’t want to deal with immigration."Here's the attitude. 'Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard'," Boehner said, pretending to whine.“There was no mocking,” Boehner said Tuesday. “You all know me. You tease the ones you love.”Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
'Dreamers' Pushing Immigration Reform Stalk Speaker Boehner, Target Him At Home About 200 immigrant rights advocates went to House Speaker John Boehnerâs home in the capital on Wednesday morning to press for immigration reform.The immigrants, who have been participating in a fast since Nov. 12 on the National Mall for changes in immigration laws, held a vigil to, in their words, press Boehner to move the reform effort forward in the House, where it has stalled.The website ThinkProgress.org reported that a neighbor of Boehner, who was said to be inside his home at the time, and was seen at one point looking at the crowd through a window, told the protesters to leave. In all they stayed approximately one hour.They refused, reportedly telling the neighbor that many families have been separated because flawed immigration laws have resulted in millions of deportations. âWe want to highlight that every day [Boehner] waits, another 1,100 people are getting deported,â David Chung, another undocumented activist, said, according to the website. âWe knew that he could hear us, we had speakers â¦ we want to schedule a meeting about what we want done on our end â¦ Every day we live this. Itâs a personal fight and we canât give up. Itâs a fight as long as our family members and friends need us. Thereâs still nine days â nine chances for Congress to act.âUnited We Dream, an organization that pushes for more flexible immigration laws, was a key organizer of the vigil.The vigil by the immigrants, who included a large number of Dreamers, according to press reports, was the latest in a series of increasingly provocative moves by activists that have included holding sit-ins in congressional offices and cornering members of Congress in restaurants and events at which they are featured speakers.In recent days, two teenage Dreamers â the name given to undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as minors â surprised Boehner while he had breakfast alone at the counter of a Washington D.C. eatery and said it was important that he get behind immigration reform.Later that same day, however, Boehner said that comprehensive immigration reform would not come up for a vote in the House for the remainder of this year.On Wednesday, almost a dozen Dreamers went to protest at the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia.Earlier in the fall, United We Dream leaders say they would escalate their activism for immigration reform."Dreamers and our parents are escalating because we wonât stop until we end the pain in our communities,â said Cristina Jimenez, Managing Director of United We Dream. âOur families have suffered so much already. Politicians in Congress and President Obama canât afford to ignore the issue of immigration or let this pain in our communities continue," Jimenez said. "The House GOP must act this year to pass legislation that stops ripping families apart and creates a direct path to citizenship that gives us the chance to fully contribute and be protected from deportation.âFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Soviet-born congressional candidate looks to make history Igor Birman, shown here, is running for Congress in California.Igor BirmanDuring the darkest days of the Cold War, some in Washington feared a Communist infiltration inside the highest reaches of the government. It would have been unimaginable then that a man born and raised in Soviet-era Moscow would mount a strong challenge for a seat in Congress, with a rallying cry of freedom against government. Yet that's exactly what's happening in suburban Sacramento where Moscow-born Igor Birman, 32, is living his American dream and trying to become the first-ever member of Congress born in the Soviet Union. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"As the elites in Washington abandon freedom as the cornerstone of America's public policy, we see all of these academic and acrimonious debates," Birman told Fox News. "To me, though, this matter is personal. Freedom is very personal to me. I've lived in a society where freedom was denied to just about everyone but the elites." Birman, a Republican who until last year worked on Capitol Hill, is in the middle of a heated contest challenging Democratic Rep. Ami Bera. But his critiques of Washington go beyond the incumbent freshman. "You don't have to be a Republican or Democrat to dislike the NSA snooping through your private and intimate records. You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to realize that the most feared agencies in government, like the IRS, should not be harassing ordinary Americans for simply disagreeing. There are a lot of issues that transcend party politics these days." As an immigrant, Birman knows intimately the struggles that come with being new to America and is offering his own plans for reforming the immigration system. "Fix that legal immigration process, and I suspect you'll see illegal immigration drop tremendously," he said. Birman, now a U.S. citizen, is also running during a tense time for relations between Washington and Moscow. On the conflict in Ukraine, Birman said the bellicosity of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he calls a KGB thug, is hardly surprising. "We should realize that the only strength that Putin has is the exporting of natural gas energy." Birman explains that Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas is the cause of its timidity in challenging Putin. The American response, he says, should be to aggressively sell U.S. natural gas on the world market, thereby driving down Russian influence and at the same time promoting domestic economic vitality. At a recent gathering of eager campaign volunteers, Birman profusely thanked  them for their efforts and sprinkled in quotes from Reagan and Churchill. "We don't need a new message," he told them. "It may be that we need new and better messengers." Also helping stuff and stamp envelopes are Birman's parents Alexander and Emily. They were the ones who made the critical decision to leave Moscow in 1994 with Igor and his younger brother Eugene. With a stack of letters in front of her, Emily held no doubt that her son will succeed. "I told him whenever you decide to run for Congress or to be a public servant, people will trust you because you speak from your heart." Birman's path to Congress will not be easy. In June's "top two" primary -- in which candidates of all parties run against each other, and the top two move on to the general -- not only does he take on Bera but also two other more prominent Republicans: former Rep. Doug Ose and 2012 Senate nominee Elizabeth Emken. He has the backing, though, of eight members of Congress including Tom McClintock, whom Birman worked for as chief of staff, and Republican Sens.

Spain takes down immigration-fraud ring Spanish police reported Tuesday that they had busted a network that arranged marriages of convenience for Latin Americans seeking legal residence in Spain.Authorities detained 66 women, 55 of whom are Spanish, nine Colombians, an Ecuadorian and a Dominican.The organization falsified identity documents, passports and driver's licenses, police said in a communique.It also laundered money, sending large sums to Colombia.The women who were arrested range in age from 21 to 68.The operation was begun in November when authorities detected that marriages of convenience were being entered into between Spanish and Colombian citizens in a town in the southeastern province of Alicante.At least 13 fraudulent marriages were made, sources close to the investigation told Efe.Behind the scam was a criminal organization, most of the members of which lived in Alicante but which operated in various Spanish provinces, the press release said.The organization provided complete coverage for the foreigners who were in Spain illegally, from going through all the procedures to arrange the marriages up to obtaining residence permits.

Spain urges international cooperation on immigration Spain is analyzing the measures needed to avoid tragedies like the deaths of 12 sub-Saharans last week when they tried to swim from Moroccan territory to the neighboring Spanish city of Ceuta, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said Friday.The government is also calling for improved coordination on the matter within the European Union and for cooperation with migrants' homelands and the countries they pass through.Soraya Saenz de Santamaria referred to the appearance Thursday in Parliament of Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz to brief lawmakers on the Feb. 6 incident in Ceuta.In what the deputy premier described as an "example of transparency," the minister acknowledged that members of the Spanish Civil Guard fired rubber bullets when some 400 immigrants tried to enter Spanish territory, though he said the defense measure was proportional to the threat.In the heart of the EU there is an attempt to improve coordination of border control and cooperation procedures with immigrants' countries of origin and transit, since they "seem doomed to further tragedies like those that have occurred on a number of occasions," Saenz de Santamaria said.The European Commission, the EU's executive body, asked Spain to explain the shooting of rubber bullets last week in Ceuta.

Opinion: GOP's Little Or Negative News Coverage In Spanish Is Self-Inflicted Wound The organization MRC Latino â part of the conservative-leaning Media Research Center â held an event last week to present a new study that found that coverage in Spanish news programs on Univision and Telemundo skews liberal. In particular, they took issue with the fact that Univision and Telemundo partnered to do a town hall to inform Latinos about the Affordable Care Act and tell the community how to sign up.- Pili TobarIt didnât take long for Senator Marco Rubio to jump on the bandwagon to criticize Telemundo and Univision, he said theyâre âall-out advocates for Obamacare, trying to get people signed upâ¦.and itâs unfortunate.â You would think that Senator Rubio would want Latinos and Hispanics to understand the system, their options, and how to sign up for healthcare.  Apparently thatâs not the case.Univision and Telemundoâs job is to keep the Latino / Hispanic community informed â particularly when it comes to issues that greatly affect them. MRC Latino labeling the networksâ coverage as liberal is another Republican attack towards the Latino community, and an incredibly cynical and inaccurate attempt to discredit the networksâ objectivity.Spanish language networksâ overall coverage reflects the interests of the Hispanic and Latino community. Republicansâ little or negative coverage in Spanish nightly news is a self-inflicted wound that has nothing to do with network bias; it has to do with facts.On the Affordable Care Act, Univision and Telemundo did the responsible thing as media outlets with a particular constituency, and informed their audience - which is greatly affected by the new health law - about how to sign up for the ACA. They helped their Spanish speaking audience sign up for healthcare because they know that Latinos are one of the largest uninsured populations in the United States, and that Obamacare is the law of the land - no matter how many times Republicans vote to repeal or undermine it. Univision and Telemundo did nothing wrong by having a conversation.And donât even get me started on immigration reform. Republicans have quite the nerve criticizing Spanish media networks for their coverage on the issue. Immigration reform is a priority for the Hispanic / Latino community, and the networksâ coverage reflects the reality. How many times have Republicans killed the possibility of passing immigration reform or voted against measures that would advance HR 15 to the House floor?Itâs crystal clear that Republicans are the ones blocking immigration reform from moving forward in the House of Representatives and playing with peoplesâ lives. Republicans have no place to complain about the coverage theyâre receiving from Spanish language networks when theyâre standing in the way of a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in this country, many of whom are of Latino / Hispanic descent, and rely on Univision and Telemundo as their trusted news networks. The networks are simply reporting what issues are impacting the communities of their audience.Just this past week, in the House Budget Committeeâs markup of the Ryan budget, Republicans on the committee unanimously voted against an amendment to create the economic infrastructure to support comprehensive immigration reform. They also voted unanimously against raising the minimum wage â 25 percent of those affected by a minimum wage hike are Hispanic â and they have failed to extend long-term unemployment insurance.All of this on top of Congressmen Steve King and Mo Brooksâ latest offensive comments towards military DREAMers. Steve King thinks these DREAMers should be deported, while Mo Brooks said that they have âquestionable loyalties.âUnivision and Telemundo have done their job reporting the facts. If Republicans want more positive coverage, they should change their policies to ones that will benefit the Latino / Hispanic community. They should change their rhetoric, and stop blocking immigration reform. Pointing fingers while attempting to discredit Spanish language networksâ objectivity and whining about the coverage you receive is unproductive and just another attempt to manipulate and deceive the community.Republicans believe reaching out to Latinos means putting Hispanic organizers on the ground, while continuing to insult the community with their words and their actions â and now apparently insulting Latino media as well. And they wonder why their coverage falls short?Pili Tobar is Director of Hispanic Media at Democratic National Committee.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Boehner Apologizes To House Republicans For Teasing Them About Immigration Reform John Boehner doesn’t mock.Well, maybe just a little. And lovingly.At a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans Tuesday morning, the Speaker apologized for comments he made over the recess at an Ohio Rotary Club, apparently mocking politicians for stalling on working on an overhaul of the immigration system."Here's the attitude,” Boehner said last week before affecting a high-pitched tone, “'Oh, don't make me do this. Oh, this is too hard,'" he went on. He added that some of his colleagues in Congress would prefer to ignore that, "We get elected to solve problems."According to Roll Call, during the session with his fellow Republicans, the Speaker also assured colleagues that he has no interest in pushing immigration reform over their objections.After the meeting, Boehner spoke to reporters, and he appeared to back down from the pugnacious stance he took at the Rotary Club."You tease the ones you love, right?" Boehner told reporters. "But some people misunderstood what I had to say. I can rib people just a little too much sometimes. This wouldn't be the first time."“I wanted to make sure the members understood the biggest impediment we have to moving immigration reform is that the America people don’t trust the president to enforce or implement the law that we may or may not pass,” he said, according to the website Politico.Asked if there would be a vote on immigration reform, Boehner answered, “We all know we have a broken immigration system. We’re going to continue to work with our members and have discussions to see if there’s a way forward.”Some conservatives took offense at Boehner's comments, saying the Speaker should be keeping the focus on Barack Obama. Some Republicans say it's largely the president's fault that comprehensive immigration legislation, including border security and eventual citizenship for millions, remains stalled in the House 10 months after Senate passage. They say they can't trust Obama because of his record of taking steps by executive action.Democrats, meanwhile, saw signs of renewed hope for immigration legislation in Boehner's comments blaming the House GOP, though Boehner's aides downplayed any such suggestion.Asked Tuesday about Boehner's remarks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said, "I'm glad he's complaining about his members for a change so I don't have to."Because of the dim prospects on Capitol Hill, Obama has come under extraordinary pressure to act on his own to stem deportations and address the 11.5 million people in the country illegally. The administration is weighing curbing deportations of people here illegally who have little or no criminal record, but timing on any such steps is uncertain.Administration officials appear to want to give Boehner time and space to exhaust the possibility of congressional action before moving forward on their own.After the closed-door meeting on Tuesday, Politico spoke to a couple of the other House Republicans present at the meeting and found little rancor toward Boehner over the comments.“He was really just, I think, trying to get ahead of any criticism,” Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) said. “I do think some members were offended by that, and I think he was trying to put it in proportion in saying that it was not as serious as maybe it seemed to be.”“People say all kinds of things,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) when asked for his reaction to Boehner’s remarks. “No big deal.”The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Speaker John Boehner Closes Window On Immigration Reform This Year Speaker John Boehner dashed hopes on Wednesday for quick action on immigration reform, at least for the remainder of this year.Boehner said the House will not hold formal compromise talks on the comprehensive immigration bill that was passed by the Senate in June, a fresh signal from the Republican leadership that the issue is dead for the year.Boehner, R-Ohio, insisted that the House is focused on a piecemeal approach, but he declined to say whether lawmakers will consider any legislation this year or whether the issue will slip entirely to 2014.The No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, had told immigration advocates last week that the House won't vote this year."The idea that we're going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House and frankly I'll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill," Boehner told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference.He said Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is working on "a set of principles to help guide us as we deal with this issue."The Senate bill would tighten border security and provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.The House Judiciary Committee has approved smaller bills, but they have languished since the summer despite intense pressure from religious groups, business, labor and immigration advocates.Although House GOP leaders say they want to resolve the issue, many rank-and-file Republicans have shown little inclination to deal with immigration.The bitter standoff with President Barack Obama on the budget further angered House Republicans, who have resisted administration moves to overhaul immigration, the top item on President Obama's second-term domestic agenda.Before Boehner's news conference, several immigrant children approached the speaker as he sat down for breakfast at a Capitol Hill diner and described how they could lose parents to deportation. The children were in Washington as several organizations maintain their pressure on the House to act on immigration.Carmen Lima, a 13-year-old from California, told Boehner that she feared never she would never see her father again and asked if the group could count on his vote."Well, I'm trying to find some way to get this thing done," Boehner said. "It's ... not easy — not gonna be an easy path forward. But I've made it clear since the day after the election that it's time to get this done."Democrats expressed frustration over the House's lack of action at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on how to enforce laws to deal with legal immigrants who overstay their visas."If we can vote 45 times to gut Obamacare and have another vote scheduled this week, why can the Republican leadership not find the time to schedule one vote on immigration?" asked Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, D-Ill. "They say that where there is a will, there is a way, and I think there is time to get something done, but I don't believe the Republican Party has the will to do it."Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was part of the bipartisan group that worked on the Senate's immigration bill, criticized Boehner's statement.“Speaker Boehner’s comments are insulting to the majority of Americans who want to see comprehensive immigration reform," he said in a statement. "It has been over six months since Democrats and Republicans in the Senate joined forces, negotiated and passed an immigration bill that was approved by a supermajority. The House of Representatives has irresponsibly voted over 45 times to defund the Affordable Care Act, yet Speaker Boehner now claims there is no time for one single vote on common-sense immigration reform."The Associated Press contributed to this story. 
Spring migration offensive: Africans risk lives to reach Spanish enclaves, other hot spots In this photo taken on Friday March 28, 2014, Sub-Saharan migrants react on top of a metallic fence that divides Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla.

Here immigration has become an Olympic event. (AP Photo/Santi Palacios)The Associated PressMELILLA, Spain –  They perched atop a barbed-wire laced fence for more than seven hours, hands and feet bloodied, buffeted by chill winds whipping the epic cliffs of Africa's Mediterranean coast.The 27 sub-Saharan African migrants were literally on the edge between Africa's economic misery and the long-dreamt riches of Europe: On one side of the fence was Morocco, on the other the Spanish enclave of Melilla.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThirst, hunger and exhaustion wore the migrants down. One by one, they shakily climbed down the ladder that Spanish authorities had propped up on their side of the fence. Spanish police led the Africans back to Morocco — and into the hands of their waiting Moroccan counterparts.The men are part of a spring migration offensive from Africa to Europe, with record numbers of desperate people risking death in their quest for a better life. They use perilous routes such as sea-crossings on rickety boats to the Italian island of Lampedusa or treks through desert, jungle and mountain that culminate in attempts to scale fences erected to keep them out of Melilla and Spain's other North African enclave, Ceuta.Official data for 2013 is not yet available from Spain — but already in the first three months of this year, the number of migrants making it into Melilla has surpassed the estimated 1,000 who made it last year. On March 18 alone, a record 500 made it over while weeks before the Moroccans blocked another 700 — numbers unheard of in the past. The increasing pressure of African immigration is felt across Europe, with the U.N. reporting a 300 percent rise in migrants this spring attempting boat crossings to Lampedusa compared to the same period the previous year.For the Melilla migrants, most of whom spent at least two years traveling from their destitute homes in central and west Africa to get here, the climb-down will be a temporary setback. In weeks, they will likely be back, trying once more to enter Europe. Dozens are wounded with every attempt. There are often fatalities, including 15 who drowned in waters outside Ceuta on Feb. 6 after Spanish guards fired at them with rubber bullets.Spain's Supreme Court banned the use of rubber bullets after the drowning deaths caused an outcry. That may have just emboldened the migrants. "They feel less threatened," said Anke Strauss of the International Organization for Migration.Melilla and Ceuta offer the only land route between the world's richest and poorest continents. Nearly every week, hundreds of migrants sneak down from mountain camps to throw themselves at Moroccan police and try to clamber over three layers of fences, using poles to pull down the rolls of barbed wire and boosting themselves over each other's bodies."As long as there is such a big difference in wealth and there are problems in Africa, there will always be immigration," said Adil Akkid of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, which works with the migrants camped around the Moroccan city of Nador, outside Melilla. "Europe is the richest and closest continent."Along the Spanish enclaves, the rise is partly due to success by Morocco and Spain in discouraging sea routes between the two countries. In February, Morocco announced that it had reduced illegal immigration to Spain using boats by 93 percent.Spain has sounded a cry of alarm on illegal migration, with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy asking last week for "greater commitment" to deal with the pressure on Ceuta and Melilla. Moroccan and Spanish authorities have estimated that there are no less than 30,000 illegal immigrants in Morocco — most hoping to get into Europe.Under such pressure, the countries are resorting to increasingly brutal tactics, human rights groups warn. In February, Human Rights Watch slammed the countries' security forces for beating migrants, as well as expelling those who had made it over the fence without considering asylum claims.Rough treatment doesn't deter the migrants.While African migrants shuffling along on crutches with broken legs from failed attempts can be seen in the streets of Nador, there are many more waiting to try.Mount Gourougou looms over Nador and Melilla, and its wooded, often fog-shrouded slopes are home to thousands of African migrants. They live in makeshift camps as they prepare to creep through the night for dawn assaults on the fences.For all of them, it is the final stage of a years-long journey through treacherous terrain."I don't even know how long ago I left home," said a young tired-looking Senegalese man carrying empty plastic bottles up the mountain after a day of scavenging for food in nearby Moroccan villages."When I think of the place I left behind, I can't go home — to go back empty-handed after all this? Not possible."His companions, including a 16-year-old youth from Cameroon, nodded before trudging up cactus-laden slopes as a light rain began to fall. None gave their names for fear it would harm their chances of getting to Spain.The sound of sirens and men shouting erupted in the distance. Migrants said it was the racket of Moroccan police forces carrying out a daily comb of the mountain to flush out migrants.Despite the police efforts, several hundred migrants clambered down for an assault later that night. Of those, 27 ended up stranded on the fence the next morning, while their rest were repulsed."We only have five minutes to cross the wire because then security calls for reinforcements — and if we get across before they come, we can make it," said Aba, a muscular young man from Cameroon outside the temporary camp for refugees in Melilla.In contrast to the grim expressions of those on the mountain, the migrants at the Melilla camp are quick to smile — for they are now in Europe.After a few months wait, they will be transported to mainland Spain where they will either be processed for repatriation — a difficult process if they lack documents and lie about their nationality — or more likely eventually turned loose."Nothing in the world is as hard as that fence and there is always a loss of life," said Jackie Mefire, an aspiring rapper from the Central African Republic, who was kicked back to Morocco three times before finally reaching Melilla.Behind him, affluent Spaniards could be seen putting on the nearby Melilla golf course.____Associated Press writers Harold Heckle and Ciaran Giles contributed to this report from Madrid. 
Spurning Sen. Rubio, Rep. Ros-Lehtinen Says She Would Support Jeb Bush For President If Jeb Bush runs for president in 2016, he can count on the firm support of another prominent Florida Republican – Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.In fact, Ros-Lehtinen has essentially endorsed the former Florida governor for president, even though her former intern and ally in Congress on many issues – Sen. Marco Rubio – also is seen as a likely 2016 presidential candidate.In an interview with The Hill, Ros-Lehtinen pledged her support for Bush if he enters the GOP presidential primary."I'm with him,” she said in no uncertain terms.Both Bush and Rubio have not yet announced whether they’re running for president in 2016.Ros-Lehtinen often sides with Rubio on a wide range of issues, including foreign policy, on which they prefer a tough U.S. approach toward the governments of Cuba, Venezuela, Iran and Russia. Both are Cuban-American and come from south Florida.She told The Hill that Rubio probably would not run if Bush decided to pursue the White House.Rubio, however, recently said that he would not decide against running in 2016 just because Bush – who has been something of a mentor to him – decides to throw his hat into the ring.“In terms of my decision-making for next year, it will be based on me – not on anybody else,” Rubio said in an interview when asked about the prospects of a Bush candidacy. “And I think that’s true for anyone thinking about it – including himself.”Both Rubio and Bush have taken hits from conservatives, mainly over their stances regarding undocumented immigrants.Bush sparked controversy this week in an interview when he described illegal immigration as an "act of love" by people trying to provide for their families.Rubio's public participation in last year’s bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill – he essentially became the face of the effort to gain national support for the measure – ultimately made him a target for Tea Party members and other conservatives upset over his embrace for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Some Republicans have defended both men, saying that their views are not at cross-purposes with conservative values, and that Bush and Rubio are taking the pragmatic view that the U.S. cannot round up and deport all undocumented immigrants.But others saw their words and actions as a betrayal of conservative values, and questioned whether someone who supports giving what they called amnesty to lawbreakers could truly be a conservative."Maybe some folks don't think that [Bush is] as conservative as he should be,” Ros-Lehtinen said to The Hill, “but he's a very pragmatic conservative and compassionate man as well.”House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has indicated his support for a Bush candidacy.During an appearance on "The Tonight Show," Boehner said Bush would be a "great president."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Supreme Court Considering To Take Up Part Of Arizona's Controversial Immigration Law PHOENIX (AP) –  The U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether to take up, once again, a piece of Arizona's immigration law.Gov. Jan Brewer asked the court to review a ruling that blocked law enforcement from arresting people for harboring people living in the U.S. illegally. In October, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found the harboring ban was vague and trumped by federal law, which already prohibits the harboring of people who aren't in the country legally.The ban was in effect for a two-year period ending in September 2012. Two weeks before shelving the harboring ban, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said no arrests had been made under that section of the law.Immigrant rights advocates challenging the 2010 law told the nation's highest court that none of the country's federal appeals courts have upheld a similar state law.Brewer's attorneys contend the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision was flawed because a state can make a federal violation of law a state crime.The state's harboring ban has been overshadowed by other parts of the law, including a requirement that police officers, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of those suspected of being in the country illegally.The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the questioning requirement but struck down other sections of the law, such as a requirement that all immigrants carry immigration registration papers. The nation's highest court hasn't yet accepted an appeal over the harboring ban.It's unclear when the court will decide whether to hear Brewer's latest appeal.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Supreme Court Rejects AZ's Appeal Seeking To Punish People Who Harbor Undocumented Immigrants The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, at the request of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, over a part of Arizona’s immigration law that would call on police to arrest people who harbor undocumented immigrants.The justices had no comment Monday on their order declining to review a ruling that blocked enforcement of that part of Arizona's 2010 immigration law.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found last year that the harboring ban was vague and trumped by federal law, which already prohibits the harboring of people who aren't in the country legally.The harboring ban was in effect from late July 2010 until a federal judge in Phoenix blocked its enforcement in Sept. 2012 as part of a challenge by civil rights groups.Immigrant rights advocates challenging the 2010 law told the nation's highest court that none of the country's federal appeals courts have upheld a similar state law.Brewer's attorneys had argued that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision was flawed because a state can make a federal violation of law a state crime.The state's harboring ban was overshadowed by other parts of the law, including a requirement that police officers, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of those suspected of being in the country illegally.In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the questioning requirement but struck down other sections of the law, such as a requirement that all immigrants carry immigration registration papers.Known as the "show me your papers" provision, it requires state and local police to perform roadside immigration checks if a "reasonable suspicion" exists that someone is in the country illegally.In pushing for the right to enforce its own immigration laws, Arizona state officials said that the federal government had failed in its responsibility to secure the borders and control illegal immigration, and that states – particularly those on the border – were forced to deal with the consequences of people living here unlawfully and usurping state resources.An estimated 11 million people live in the United States illegally — most of them are Latinos and roughly half are visa overstays.Arizona's move toward implementing its own immigration law set in motion similar efforts by lawmakers in other states frustrated by illegal immigration.Last month, the Supreme Court declined to hear other cases brought forwarded by officials of towns in Texas and Pennsylvania who want laws that would, for instance, penalize landlords for renting to people who are in the country illegally.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Supreme Court won't let Arizona criminalize "harboring" migrants The U.S. Supreme Court refused Monday to restore a provision of an Arizona law that would criminalize the "harboring and transportation" of undocumented immigrants.The justices' decision not to hear the state's appeal leaves intact the ruling adopted in October 2013 by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which established that federal immigration law takes precedence over this provision.The provision in litigation, part of Arizona's controversial SB 1070 immigration law, would criminalize both encouraging the undocumented to enter the state and providing them with transportation or somewhere to stay in Arizona.Several groups sued to have that legislation overturned.Because of those lawsuits, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton temporarily suspended the provision before it took effect.In a 2012 case, the Supreme Court upheld some parts of SB 1070, including the controversial "show me your papers" provision.Defenders of civil rights in Arizona expressed their satisfaction Monday with the Supreme Court's decision."This is another example of how the courts are taking the right decision about this law being unnecessary, because there are already federal laws that cover situations of this kind," Alessandra Soler, executive director of the Arizona ACLU, told Efe in Tucson.The ACLU believes that anyone could be charged with a crime who gives an undocumented person a ride, though it's only to take them to school, church or the doctor.

Swiss voters approve limits on immigration from EU Swiss voters decided in a referendum Sunday to limit the entry of citizens of European Union countries into their labor market by imposing annual quotas.The official results from all the Swiss cantons - with the exception of Zurich, where the voting in one district is still under way, although the results there will not change the final tally - show that 50.4 percent of voters supported the so-called "Against mass migration" initiative.The proposal by the extreme rightist Democratic Union of the Center, or UDC - also known as the Swiss People's Party - reestablishes the principle of preference for Swiss workers over foreigners, a measures that had been abolished for all workers coming from EU nations.The result will force a renegotiation of the bilateral agreement between Switzerland and the EU regarding the free circulation of people, which has been in force since 2002.All political commentators and representatives of the economic media are asking what the reaction of Brussels will be to the vote and the fear is that the EU will decide to renegotiate the full package of agreements that regulate its relations with Switzerland.The consequences for the Swiss economy and the labor market could be very negative, analysts said.During the course of the campaign prior to the referendum, the UDC said that immigration was causing an unsustainable increase in the country's population and creating problems such as rising unemployment, particularly in border regions.The party blamed immigrants for rising real estate prices, the overcrowding on trains, traffic problems and unfair salary competition.About a quarter of the eight million people living in Switzerland are foreigners.

Tea Party House Republican 'Habla' Immigration Reform With Latino Constituents U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney recently told a group of constituents, most of them Latinos, at the First Baptist Church in Gaffney, South Carolina, that he as well as other fellow Republicans favor some opportunity for legal status for undocumented immigrants, but that a lack of trust in President Obama keeps them from moving forward with immigration reform.It is a message that Republicans have been repeating the last few weeks, as advocates of comprehensive immigration reform continue to press for an overhaul of the system and warn that Latinos will remember their inaction when they vote in this year’s elections.But Mulvaney’s comments came with a twist.The Tea Party favorite, known for consistently voting conservatively, held his town hall meeting in Spanish, according to The New York Times.“We are afraid that if we reach an agreement, [Obama] will take the parts he likes and he won’t take the parts that he doesn’t like,” Mulvaney told the crowd.Last June, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill that called for, among other things, boosting the security at the border, expanding foreign work visas and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria. But efforts to reform the system stalled in the House, where a conservative faction of Republicans – who have the majority in that chamber – are firmly opposed to giving a break to undocumented immigrants.Mulvaney’s district is solidly Republican, but like many in his party, his district includes business owners who rely on immigrant labor and want an overhaul of immigration laws that would expand the foreign-born workers who may work in this country.Moreover, the Latino population is growing in South Carolina, as it is in many other part of the region, gradually changing the demographics of political constituencies.“We are not insignificant,” said Victor Prieto, a Southern Baptist minister and university professor, according to the Times.Mulvaney stressed that he does not favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, just a form of legal status, the Times said.  What he meant by legal status, however, is unclear.“I am more than willing to have a discussion about allowing at least part of the 11 million people here illegally to have some type of status,” he said. “I’m just disappointed that more people in my party don’t want to do that.”He, like other Republicans, expressed dismay over Obama’s executive action changes to the health care law, and said the party is concerned that he would do something similar with immigration. Many Republicans have said they do not trust the President not to implement enforcement provisions of any immigration reform legislation.Obama and many Democrats charge that Republicans are grasping for an excuse for why they are not working on a reform bill that would overhaul the system.“If I worry he would selectively enforce the law, it throws a cold shower on the whole immigration discussion,” Mulvaney told the newspaper.Tea Party members, meanwhile, are watching Mulvaney’s moves on immigration reform.“If Mick Mulvaney would come out tomorrow to do immigration reform, somebody from the Tea Party would challenge him,” said Karen Martin, a founder of the Tea Party group in Mulvaney’s district, according to the Times.“Mick Mulvaney is just not going to come out for immigration reform,” she said. “He is not going to push for something people in his district see as a threat.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Ten of America's worst villains, scoundrels and rogues Belle Gunness with her children Philip, Myrtle, and Lucy.Courtesy: La Porte County Historical Society MuseumAmerica has produced an amazing list of illustrious figures over the past three centuries, but we’ve had our share of nefarious characters as well. When I began researching my new book, "Villains, Scoundrels, and Rogues: Incredible True Tales of Mischief and Mayhem (Prometheus Books, March 4, 2014)," I found myself immersed in lurid accounts of seedy serial killers, murdering mobsters, and other horrific psychopaths—the gory fare that seems to be the favorite of “true crime” writers.To be honest, though, focusing on that brutal crowd can be emotionally draining. That’s why I broadened my inquiries to include a more interesting mix of ne’er-do-wells—everyone from spies, con men, and gamblers to fake mediums, counterfeiters, and medical charlatans.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBut people still ask me which of my thirty subjects were the “worst of the worst.” Well, here goes. If these ten characters don’t rank as some of the nastiest people in American history, I don’t know who would. I’ve listed them in chronological order, rather than according to their relative “badness.” I’ll leave that judgment up to readers.1. William Stoughton—Salem’s Rabid Witch-HunterMassachusetts Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton—the homicidal judge who presided over the Salem witch trials of 1692—had no legal training whatsoever. Rigid and prideful, the sixty-year-old bachelor was educated for the ministry but found his calling in colonial politics. When hysteria broke out in Salem after a group of young girls were thought to have been bewitched, Stoughton was assigned to ferret out the offenders. In the wildly unjust trials that followed, he demonstrated the ham-fisted tactics of a grand inquisitor, denying defendants representation, allowing witnesses to introduce gossip and conjecture as evidence, and arbitrarily sending nineteen innocent victims to the gallows, fourteen of them women. Stoughton was later said to have perpetrated “a series of judicial murders that have no parallel in our history.”2. James DeWolf—Merchant of MiseryJames DeWolf was the leading figure in the most active slave-importing family in American history, an elite Rhode Island clan that enjoyed lives of extreme luxury paid for by the suffering of others. From the early 1700s to the early 1800s, dealing in human chattel earned immense fortunes for many prominent Northern families like the DeWolfs, a heritage that’s unfamiliar to most Americans, who generally associate slavery strictly with the South. For nearly a century, tiny Rhode Island was responsible for 60 to 90 percent of America’s slaving voyages, led by the towns of Newport and Bristol. The trade made James DeWolf one of the country’s richest men. DeWolf demonstrated the blackness of his soul in 1790 when he tossed a sick female slave overboard, resulting in an indictment for murder, although the charge was eventually dropped.3. Samuel Mason—The Cutthroat Captain of Cave-In-RockBetween the early 1790s and 1803, pirate and highwayman Samuel Mason conducted a reign of terror along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and Natchez Trace, making life on the frontier even more perilous. From a riverside cave in present-day Illinois, Mason preyed on pioneers traveling down the Ohio. After luring passing vessels ashore, Mason and his gang robbed and murdered the travelers—crimes depicted in the movie "How the West Was Won."Along the Natchez Trace, Mason commemorated his depredations by writing his name in his victims’ blood on a nearby tree. When Mason was caught in 1803, he had 20 human scalps in his possession. He later escaped but was murdered by two of his own men for the reward that had been placed on their leader’s head—a fitting end for a bloodthirsty predator.4. John Chivington—Architect of a TragedyOn November 29, 1864, Col. John Chivington unleashed one of the worst Indian massacres in American history, the slaughter of some 150 Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children, and elderly at Sand Creek, Colorado. Even though the Indians encamped at Sand Creek had surrendered earlier to a U.S. Army representative, Chivington told his men to take no prisoners, and he stood by as unspeakable atrocities were committed. Undisciplined and a relentless self-promoter, Chivington hoped that public acclaim over his “victory” would sweep him into public office, although he was disappointed in that regard.Initially declared a hero, Chivington was later censured by a military investigation and died in disgrace. What made the massacre even more shocking was the fact that Chivington was an ordained minister.5. Belle Gunness—The Killer They Called "Hell’s Belle"At the turn of the twentieth century, Norwegian immigrant Belle Gunness became one of the country’s most notorious lonely hearts killers and our worst female serial killer ever. She’s believed to have slain over 40 people in Chicago and La Porte, Indiana, including her two husbands and all seven of her children, profiting from insurance claims and other scams. Many of her victims were cash-bearing suitors she lured to her farmhouse with promises of marriage, only to drug and murder them. In 1908, she faked her own death by killing her maid and her last three children then burning down her house with their bodies inside. Investigators determined that the adult body was too small to have been that of Gunness, who’d withdrawn her money from local banks days before. No one knows what ever became of this demented creature.6. & 7. Isaac Harris and Max Blanck—Partners in PerfidyOn March 25, 1911, the greed of New York sweatshop owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck resulted in the deaths of 146 workers in the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Harris and Blanck had failed to conduct fire drills or provide adequate safety equipment, and they were so afraid that their seamstresses might pilfer a few scraps of cloth that they locked the door to one of the two stairways leading from their ninth-floor workshop. When an inferno blocked the other stairway, most of their workers either perished in the fire or leapt from the windows to die on the sidewalks below. Although indicted for manslaughter, the two owners escaped punishment. They even made a $60,000 profit from the fire, thanks to over-insuring their factory. After families of the victims filed civil suits, Harris and Blanck paid out a paltry $75 for each life lost.8. Charles Davenport—Keeper of the Immaculate SpermIn the early twentieth century, biologist Charles Davenport sought to create an American master race of Nordic and Anglo-Saxon Protestants through the pseudoscience of eugenics, or selective breeding. Davenport and his followers advocated immigration restrictions for “undesirable” ethnic groups, the prevention of “unfit” marriages, and sterilization of “defective” individuals. By the time eugenics lost favor in the 1940s, between 40,000 and 70,000 Americans had been sterilized against their will, mostly minorities or the poor and uneducated. Davenport’s gravest offense was his support of Nazi scientists in their heinous program of “racial hygiene.” Hitler himself followed the American eugenics movement, and German leaders even cited this country’s eugenic sterilization laws in their defense at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunals.9. John Brinkley—The Consummate Medical HucksterFrom 1917 through the 1930s, physician John Brinkley made millions of dollars by implanting goat testicles in men to restore their virility. Fifty new patients a week traveled to Brinkley’s Milford, Kansas, clinic sixty-five miles west of Topeka, eager to pay $750 for an operation that seems laughably suspect today but which, in the early years of the twentieth century, struck many people as perfectly plausible. The placebo effect often convinced Brinkley’s patients that their potency had been restored. Unfortunately, at least forty-two men died from infections following their operations. The goat gland doctor’s prosperity ended after he sued the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association for libel. In the ensuing trial, Brinkley was exposed as a quack, resulting in the collapse of his practice and bankruptcy.10. Mildred Gillars—The Silken Voice of TreacheryFrom 1942 to 1945, the voice of frustrated actress Mildred Gillars was beamed around the world from war-torn Europe. Dubbed “Axis Sally” by the Allies, Gillars would become one of the most reviled Americans of her time for her anti-Semitic rants as a German propagandist. Her efforts to persuade U.S. soldiers to give up their fight against Adolf Hitler would lead to her trial and conviction for treason after the war. Gillars claimed that she’d done it all because of her love for her boss, saying he’d forced her into becoming a Nazi mouthpiece. The more likely reason was her elevation from abject failure in her own country to artistic success in Germany, where she became the highest paid Nazi broadcaster. In the end, though, Gillars had bargained away her honor for a pittance and paid for her moment of acclaim with lasting infamy.Longtime National Geographic editor Paul Martin is the author of two recent collections of biographical profiles, "Villains, Scoundrels, and Rogues: Incredible True Tales of Mischief and Mayhem" and "Secret Heroes: Everyday Americans Who Shaped Our World."

Texas Democrat Calls GOP Attacks On Migrants Insulting Austin –  State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, the Democrat who is trying to become the first woman and first Hispanic to serve as lieutenant governor of Texas, sees the rhetoric Republicans use to attack clandestine immigration as insulting."It's disheartening to hear the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor use such a harsh rhetoric," she said here in an interview with Efe, referring to comments by the two men vying for the GOP nomination.Incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst faces state Sen. Dan Patrick in a May 27 runoff to decide who will oppose Van de Putte in the November election.Patrick describes clandestine immigration as "invasion" and has made disparaging comments about the region along the Mexican border."The real fact of the matter is that there is zero net migration and that we trade $720 million a day with Mexico," Van de Putte said.Close to 65 percent of the U.S.-Mexican border is in Texas, whose population is 38 percent Hispanic.Van De Putte acknowledges the importance of prosecuting human and drug trafficking, but says the federal government added 8,000 Border Patrol agents in recent years, built 700 miles of border fence and deported tens of thousands of the undocumented who have no criminal records."When Republican candidates refer to a very vibrant area of our state as a third world and as a war zone, people of these communities are insulted. And I am insulted because I am Texan," the San Antonio resident said.Van De Putte expressed disappointment at Washington's inability to pass immigration reform."It's very difficult when the primary goal of the Republicans is to win the next election rather than do what is right," she said. "But I also know that if we had a president and the Congress working together, we can solve this and come to middle ground".In Texas, where many voters look with distrust at federal authorities and only 34 percent approve the administration of President Barack Obama, Democrats make few references to the White House in their political rallies."I am not running for U.S. Congress, I am running for lieutenant governor in the state of Texas," Van de Putte says about the matter.The Democratic candidate for governor of Texas is Wendy Davis and, though these are two separate elections, the leadership of two women for the first time in the history of the state is symbolic.In the primaries, however, Davis got fairly poor support in some Latino-majority counties in south Texas, which her Hispanic colleague attributes to confusion and their unfamiliarity with the candidate."When they get to know her, they will see how great a leader she can be," Van de Putte said.A pharmacist by training, the 59-year-old Van de Putte has been married for 36 years and has six children and six grandchildren.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Texas Lawmaker Is On A Mission To Draw More Latinos To The Republican Party Hispanics will be a majority voting electorate in 15 years in the Lone Star state, and the political party that wins their hearts and minds will win elections, said a Latino freshman state lawmaker.Texas Rep. Jason Villalba, a Republican, is making it his mission to keep his party alive in his home state, and to him that requires getting the GOP to see how Latinos are critical to keeping Texas from going blue.“We’re already a minority-majority state. We’re going to be a majority Hispanic state in just six years. The voting electorate will be majority Hispanic within 15 years,” said the 41-year-old lawmaker in a recent speech before voters in Texas, according to The Monitor.“So as a political party, unless we’re able to capture at least a proportion of the mind share and the votes of this rapidly growing electorate, we as a political party, the Republicans, are destined for failure.”Villalba echoes the warning of many in his party who urge a softer tone when speaking about hot-button issues such as immigration.He is careful to avoid the controversial term “illegals” and opts instead for “unauthorized people.”“We’ve got to do a better job of communicating our ideas without alienating Latinos,” he said to the crowd. He has been speaking to different GOP and voters groups, bringing the same message.A 2010 report by the Pew Hispanic Center on Texas’ Latino voters showed that Latinos accounted for 36 percent of the state’s population, and nearly 4 million are eligible to vote.A 2013 report, by Pew Research Center, said that the Republican Party’s image among Hispanics has deteriorated in recent years, citing a poll that showed that 10 percent of Hispanic registered voters say the GOP has more concern for Hispanics than the Democratic Party.“Latino voters have leaned more towards the Democrats and supported Democratic presidential candidates in growing shares,” the Pew report said.At the same time, Latinos have showed a willingness to vote Republican when the candidate appeals to them.Texas’ own George W. Bush got nearly half of the Latino vote when he ran for governor in 1998, and then got more than 40 percent of the Latino vote when he ran for president in 2004, according to Pew.“Republican Latinos are rare, but we shouldn’t be,” said Villalba to the voters. He added that he and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, another Texas Republican, were sort of “unicorns.”The state lawmaker said that Republicans and Latinos were a natural fit because they shared many values.A fellow Texas Republican said getting Latinos to go red at the polls would be challenging.“Traditionally, it's been Democrat,” said Javier Villalobos, the Hidalgo County Republican chairman. “It's hard to break tradition. They were brought up believing that you have to go and vote Democrat.”Democrat Latinos conceded that the ethnic community shares some views with the Republican party, but they also different in significant ways.“I think that Mexican-Americans tend to be fiscally conservative. Also with respect to religion they tend to be conservative, and they don't like big government,” said state Rep. Terry Canales.“However, from a social aspect, and with respect to equality, I think that the Hispanic community is definitely more in line with the Democratic Party,” he said. “When it comes to helping out your fellow citizens and those in need, I think that's where the philosophical difference lies.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Thai police arrest senior protest leader for insurrection, court turns him loose on bail BANGKOK –  Thai police have arrested a key anti-government protest leader but a court allowed him to go free on bail hours later.Department of Special Investigation Director-General Tharit Pengdit said Saturday that immigration police detained Sakhontee Phattiyagul at Bangkok's international airport upon his arrival from a trip to the U.S. He says that Sakhontee was arrested Friday night on multiple charges, including insurrection.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTSakhontee is a leader of the People's Democratic Reform Committee, which has been staging militant anti-government demonstrations in Thailand's capital since November. The group wants Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step down and disrupted a general election held in February.Thai media reported that a court on Saturday allowed Sakhontee's release on 600,000 baht ($18,600) bail. 
There is still hope for Democrats in 2014 Naval Academy football team co-captains Cody Peterson, left, and Matt Aiken, stand with President Barack Obama after presenting him with a jersey during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, Friday, April 18, 2014, where the president awarded the Commander-in-Chief Trophy's to the United States Naval Academy football team. Navy finished the 2013 campaign with a 9-4 record, won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy for the ninth time in the last 11 years. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Is there any way Democrats can win the 17 seats they need to capture the House majority this November?In one word: Yes.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTDemocrats picked up 8 seats two years ago despite widespread predictions of losses. They lost 12 seats in 2012 by less than five percentage points and another 18 seats by less than 10 percentage points.Also keep in mind that every poll shows the public agrees with Democrats on the big issues – gay marriage, pay equity for women, immigration, gun control and budget cuts.Meanwhile, the GOP brand remains unpopular. The biggest advantage for House Democrats is that they are running against Republicans. That party’s good name suffered from last fall’s government shutdown, a strategy of obstruction that has paralyzed the Congress, and the recent vote in support of a budget that privatizes Medicare.Another plus for Democrats is that the GOP’s misguided message to voters for the fall elections – “ObamaCare is a Failure.” That claim is out of date with the success of 7 million people enrolling and 3 million more gaining insurance through Medicaid expansion. The ‘kill health care reform’ message, with endless GOP votes in the House for repeal, also irritates swing voters. Polling shows Independents want to fix ObamaCare, not kill it.But even with all those advantages the odds remain against Democrats getting enough wins to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House. Top political analysts, from Charlie Cook to Larry Sabato, currently predict Republicans adding two or three seats to easily retain their majority.Even the chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee, New York’s Rep. Steve Israel, told the National Press Club in early April: “It’s a tough climate for us right now.”In the 2012 House races, Democrats won 50.6 percent of America’s votes with a popular President Obama at the top of the ballot. Although they won the majority of votes they picked up only 8 seats, leaving them 17 shy of majority control. The Democrats’ voters are concentrated in blue states and even high turnout has minimal impact on Republican districts.Another problem for Democrats this year is the absence of President Obama’s name on the ballot. His star power has a history of driving up voter turnout among core Democrats, young people, women and minorities. But his name is not on this year’s ballot. And after the bungling of the start of computer enrollment for health care the president’s support among Democrats slipped. It has slipped even more among Independent voters. That has caused the president’s popularity to drop into the mid-40 percent range. History is pretty clear here. Second-term incumbents almost always see their party lose seats, an average of 29.Also bedeviling to Democrats are the results from polls asking voters if they prefer having Democrats or Republicans in charge of the House. Voters are about even, with Democrats holding only a slight, 41-39 percent edge, according to Real Clear Politics. That translates to political strategists as Democrats not having a strong political wind at their back as they sail into the election.But let me offer the contrarian argument: There is still hope for Democrats to win the House majority!First, the Democrats are lucky to be running against the House Republicans. Polls show the GOP has a measly 30 percent approval rating. House Republicans are even less popular with about an 18 percent approval rating, according to the most recent polls.Democrats in the House have nearly twice the approval rating, at 30 percent in the same Quinnipiac poll.Infighting between so-called ‘establishment Republicans’ and ‘Tea Party Republicans’ compounds the Republicans’ low favorability.  The party’s image is captive to incumbent Republican fears of not being sufficiently conservative to stave off a challenge from a Tea Party challenger in primary races. That’s why House Republicans just passed a budget with cuts to education and savings from making Medicare a private plan. Basically the House GOP, in their preoccupation with the far right, just handed Democrats a great weapon for beating up House Republicans in the fall races.“The Republican budget [is going to] define the next seven months,” said DCCC chair Israel. “With this budget the Republicans are turning their back on the middle class.”Another reason for the Democrats to have some optimism about House races is the retirement of several popular Republican incumbents and changing demographics. Here are two races that illustrate how holding the House majority may be more difficult for Republicans than the experts would have you believe.When moderate Republican Jon Runyan, R-N.J., retired, he set off a chaotic fight between Tea Party and establishment Republicans in the district. The local Republican establishment candidate, Tom MacArthur, is battling for the nomination against Tea Party insurgent Steve Lonegan. Not only are they tearing each other up before the general election, but also both are vulnerable to charges of being carpetbaggers. Each man served as mayor of a New Jersey town outside the district. Aimee Belgard, a Democrat, is now positioned as an even pick to win a seat that previously looked safe for Republicans.Then there is the demographic problem for Republicans. In Colorado’s 6th District, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman has seen a sharp increase among his Hispanic constituents. That rising tide led Coffman to back a bill to give legal status to children of illegal immigrants who are in school or join the military. But he is facing a formidable challenge from the former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff, who is telling voters about the GOP’s refusal to act on immigration reform.Those races explain why no one should be surprised if Democrats find a way to chalk up some House wins this fall.This column originally appeared at TheHill.com. Juan Williams joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1997 as a contributor and is also a co-host of FNC's "The Five," where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

Think Tank Says DHS Releases Criminal Immigrants, But Critics Counter Numbers Are Skewed A think tank that favors strict immigration enforcement said it obtained an internal Department of Homeland Security document showing that 68,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal records were released from detention instead of being deported.The organization, the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the release of these immigrants contradicts the Obama administration’s assertion that it has been tough on enforcement.The think tank, known for producing numerous studies and reports criticizing liberal immigration policies, concluded in an analysis of the leaked DHS document: “These findings raise further alarm over the Obama administration’s pending review of deportation practices, which reportedly may further expand the administration’s abuse of ‘prosecutorial discretion’ policies in 2011.”The Obama administration said it would implement prosecutorial discretion – putting at the top of the list for deportation and other enforcement measures those immigrants who pose a serious threat to public safety and national security. The term for criminal, as used by immigration, ranges from murder and rape to re-entering after deportation and using bogus identification documents.The CIS report about DHS statistics said that immigration agents encountered 722,000 “potentially deportable aliens,” and of those, the agency charged 195,000, or 25 percent.Immigrant advocates questioned CIS, accusing the think tank of having a history of skewing and distorting numbers to suit its immigration-restriction agenda.The Obama administration, which came under fire by proponents of more lenient immigration policies for its record number of deportations – nearly 2 million now – during his tenure, announced that it would reprioritize whom to detain.The administration said it would implement "prosecutorial discretion" – putting at the top of the list for deportation and other enforcement measures those immigrants who pose a serious threat to public safety and national security, violent criminals such as murderers.The term for criminal, as used by immigration, ranges from murder and rape to re-entering after deportation and using bogus identification documents.The CIS analysis does not provide a breakdown of the criminal offenses.Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, and a vocal advocate for strict immigration enforcement, said in a statement: “The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed. Even those with criminal convictions are being released. DHS is a department in crisis."Some lawmakers, meanwhile, are pushing for more discretion in immigration enforcement.On Monday, Reps. Bill Foster and Ted Deutch, both Democrats, and nearly 80 other lawmakers wrote a letter to the House Subcommittee on Homeland Security Appropriations asking for a review of the congressional immigrant detention bed quota.The lawmakers requested that the committee remove the requirement that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the DHS agency tasked with arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants, detain at least 34,000 people per day in immigrant detention "Often referred to as the detention bed mandate, this policy wastes taxpayer dollars by forcing ICE to forgo alternatives to detention that are far less costly and equally as effective," the letter said. "We currently spend nearly $2 billion a year, or $5.4 million every day, on immigration detention.""This arbitrary and costly detention bed mandate runs counter to the best practices of law enforcement," it added. "Indeed, no other law enforcement agency is subject to a quota dictated by Congress for the number of people it must keep in jail each day."On Monday afternoon, ICE gave Fox News a statement in response to the CIS report.“In Fiscal Year 2013 the agency removed 216,000 convicted criminals ... Nearly 60 percent of ICE’s total removals had been previously convicted of a criminal offense, and that number rises to 82 percent for individuals removed from the interior of the U.S. The removal of criminal individuals is and will remain ICE’s highest priority.” Proponents of more lenient immigration policies criticized the CIS report as misleading.Benjamin Johnson, Executive Director of the American Immigration Council, said that the people released were not all actually “set free.”“Being released from ICE custody often means being issued a notice to appear in court, released with an ankle bracelet or released under an order of supervision,” he said. “These details were conveniently left out of the CIS analysis.”Also, Johnson said, “the 195,000 [of people charged] is completely misleading. Sadly, it isn’t necessary to be “charged” by ICE in order to be removed from the country.”He further explained: “For instance, this “charged” number does not include the 160,000 people who were removed based on the reinstatement of a prior removal or the 23,000 that were voluntarily returned to their country of birth,” he said.“And, the number likely does not include the additional 101,000 that were removed from the U.S. based on an expedited removal order, where they were summarily removed without ever having a chance to take their case before a judge or receive any meaningful due process.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

(AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)The Associated PressLONDON –  Britain's top Roman Catholic cleric has criticized U.K. politicians for fear-mongering on immigration issues, saying it is wrong to argue that newcomers are a drain on the economy.Immigration, a hot-button issue in Britain, got a jolt of attention following the loosening of restrictions on migrants from Bulgaria and Romania earlier this year, a move some warned would send Eastern Europeans flooding into Britain.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe Most Rev. Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster, said Britons should acknowledge immigrants' positive contribution "to our well-being and economy. "The archbishop, who is to be made a cardinal by Pope Francis in Rome this weekend, said Tuesday that "leaders ought to appeal to something more normal and more substantial than fear." 
Top Republicans support immigration reform, but stress border security must come first Jan. 23, 2014: GOP Rep. Paul Ryan recites the Pledge of Allegiance during an event in San Antonio, Texas.APTop Republicans made clear Sunday they want to improve the country’s immigration system but will not negotiate until U.S. borders are first secured.“This is not trust but verify. This is a verify and trust approach,” Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan told ABC’s “This Week.” “Security first, no amnesty, then we might be able to get somewhere.”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTRyan’s comments follow GOP House leadership releasing a plan last week that outlines a path toward legal status for some of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now in the United States.The plan includes tighter border security but no plan for those living in the U.S. illegally to achieve citizenship, a deal many conservatives consider amnesty. Ryan, a member of House leadership and chairman of the House Budget Committee, also repeated that fellow party members don’t trust that the president will enforce border laws after a deal on immigration is reached.“Those things have to be in law, in practice and independently verified before the rest of the law can occur," he said. "So it's a security force first, non-amnesty approach."Ryan also acknowledged that the possibility of the House passing a bill that could reach the president's desk by the end of the year is still "clearly in doubt."The Democrat-controlled Senate this past summer passed comprehensive immigration reform that included a 13-year path to citizenship for some living illegally in the U.S. But reform legislation has remained stalled in the GOP-led House over the citizenship issue and concern about Senate Democrats dominating should negotiators from both chambers meet to negotiate a compromise deal.President Obama indicated last week that he might be open to legal status first, but restated such a plan cannot lead to two permanent categories of people – citizens and non-citizens.“We think that was a pretty good step,” White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough said Sunday on NBC’s “This Week” about the GOP plan. “We feel pretty good that we’ll get this done this year.”Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Republicans should proceed with immigration reform because it’s the right thing to do, “not because of what some pollster tells us.”Jindal, vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, disagreed with the 2014 election strategy that Republicans should just let Obama and Democratic candidates stew in the problems associated with ObamaCare.“There are a lot of folks in the Republican Party that would tell you the president is doing so poorly right now in the polls and especially with the flawed implementation and design of the Affordable Care Act that … we should stay out of his way and run 2014 as a referendum on that,” Jindal said. “I’m not one of those people.”He also said the country should change its immigration system to "high wall, broad gate."   Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
To Save Mom From Deportation, Daughter Goes On Hunger Strike Outside The White House “Cynthia, they are taking your mom!”These were the chilling words Cynthia Diaz’s father screamed on a Saturday morning in May 2011 as she awoke in her bed. Confused, she approached the front door and saw 10 officers. Her mother handcuffed. Taken into a van. An ICE raid had changed her life forever. “My mom answered the door and she was still in her pajamas and they took her just like that,” Diaz told Fox News Latino in a video interview.Diaz, 18, is a U.S. citizen and one of three immigration activists who on Tuesday began a hunger strike outside The White House in Washington D.C. demanding their loved ones be released from immigration detention and not deported. The strike is part of the 'Not 1 More' deportation movement. They are also hoping to pressure President Barack Obama to halt needless deportations of non-criminals and immigrants with low level convictions which, they say, are tearing families apart. A recent New York Times article reported two-thirds of deportations under Obama's presidency were of people with either no criminal backgrounds or minor violations. “I’m only 18. I’m a small figure. But I’m strong mentally and spiritually and I know I have a lot of support, so as long as I can I will be on a hunger strike in front of President Obama’s house,” she said.Diaz is studying at the University of Arizona on a full ride scholarship, but her mother, Maria Del Rosario Rodriguez, is an undocumented immigrant. She was deported in 2011 and re-entered the country illegally in March; now she is sitting in an immigration detention center. Rodriguez crossed the U.S.- Mexico border joining 150 others as part of the ‘Bring Them Home’ protest.“The point she was trying to make was that she deserves to be home with her family and Phoenix is her home and not Mexico, where she doesn’t even know the country,” said Diaz, who said her mother came to the United States when she was 14, is a good citizen who never even had a traffic ticket, graduated from high school, attended community college, and had her small business in Phoenix.“We want our family members back. I miss my mom a lot. Our house in Phoenix is not home anymore without her warmth there. It’s really difficult for me. I had to grow up really fast. I had to take care of myself and my little brother. She wasn’t there to see my high school graduation and I hope to bring her back really soon so she can at least see my brother’s graduation. My brother is a sophomore in high school.”Diaz also told Fox News Latino she feels abandoned by Obama.“I remember my grandpa, he’s a citizen of the United States and I remember him voting for President Obama because Obama promised the first thing he was going to do was help immigration reform and until today he hasn’t done anything but DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), and if he can do DACA, I know he can do DACA for all,” she said.“I know Obama says he’s doing everything he can. But he’s just saying and not really doing.”Bryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).

Trinidadians among 13 facing terror charges in Venezuela A court in Caracas ruled Thursday that 13 people - including five Trinidadian nationals - arrested last week will be held pending trial on charges of terrorism and criminal conspiracy, the Venezuelan Attorney General's Office said.The defendants were surprised at a capital hotel in possession of computers, sophisticated communications gear and military apparel, the AG's office said in a statement.Immigration inspectors and personnel from the Sebin intelligence service found the group during a search of the hotel for undocumented immigrants.Three of the defendants, Sebin agent Rafael Duran and police officers Jose Montañez and Fery Molina, were training the other 10 in the use of firearms, the AG's office said.Besides the eight citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, the group includes two recently naturalized Venezuelans who hail from Guyana and Haiti, respectively.The case comes against the backdrop of weeks of anti-government demonstrations that have left 35 dead across Venezuela.Fatalities include both opponents and supporters of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, as well as bystanders and members of the security forces.Authorities have charged more than a dozen police and soldiers with violating the human rights of demonstrators, while the government likewise accuses radical opposition elements of fomenting violence.

Foreign Teachers In Texas Face Deportation Due To School District's Visa Handling Blunder A few years ago, a school district in Texas found itself with a booming immigrant population and few teachers who spoke Spanish. So they started an ambitious recruitment program that brought in 260 teachers – from Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela – to meet their growing demand.Now, about six years later, 23 of those teachers are facing deportation after the Garland Independent School District apparently bungled their temporary work visas, or H-1B. Federal authorities are investigating the school district over the blunder and an administrator, teacher and associate superintendent have been placed on leave.The problem centers on work done by a law firm, which has since been fired. The firm allegedly asked the teachers to pay for the sponsorship of their H-1B, an apparent violation of the visa requirement. Federal law mandates that the sponsoring organization – the district, in this case, not the teachers – cover the $20,000 in costs for each applicant.“Totally we were naïve,” Francisco Marcano, 41, a Venezuelan teacher facing deportation told The Dallas Morning-News. “I came to my employer that I trusted completely. The lawyer said we were going to have a long-term relationship and to apply for the H-1B visa.”The teachers, some of whom received their master’s degree in the U.S. and were recruited from other districts in the country, had been promised that once their visa expired they would receive legal residency. But once the work visas – which only last six years – were about to expire, their applications for permanent residency kept getting denied. When they submitted paperwork to appeal the decision, the district realized there had been a significant gaffe.Once it realized the mistake, the school board turned the investigation over to the Department of Homeland Security and changed law firms. An in-house investigation found that the school board didn't do enough to find qualified teachers that were legal residents."The District and some of its employee are victims of those irregularities," Harry Jones, a lawyer the school board hired to conduct the investigation, told FOX 4 in Dallas-Fort Worth. "It looks like somebody was getting the fees that should not have been. That's what we're investigating."District Superintendent Bob Morrison told the Morning-News that because of the limits of immigration law, there is nothing the district could do for the teachers – even though they have been doing a good job and did nothing wrong.“We are saddened that some of the teachers do not have enough time left in their temporary immigration status for the transition to permanent residence,” Morrison said in a statement.The teachers have been told that the district will reimburse the fees they paid but there is nothing that could be done to extend their visas.That brings little consolation to some of the teachers, some whose children were born in the United States.“We are more worried about our legal status because we want to continue to work legally,” Bernardo Montes-Rodriguez, 41, who faces deportation in September when his visa expires, told the Morning-News. “I prefer to lose that money if we get the green card. That’s what we were promised.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Two Smuggling Tunnels Found, Both Ended Inside Warehouses In San Diego SAN DIEGO –  Federal agents working with Mexican authorities uncovered two sophisticated tunnels from Mexico to warehouses in Otay Mesa, federal officials said Friday.The first tunnel was discovered Tuesday evening as the result of a five-month investigation by the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lauren Mack said. The tunnel is about 600 yards long and ends inside a warehouse at 10145 Via de la Amistad.The tunnel entrance is a 70-foot shaft equipped with a pulley system to hoist smuggled goods into the warehouse, according to an ICE news release. The underground passage is reinforced with wooden trusses, has electric lighting and a crude rail system.Investigators arrested a 73-year-old Chula Vista woman on Wednesday. She is suspected of supervising operations at the warehouse.A second more sophisticated tunnel was discovered Thursday with help from Mexican investigators. It ends in another warehouse at 10005 Marconi Drive. The 700-yard tunnel has a multi-level electric rail system and ventilation, investigators said.“Here we are again, foiling cartel plans to sneak millions of dollars of illegal drugs through secret passageways that cost millions of dollars to build,” said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. “Going underground is not a good business plan. We have promised to locate these super tunnels and keep powerful drug cartels from taking their business underground and out of sight, and once again, we have delivered on that promise.”Agents did not find any drugs in either warehouse.Federal authorities have found five other cross-border tunnels in San Diego County the last four years. Since 2006, they have detected at least 80 underground passageways used by smugglers along the U.S.-Mexico border, most of them in California and Arizona, officials said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Udall on the rocks in Colorado U.S. Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo.APBuzz Cut: ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTUDALL ON THE ROCKS IN COLORADOWhy did incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., take the risky step this week of making his first television ad of the cycle a social issue attack? A new Quinnipiac University poll tells us why. The race, previously considered a safe Democratic retention, is now dead head. Udall, who led all challengers in February, is in a statistical tie with Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. When asked whether Udall should be re-elected, 46 percent of respondents said no and 40 percent said yes. That number was tied at 42 percent two months ago. Udall’s early move to launch a scary spot about abortion reflects a candidate concerned about his political base. Udall leads among women 52 percent to Gardner’s 35 percent, while Gardner leads among men, 53 to 38. Udall has consistently low favorability with Colorado voters while most voters haven’t made up their minds about Gardner. Launching this attack now will surely drive up Gardner’s negatives among pro-choice voters, but won’t do anything to help Udall enhance his own droopy digits.About ObamaCare - Whatever they know or don’t know about the candidates in the race, voters seem to have formed clear attitudes about the contestants’ positions. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said they were opposed ObamaCare, including 62 percent of independent voters. Voters supported Gardner’s health care policies over Udall’s 57 percent to 36 percent. They preferred Gardner’s stance on the economy 53 percent to 40 percent for Udall.[KDVR reports that Americans for Prosperity will remove an image of President Obama and Udall from its newest ad after it was revealed that the picture came from remarks given after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colo.]Pipeline of votes - A new ad from conservative group American Commitment called the “Colorado Steyer Infection” focuses on green-energy billionaire Tom Steyer bankrolling of Udall’s campaign. “Now Mark Udall is helping Steyer kill the Keystone Pipeline…even though Coloradans strongly support it” and that it’s “a cold slap in the face of American workers.” No Democrat finds himself in a trickier position than Udall when it comes to the stalled Keystone Pipeline project. Unlike red-state Democrats who can symbolically bash the president’s delay of the project with little fear of angering home-state constituencies, Udall has to keep Denver and Boulder liberals on board. But the project seems to be overwhelmingly popular among more moderate voters in the energy-rich state. Udall has not taken a public stance on the project. It’s understandable. Liberal groups are beginning to punish Democrats who do not toe the line on opposing the pipeline and Steyer stands ready to jump in against those who do not conform.[WaPo editorial: “Keystone XL’s continued delay is absurd”]MASSIVE OBAMACARE SUIT FILED IN NEVADAKLAS: “Confidential documents which appear to be from a Nevada Health Link employee may reveal huge problems within the state health exchange.

General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, an outside economic adviser to President Obama, confirmed at a shareholder meeting Wednesday that the health sector is experiencing uncertainty.

But, speaking at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama spoke dismissively of the longstanding territorial dispute that has intensified in recent weeks. “My hope is that China will continue to engage with us and other countries in the region – where we do not take a position on the particular sovereignty of this piece of land or this rock – but we do take a position in making sure that all countries are following basic international procedures in resolving these disputes.”BAIER TRACKS: AFGHAN LOSSES MAY CREATE POLITICAL PRESSURE FOR WITHDRAWAL…“The sad news this morning that three U.S. doctors were killed in Afghanistan brings the number of Americans killed so far this month to five. In all, more than 2,300 Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan since the beginning of the war in 2001. There is now a growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats who say that if the U.S. is going to draw down to fewer than 10,000 troops in the country, then it would be better for all American forces to come home. Today's attack, like many before, involved an Afghan soldier in uniform – or someone pretending to be an Afghan solider – opening fire. Administration critics point out that President Obama hardly ever talks about Afghanistan and, frankly, as polls show, people have forgotten why we're there.  As the November midterm elections approach, be on the lookout for more calls from both parties to bring everyone home.” – Bret Baier  THE JUDGE’S RULING: LIFTING THE VEILFox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano considers a court’s ruling that the Obama Administration must reveal its secret legal rationale for killing Americans believed to be part of overseas militant groups: “Welcome to the strange new world of Barack Obama’s War on Terror, in which there are no declarations of war against countries that foment or harbor enemy activities, as the Constitution authorizes, and in which the president claims the powers of a king by killing whomever he wishes under a rationale that his lawyers wrote for him and that he has desperately tried to keep secret. The Obama administration is probably right to fear the revelation of this so-called legal way to kill.

Univision, Telemundo Networks Fend Off Report Claiming Newscasts Have Liberal Bias The conservative-leaning media watchdog group Media Research Center (MRC) released a study saying that the nightly newscasts from the main U.S. Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision tend to skew liberal on domestic issues.The watchdog group said from November through February, in the news programs on Noticiero Univision and Noticiero Telemundo, about 45 percent of stories on domestic policy on immigration reform and health care tilted liberal, 49 percent were balanced or neutral and 6 percent were conservative, Politico reported.Now, the networks are fighting back, claiming they don’t have a liberal bias.Camilo Pino, a spokesman for Telemundo, told Politico they strive to be “transparent, impartial and factual” in their reporting.“Noticias Telemundo stands for accuracy, fairness and independence, while we strive to meet the highest ethical standards in the industry,” he said. “We are devoted to our audience of U.S. Hispanics and strive to offer them the most reliable and objective information on the subjects that matter the most to them.”Jose Zamora with Univision told Politico the network is committed to providing all points of view on an issue and has “an open invitation to elected officials and representatives from all sides to address our community on issues of importance and relevance.”Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, dubbed the Brian Williams of Hispanic T.V., is a vocal advocate for immigration reform. He’s pressed, and even criticized, President Obama on the issue and has attended rallies that advocate for more lenient immigration policies.Critics have also called out Telemundo for allegedly playing a advocacy role on immigration reform -- rather than simply reporting on it.MRC’s study also found that the two networks featured Democratic and liberal-leaning groups more frequently than Republicans or conservative groups. However, they also accused conservatives of not reaching out more to Latino media.“The main things is on domestic U.S. policy, the administration and their allies … are really dominating the narrative on major U.S. political stories,” said Ken Oliver-Mendez, director of MRC’s new Spanish-language watchdog group, MRC Latino. “So that points to a real need for conservatives to do a better job and for networks to do a better job including conservatives.”The study is part of the kickoff of MRC Latino, which officially launched on Tuesday.MRC President Brent Bozell said on Monday they hope the study will lead to broader representation in Spanish-language and hoped to meet with Telemundo and Univision executives to discuss the study’s results. In their statements, neither networks commented on whether they would meet with MRC.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
US authorities in California return man suspected in rape and killing in Mexico SAN DIEGO –  U.S. authorities have extradited a Mexican man wanted for allegedly raping two women and strangling one of them more than a decade ago.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say 41-year-old Javier Diaz-Diaz was turned over to Mexican authorities Tuesday at the San Diego-area border crossing.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe turnover came within a day of the man's release from a California prison, where he served time following a 2009 conviction for spousal rape.A warrant issued in the Mexican state of Jalisco (hah-LEES'-koh) alleges that Diaz-Diaz raped a woman in 2002 and raped another woman 10 months later, strangling her and running her over with a car at least four times.It wasn't immediately known if Diaz-Diaz has an attorney. 
U.S.-Born Latino Population Growing At Faster Rate Than Foreign-Born, Reversing Longtime Trend Hispanics born in the United States are driving the growth of the Latino population, a reversal from the longtime trend of immigration being its engine.Since 2000, the U.S.-born Latino population has grown faster than its foreign-born component, which has stalled since 2010, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center.Just short of 50 percent of Hispanic adults in 2012 were foreign-born, down from 55 percent in 2007. Between 2000 and 2010, 9.6 million Latinos were born in the United States, compared to the 6.5 million Latinos who emigrated here. In that period, U.S. births made up 60 percent of the Latino population growth, the study said.The study attributed the change to several factors, among them a decline in Mexicans coming to the United States, people leaving the United States because of a weaker economy and, by extension, fewer job opportunities, and tighter border security.Regardless of the changes within Latino growth, it will likely to continue, the study said. The Latino population has grown six-fold since 1970, from 9.1 million to 53 million by 2012. That is larger than populations of many entire Latin American countries.The change has occurred as the number of Latinos turning into adults is growing. The study noted that about 800,000 U.S.-born Latinos are entering adulthood each year. That number is expected to rise to 1 million annually."That's really a reflection of this wave of U.S.-born young people entering adulthood and having an impact demographically on everything from … the labor market, colleges and universities and impacting a whole host of other institutions that are part of adulthood," said Mark Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the center and a co-author of the report, according to USA Today.The study also showed that the states with the largest Latino populations are: California, with 14.5 million, Texas, with 10 million, Florida, with 4.5 million, New York, with 3.6 million, and Illinois, with 2.1 million.The five states with the fastest-growing Latino populations are Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky and South Dakota.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
5 Charged In Human Smuggling Operation That Trapped 115 People In Stash House HOUSTON (AP) –  Five men, at least two of them from Mexico, are accused of using guns and threats to hold 115 people hostage in a small Houston house unless they paid ransom to continue their illegal entry into the United States.A criminal complaint from Department of Homeland Security Special Agent Andres Garcia Jr. said the people, discovered last week crammed into the home of less than 1,300 square feet, were stripped of their shoes and most of their clothing to keep them from escaping.They also were threatened with violence if they did not comply and there were instances of some being kicked and beaten and females being groped, the complaint said. One pregnant girl was among people struck with a wooden paddle.The five men — José Aviles-Villa, Jonathan Solorzano-Tavila, Antonio Barruquet-Hildiberta, José Cesmas-Borja and Eugenio Sesmas-Borja — stood handcuffed and shackled during a brief court appearance Tuesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances Stacy on hostage-taking, weapons and conspiracy charges.Stash house discoveries involving more than 100 captives are not uncommon in South Texas but the raid in Houston, about a five-hour drive from Mexico, is the largest in the city in several years."This is an alien smuggling case, basically, where a firearm was used in connection with this offense," Stacy told them. "Your lawyer can more fully describe the accusations against you."One of the men wore shorts, others were in jeans. All listened on headphones as the proceedings were translated for them into Spanish. Stacy reviewed questionnaires that indicated all had wives and children. She agreed to a request from each for a court-appointed attorney. The judge specified the attorney be Spanish-speaking but denied immediate bail because the defendants were considered a flight risk.A bond hearing was set for Thursday. The defendants also were entitled to a probable cause hearing, she said.Conviction on the hostage-taking charge carried up to a life prison term and $250,000 fine, federal prosecutor Julie Searle said. Convictions on the weapons charge could result in up to 10 years in prison and conspiracy up to 20 years, plus fines, she said.Aviles-Villa and Cesmas-Borja told Houston police they were from Mexico and in the U.S. illegally, according to the criminal complaint. The immigration status of the three other men was not immediately clear.One of the people held hostage told authorities Solorzano-Tavila appeared to be the person in charge at the stash house, where smugglers bring the people they've brought into the U.S. illegally and keep them until they or their family members pay a ransom.Captives told authorities they were held under armed guard. Doors were locked with dead bolts and windows were covered with plywood. A wood paddle, stun gun, ammunition, shotgun and rifle were found at the home, according to the criminal complaint.Aviles-Villa and Cesmas-Borja were in a car that had left the house that police pulled over because it had no rear-view mirror. Officers spotted a handgun "protruding from beneath the front passenger seat," according to the court document.A woman had contacted Houston police earlier about the possible abduction of her daughter and two small grandchildren. The criminal complaint said she paid smugglers $15,000 to deliver her three relatives to Chicago, then was told they would "disappear" if she didn't pay $13,000 more.Investigators determined that phone calls made to her came from the home and put it under surveillance. After the traffic stop, officers went to the house and found the captives. In all, 99 males and 16 females were being held. More than a dozen were juveniles. Among the people inside were the daughter and grandchildren of the woman whose call initiated the investigation.Solorzano-Tavila, Barruquet-Hildiberta and Sesmas-Borja were apprehended trying to flee after police arrived March 19.Police have said the people being held primarily were from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.One of those, Mario Ernesto Guzmán-Figueroa, said he left his home in Honduras a month ago and was headed for Atlanta, had agreed to pay $3,400 to be smuggled from El Salvador to Georgia and still owed $2,000."Guzmán-Figueroa was told that he had 12 days to pay or he would be beaten, placed in a black plastic bag, and then thrown on the side of the road," Garcia said in the complaint.One woman from El Salvador, Dilcia Jiménez-Alvarado, said she left a month ago for New York, had paid about $7,500 to be smuggled but was told in Houston she needed to pay $5,000 more.Authorities earlier said the house was filthy inside, had power but no hot water and only one toilet.Stash house discoveries involving more than 100 captives are not uncommon in South Texas but the raid in Houston, about a five-hour drive from Mexico, is the largest in the city in several years.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
U.S. Farmers Blame GOP For Crippling Immigrant Labor Shortage They were an ironclad voting bloc for Republicans.But the dynamics may be changing for agriculture business owners, who are struggling to find American workers willing to do the physically demanding work, and struggling to find even undocumented workers amid stricter immigration enforcement along the border and inside the United States.And while consumption of fresh produce by Americans has risen, the farmers have not been able to benefit because domestic production has fallen short, leading to a $1.4 billion annual loss in farm income, according to The New York Times.The result: farmers are looking at the GOP as the culprit.Republicans, some say, have blocked many of the changes in immigration policies that could resolve many of their labor problems.And so they have become one of the most vocal industry groups putting pressure on Congress – particularly Republicans – to advance immigration legislation, which has stalled in the House of Representatives.Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers Association, has made numerous trips to Washington D.C. to plead the case for more flexible immigration laws.“We’ve had secure borders with Mexico for the last decade,” he said, according to the Times. “We don’t have that argument at this point. Now we want people to see the real damage of not doing anything, which is a declining work force, and it means losing production to foreign countries.”Some Republicans are parting with their party on the issue and backing Democrat-led immigration measures. Reps. David Valadao and Jeff Denham, both of California, are among a few Republicans who are supporting a measure in the House that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. But many Republicans are against supporting any measure that gives a break to undocumented immigrants. They say that such measures amount to amnesty, or rewarding law breakers.Saying they feel desperate, agricultural groups are opting to hold back campaign donations.Nassif said his group is withholding hundreds of thousands of dollars in congressional races, an about-face from its generous support in the past.“I can tell you if the Republicans don’t put something forward on immigration, there is going to be a very loud hue and cry from us in agriculture,” the Times quoted Nassif as saying. “We are a tremendously important part of the party, and they should not want to lose us.”Mike Gempler, head of the Washington Growers League, is quoted in the Washington Post echoing the sentiment.“We’re seeing a lack of response to our needs and concerns from significant parts of the Republican caucus in the House,” Gempler said. “They either have ideological issues or they are catering to a more reactionary crowd.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
U.S. House GOP To Introduce Shortly New Immigration Plan, Including Path To Legal Status House Republicans are working on an immigration plan that would give potentially millions of undocumented immigrants a chance to permanently live and work in the United States.The plan, which is reportedly days away from being released to the public, will cover ideas on how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, the expansion of visas for certain foreign workers, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to published reports, such as one in online news publication Politico.The path to legalization’s inclusion in the plan – which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.The path to legalization’s inclusion in the Republican plan expected to be released later this month is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally. They maintain that that giving those immigrants any kind of break would amount to amnesty, or rewarding law-breakers.That stance created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some – including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida – arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.Politico reported that House Speaker John Boehner, who is from Ohio, wants the plan, also referred to as “principles,” completed and made public before President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.The plan commits itself to the idea – which is heavily favored by many Republicans – that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did.Obama told Senate Democrats in a closed-door meeting this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a political publication in Washington, D.C.The president reportedly told Democrats in the private meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney performed extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.Obama obtained three-quarters of Latino votes cast in 2012, while Romney received barely one-fourth.Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, was quoted in The Hill as saying: “I think our Republican colleagues realize that to be blocking immigration reform is not good for them.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino

U.S. Praises Mexico For Drug Kingpin Arrest, Applauds Law Enforcement Cooperation WASHINGTON (AP) –  The relationship between U.S. law enforcement and their counterparts in Mexico has never been stronger, and the arrest of Mexico's most wanted drug cartel leader earlier this year is proof of that, a senior Homeland Security Department official told Congress on Wednesday.James Dinkins, executive associate director for homeland security at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the House Homeland Security Committee that while ICE, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshal Service and other U.S. agencies helped end the decade-long manhunt for Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman Loera, the operation was led by Mexico and should be a considered a win for that country. It's a victory that shows the strength of the relationship between law enforcement in the two countries, he said."We have the best relationship with our Mexican counterparts that we've ever had," Dinkins said. "They have proven to be a key partner of ICE."Dinkins said the relationship goes beyond the targeting of Mexico's top drug cartel leaders to include investigations and arrests of child predators and the takedown of transnational tunnels used to smuggle drugs across the border. Dinkins said Mexican authorities reacted "within minutes" of being alerted to a tunnel recently discovered at the border. That operation led to the seizure of millions of dollars worth of drugs and three arrests.The Guzman arrest "sent a clear message to the world that Mexico is willing and able to tackle the most sophisticated drug cartel in the world," Dinkins said.Alan Bersin, the Homeland Security Department's assistant secretary of international affairs, said Guzman's earlier this year and the apprehension of the leaders of the ruthless Los Zetas cartel last year is a clear sign that Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto is focused on tackling problems that impact both countries.In his written testimony, Bersin also highlighted previous operations that targeted drug organizations and an agreement to begin repatriating criminal immigrants to the interior of Mexico, rather than deporting them to violent border cities.Guzman was arrested in a pre-dawn raid at a high-rise condominium building in the coastal city of Mazatlan, Mexico, in late February. A wiretap being monitored by ICE agents in Southern Arizona provided the final clue to Guzman's whereabouts days after he narrowly avoided capture in Culiacan, the capitol of Mexico's Sinaloa state.Dinkins did not discuss on Wednesday how U.S. authorities helped in the capture, instead giving credit to the Mexican military unit that captured Guzman without gunfire.Since Guzman's arrest some lawmakers have pressed for his extradition. He faces multiple indictments in the United States, including in Chicago, New York and San Diego.John Feeley, principal deputy at the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said the Justice Department is the lead agency in asking for Guzman's extradition but the U.S. "will be in discussions with the Mexicans.""But it may not result in immediate transfer," Feeley said.Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican, complained that those discussions should already be taking place. Broun said he worried that Mexico may be unable to keep Guzman jailed or prevent him from continuing to run his drug empire from jail.Guzman was convicted in Mexico of drug and other offenses in the early 1990s and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in 2001."This is a question of trust and confidence in our partnership," Feeley said. "We have every trust and confidence that the Mexicans are able to hold him."U.S. law enforcement officials and the Homeland Security Department have long touted the relationship with their Mexican counterparts. But in the early days of Pena Nieto's term in 2013, his government ordered that all contact with U.S. law enforcement would go through "a single window." Sergio Alcocer, deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said at the time that all contact would be channeled through the federal Interior Ministry, the agency that controls security and domestic policy.It was a dramatic shift from the direct information sharing that went on among agencies during President Felipe Calderon's administration.Dinkins did not address that new policy Wednesday, saying only that the relationship continues to grow.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
USPS worker allegedly takes disability, goes fishing ANCHORAGE, Alaska –  A former U.S. Postal Service employee in Anchorage was arraigned Friday on charges he accepted at least $334,000 in disability and worker's comp payments while he spent his summers fishing.The U.S. attorney's office says in a Friday release that 56-year-old Amacio Zamora Agcaoili Jr. was indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts, including theft of government funds.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThey claim every summer between 2009 and 2013, he went dipnetting and fishing on multiple occasions despite being on disability.Assistant U.S. Attorney Yvonne Lamoureux also claims Agcaoli lied about not working when he was paid for preparing tax returns and immigration paperwork.Authorities also claim he failed to tell the Social Security Administration about his worker's comp payments, to which he wasn't entitled. 
US seizes $43M worth of cocaine near Puerto Rico; 3 suspects sought SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico –  U.S. authorities in Puerto Rico have seized $43 million worth of cocaine off the island's southeast coast.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Friday that more than 3,370 pounds (1,529 kilograms) of cocaine were found aboard a wooden boat traveling toward the coastal town of Patillas. Authorities said three people aboard the boat fled into the brush late Wednesday and were not found.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe announcement comes two days after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said officials seized 1.7 metric tons (3,700 pounds) of cocaine off Puerto Rico's north coast. The cocaine had an estimated street value of $50 million. 
U.S. Supreme Court Wonât Take Up Maryland Immigration Case FREDERICK, Md. (AP) –  The U.S. Supreme Court is refusing to hear a Frederick County immigration enforcement dispute. The high court said Monday it won't hear the county's appeal of a ruling last August by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The dispute now goes back to U.S. District Court in Baltimore for further proceedings.Salvadoran immigrant Roxana Santos claims that two Frederick County sheriff's deputies illegally discriminated against her in 2008 when they arrested her on a civil immigration warrant in Frederick.She says they detained her and checked her immigration status only because she looks Hispanic. The county says Santos raised suspicion by trying to hide as the deputies drove past her as she ate lunch outside her workplace.Read more at foxbaltimore.com.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
US weighs curbing deportations for illegal immigrants without serious criminal records A border patrol vehicle observes border fencing in Douglas, Ariz.ReutersHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is weighing limiting deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who don't have serious criminal records, according to two people with knowledge of his deliberations.The change, if adopted following an ongoing review ordered by President Barack Obama, could shield tens of thousands of immigrants now removed each year solely because they committed repeat immigration violations, such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported, failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court date.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTHowever, it would fall short of the sweeping changes sought by activists. They want Obama to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups, such as the parents of any children born in the U.S.John Sandweg, who served until February as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said he had promoted the policy change for immigrants without serious criminal records before his departure and that it was being weighed by Johnson. An immigration advocate who's discussed the review with the administration also confirmed the change was under consideration. The advocate spoke on condition of anonymity because the proceedings are confidential."Any report of specific considerations at this time would be premature," Clark Stevens, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said Monday. Stevens said Johnson "has undergone a very rigorous and inclusive process to best inform the review," including seeking input from people within DHS as well as lawmakers of both parties, and other stakeholders.The approach outlined by Sandweg and the immigration advocate would change the existing priority categories that now include immigrants who've re-entered the country after they have been deported previously, and those who are fugitives from immigration proceedings. Such people would be taken off the priority list.The remaining priority categories focus on recent border-crossers and immigrants who pose a danger to national security or public safety or who've been convicted of crimes. Some of those categories might also be refined or changed, and others could be added."The time had come to focus ICE's efforts exclusively on public safety and national security," Sandweg said in explaining why he pushed for the change prior to his departure from the agency. He estimated that some 20,000 deported immigrants fell into the categories in question last year.The potential changes come as Johnson proceeds with a review ordered by Obama on how to make deportation policy more humane. With comprehensive immigration legislation stalled in the GOP-led House after passing the Senate last year, Obama has come under intense election-year pressure to stem deportations, which have neared 2 million on his watch, and allow more of the 11.5 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. to stay.Many activists, who've staged hunger strikes on the National Mall and outside the White House, want sweeping action by Obama to give legal certainty and work permits to millions more immigrants, like he did for those who arrived illegally as children and attended school or served in the military.It's not clear whether the administration ultimately will take such steps. Obama has said repeatedly his options are limited without action by Congress and has sought to keep the onus on House Republicans."The only way to truly fix it is through congressional action. We have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could," Obama said last week at a news conference. "We're going to review it one more time to see if there's more that we can do."For now, administration officials appear more focused, instead, on more limited, near-term steps that could still make a difference for the immigrant population, according to lawmakers and activists who've met with administration officials.Adjusting the department's priorities for deportation is one such approach. Depending on how it's done, it could have a significant impact by providing new guidance to ICE agents on the front lines. Activists want more wholesale changes; some say ICE agents don't always follow the priorities set by the administration."I think that is a step in the right direction, but not enough," said Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA de Maryland, an immigrant service organization. "We believe the president has the authority to stop deportations" of larger groups of people.At the same time, Obama would likely face GOP wrath for taking even the smallest steps toward providing relief to people in this country illegally. Republicans already accuse Obama's administration of subverting the law through previous moves to give "prosecutorial discretion" to immigration agents."We're already at a point where deportations are in a state of collapse and to go further would be exactly the wrong thing to do," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.The Obama administration's deportation priorities have been controversial, with the administration contending they're meant to keep the focus on criminals. Immigration activists argue that in reality, many people with a minor criminal record or no record are swept up.Advocates say part of the problem is that, although criminals are prioritized, people with no criminal record or a minor record can be removed if they've gotten caught up in the immigration system.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
U.S. Weighs Curbing Deportations, Tens Of Thousands Would Be Shielded WASHINGTON –  Tens of thousands of people who fall into categories that traditionally rendered them deportable could be spared under changes to deportation procedures currently under consideration by the Department of Homeland Security.According to two people with knowledge of his deliberations, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is weighing limiting deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who don't have serious criminal records, The change, if adopted following an ongoing review ordered by President Barack Obama, could shield many thousands of immigrants now removed each year solely because they committed repeat immigration violations, such as re-entering the country illegally after having been deported, failing to comply with a deportation order or missing an immigration court date.However, it would fall short of the sweeping changes sought by activists, who have grown increasingly frustrated by what they say is Obama's refusal to use executive powers to change some key aspects of U.S. immigration policy.They want Obama to expand a two-year-old program that grants work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as children to include other groups, such as the parents of any children born in the U.S.John Sandweg, who served until February as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said he had promoted the policy change for immigrants without serious criminal records before his departure and that it was being weighed by Johnson.

Republicans already accuse Obama's administration of subverting the law through previous moves to give "prosecutorial discretion" to immigration agents."We're already at a point where deportations are in a state of collapse and to go further would be exactly the wrong thing to do," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.The Obama administration's deportation priorities have been controversial, with the administration contending they're meant to keep the focus on criminals. Immigration activists argue that in reality, many people with a minor criminal record or no record are swept up.Advocates say part of the problem is that, although criminals are prioritized, people with no criminal record or a minor record can be removed if they've gotten caught up in the immigration system.Based on reporting by The Associated Press.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Vice President Joe Biden: Undocumented Immigrants Are Already Americans For Vice-President Joe Biden, sometimes a piece of paper is just a piece of paper, even when it comes to immigration status.Biden said on Thursday that undocumented immigrants are already Americans. The vice president told the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that most immigrants are working hard and just want to be able to step out of societal shadows and join the mainstream."You know, 11 million people living in the shadows I believe are already American citizens," he said. "Teddy Roosevelt said it better. Americanism, he said, is not a question of birthplace or creed. Or a line of descent. It's a question of principles, idealism and character."Biden wasn't done."These people are just waiting, just waiting for a chance to be able to contribute fully," he continued. "And by that standard 11 million undocumented aliens are already Americans, in my view. All they want - they just want a decent life for their kids, a chance to contribute to a free society, a chance to put down roots and help build the next great American century."Biden, like most Democrats, is calling on GOP House Speaker John Boehner to let the House vote on an immigration reform bill. The Senate passed a bill last year which supporters said would strengthen borders and give immigrants an earned path to citizenship.Critics of that bill call it amnesty for lawbreakers.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Virginia Grants In-State College Tuition To DREAMers ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) –  Attorney General Mark Herring on Tuesday instructed Virginia colleges to grant in-state tuition to potentially thousands of students who were previously considered ineligible because of their immigration status.The policy change, announced in front of hundreds of cheering immigration advocates at Northern Virginia Community College's Alexandria campus, is a change from the Democrat's Republican predecessors.In the past, the attorney general's office had advised that students who entered the country illegally were barred from receiving in-state tuition, even if they were children when they immigrated.Herring now says students can qualify for the reduced tuition under a special immigration status created by the Obama administration for certain young people brought to the U.S. as children.The change, he said, will allow students who have lived in Virginia to continue their education and become productive members of the workforce "instead of punishing them for the way their parents brought them to the United States as children."Herring said the change is immediate and applies to all public colleges in the state.The change brought immediate condemnation from Republicans who control Virginia's House of Delegates. They had rejected legislation that would have done the same thing."These issues should be considered, discussed and eventually resolved through the legislative and democratic processes, not by the unilateral actions of one individual," House Republican leaders, including Speaker William Howell, said in a joint statement.Whether students lacking legal status should receive in-state tuition has been an issue in Virginia and across the nation for more than a decade. In 2002, then-Attorney General Jerry Kilgore advised Virginia colleges that they should not even admit illegal immigrants, and if they did, they were barred from granting those students in-state tuition.In 2004, a federal judge in Alexandria tossed out a lawsuit attacking that policy.Much has changed since then, however. In 2012, Obama created a special immigration status, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), for immigrants between the ages of 15 and 32 who came to the U.S. before they turned 16. That status allows them to remain if they have graduated from high school or are enrolled as students and meet other conditions.Herring said the new category amounts to lawful immigration status for those who hold it, and he is therefore empowered to implement the change. Herring's office estimated that 8,100 Virginia residents have obtained lawful status under the 2012 program and are now eligible for in-state tuition.Herring said 19 states have taken similar action, either through state law or by administrative action.The change will be particularly meaningful in northern Virginia, home to most of the state's immigrant population. Robert Templin, president of Northern Virginia Community College, said that nearly half of all Virginia's Latino and Asian undergraduates are enrolled at either his school or at George Mason University.GMU's president, Angel Cabrera, attended Tuesday's announcement, and said the inability to obtain in-state tuition was a "definite barrier" to affected students who want to enroll at GMU.Dayana Torres, a sophomore at GMU who attends on a scholarship and now holds DACA status after coming to Virginia at the age of 9 from Colombia, said many of her friends take classes on a piecemeal basis, scraping up money to pay for community-college classes that cost three times as much for students who lack in-state status.Templin said the change is important for what it symbolizes as well."It is a signal to all New Americans who live in Virginia that our state recognizes the importance of developing their talent for the benefit of all Virginia," he said.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Voters Mixed Over Fraud Charges For NY Congressman Michael Grimm NEW YORK (AP) –  A congressional campaign that already was promising to be tightly contested became even more contentious when incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm was charged with evading taxes, news that voters in his Staten Island district met with mixed feelings.Eddie Garcia, 70, said he voted for Grimm twice, and "I plan to vote for him again."But others like Marc Patrick, 57, said he wouldn't even consider supporting a candidate with this kind of cloud hanging over him on Election Day. "This is supposed to be someone who respects the law, and that's certainly in question at this point," the retired teacher said.Grimm was charged Monday following a two-year investigation that initially focused on alleged attempts to bypass contribution limits. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer in federal court in Brooklyn to mail, wire and tax fraud charges in connection to a small Manhattan restaurant and was released on $400,000 bond secured by his Staten Island home.The lawmaker, using a World War II memorial across the street from the courthouse as a backdrop, later accused prosecutors of leaking "all kinds of innuendos and accusations to support a political witch hunt" intended to "assassinate my character." He vowed to return to work in Congress while fighting the charges."I know I'm a moral man, a man of integrity," he added. "And I also know I have a lot more service and leadership to provide this country, and that's exactly what I intend to do."But Grimm has even more of a challenge in running for re-election, Democratic strategist Phil Singer said.The indictment is "going to chase him every time he goes out on the campaign trail," Singer said.Republican strategist Hogan Gidley said, "Campaigns are difficult enough trying to stay on message and stay focused on your accomplishments without having to worry about federal indictments."Democrats have been eyeing Grimm's seat. The Democrats' favored candidate, former New York City Councilman Domenic Recchia, has been hammering Grimm over his ethics and has impressed Washington Democrats.Grimm stepped down Monday from the House Financial Services Committee. He told Republican House Speaker John Boehner he should be removed from the panel but said he plans to return once his legal issues are resolved. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi had sent a letter to Boehner saying Grimm should be removed, and a Boehner spokesman said the speaker believes the decision to step down was appropriate.House members suspected of crimes sometimes win re-election, but an indictment typically leads to resignation or defeat at the polls.FBI agents seized large amounts of cash when they raided the Washington home of Rep. William J. Jefferson, D-La., in May 2006, but voters re-elected him later that year. A federal grand jury indicted Jefferson on 16 corruption charges in June 2007, and he lost his 2008 bid for another term. He later was sentenced to prison.Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is one of the best-known lawmakers to face criminal charges. In 2005, a Texas grand jury indicted him on charges of trying to violate election laws. DeLay surrendered his leadership post but kept his House seat until June 2006. That's when he resigned, without seeking another term.U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said investigators uncovered the restaurant fraud as they conducted the campaign finance probe. She denied the prosecution was politically motivated and suggested more charges were possible."We follow the evidence and see where it goes. ... The investigation is broader and ongoing," she said.The 20-count indictment alleges the tax fraud began in 2007 after Grimm retired from the FBI and began investing in an Upper East Side eatery called Healthalicious. It accused him of trying to evade payroll, income and sales taxes by paying his workers, some in the country illegally, in cash.Authorities say Grimm left the business in 2010, the year he won his first term in Congress. A House Ethics Committee announced in November that he was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations.During the 2010 race, Grimm acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge. Three days after that, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman, Diana Durand, who had been romantically involved with Grimm, of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.Grimm, 44, made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about the campaign finance inquiry.After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report from a balcony in the Capitol, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said: "Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
White House denies migrants deported for minor offenses The U.S. administration denied Monday that the majority of the more than 2 million deportations since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009 have been of people who committed minor offenses, as The New York Times reported.Ninety-eight percent of deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been in line with the priorities set by the administration, with a focus on threats to national security, public safety and border security, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.The great majority of deportees were convicted of major crimes, such as aggravated offenses or repeated infractions.The White House has said the only ones expelled from the country are undocumented immigrants with a criminal record, members of organized crime, or those who hurt the community, though an investigation published Monday by The New York Times indicates that two-thirds of the more than 2 million deportations since Obama took office were of people who had committed minor offenses, such as traffic violations.Carney said that Obama's priority is to promote immigration reform that regularizes the status of the some 11 million undocumented immigrants who risk being expelled from the country."The president has made clear, he remains deeply concerned about the pain too many families feel from the separation that comes from our broken immigration system," the White House press secretary said.Though Obama came to power promising to speed up comprehensive immigration reform, the number of deportations has actually increased, particularly among those who commit minor misdemeanors.Carney said there is no other alternative for halting deportations than passing immigration reform.The Senate passed a bipartisan reform measure last June, but the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has declined to take up the matter.

White House declines comment on petition to deport the Biebs January 23, 2014. Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber is pictured in police custody in Miami Beach, Florida.ReutersThe White House has two words for those who want President Barack Obama to deport Justin Bieber: No comment.Nearly 275,000 people signed an Internet petition calling the Canadian-born teen idol reckless and asking Obama to revoke his green card. That's far more than required to merit an official response through the White House's "We the People" program.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTThe White House says it's sorry to disappoint, but it won't be commenting. It's citing a caveat that lets the White House decline to address certain petitions.But the White House is using the occasion to argue that an immigration overhaul could shrink deficits by nearly $1 trillion over two decades. The White House says that's equivalent to 12.5 billion concert tickets — or 100 billion copies of Bieber's debut album.+ FollowFOX411 on Facebook 
White House: No visa for Iran's UN ambassador pick  The White House announced Friday that the U.S. will not issue a visa to Iran's choice for U.N. ambassador, over concerns about his involvement in the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis in Tehran. The decision comes after Congress earlier this week approved a bill that would bar Hamid Abutalebi from stepping on U.S. soil. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the White House is reviewing that legislation but announced that Abutalebi would be barred anyway. ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT"We have informed the United Nations and Iran that we will not issue a visa to Mr. Abutalebi," Carney said. "We certainly share the intent of the bill passed by Congress as we have already told the U.N. and Iran that we will not issue a visa." State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was "not a viable nomination." Denying visas to U.N. ambassadorial nominees or to foreign heads of state who want to attend United Nations events in the United States is rare, if not unprecedented. American officials, though, have objected to the selection of Abutalebi because of his alleged participation in a Muslim student group that held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in the 1979 incident. The concerns became a rare point of bipartisan agreement in Congress. The House unanimously approved the legislation on Thursday by voice vote, four days after a similar vote in the Senate. Former American hostage Barry Rosen told Fox News on Friday that the decision to bar Iran's ambassadorial pick is a "great victory for America." "There are special moments in American political life when grassroots activism and a bipartisan Congressional action moves an Administration to do the right thing. This is one of those rare moments in the history of the United States," he said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who sponsored the measure in the Senate, said Friday he appreciates the president "doing the right thing" and blocking the ambassador from the U.S. "I think that's a real moment of clarity," Cruz told Fox News, in describing the bipartisan agreement on the issue. Earlier this week, Cruz called the nomination "a deliberate and unambiguous insult to the United States." The Iranian government, reacting late Friday, objected to the visa denial. The Iranian Mission to the U.N. said: "It is a regrettable decision by the US Administration which is in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations." The Iranian Mission to the United Nations will be run by Deputy Permanent Representative and Charge d'Affairs Ambassador Hossein Dehghani while the dispute is settled. The dispute comes amid nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers. U.S. immigration law allows broad rejection of visas to foreigners and, in many cases, officials do not have to give an explicit reason for why other than to deem the applicant a threat to national security or American policy. The law bars foreigners whose entry or activity in the U.S. would "have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States." It also bars people who have engaged in terrorist activity, which the law defines as including seizing and detaining others; threatening to kill, injure or continue to detain them; and violent attacks on internationally protected persons such as diplomats and other agents of the U.S. government. Iranian opposition leaders heralded the decision on Friday. "This decision is prudent and should serve as an example for other countries not to allow Iranian regime's terrorists disguised as diplomats into their territory," said Soona Samsami, the U.S. representative of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, describing Abutalebi as a "terror mastermind."  Fox News' Eric Shawn, Jonathan Wachtel and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics 
White House Tries A Kinder, Gentler Approach To Achieving Immigration Reform The White House is going to try a kinder and gentler approach to immigration reform in the hope that a carrot this year will bring more success than the stick did last year.White House officials reportedly have told leading immigration reform advocates in recent meetings that President Obama is choosing to tone down his rhetoric on the need to overhaul the system, and will give Republicans in the House of Representatives the space to work on legislation, according to Politico.Many Republicans in the House, where they have a majority, have expressed anger over what they say is Obama’s overly aggressive approach to reforming immigration. In June, the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that called for tightening border security, expanding foreign work visa programs, and providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.Last year, Obama threatened to put forth his own comprehensive measure if the Congress did not pass one — a move that angered many Republicans. House Republicans said they would not rubber-stamp the Senate bill, and added that they prefer to deal with the complex issue through smaller, separate measures.Politico quoted an unnamed White House official as saying that Obama will give House Republicans the time and flexibility they feel they need to come up with immigration bills they can put up for a vote.“We’re focused more on the result and less about the process,” the official said, according to Politico. “If they have to jump through a series of hoops, we’re happy to let the House work its will.”Some of the more conservative Republicans in the House object to providing legal status to people who live here illegally, saying that would be tantamount to rewarding law-breakers. Others in their party, however, argue that all the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants cannot be deported, and that something must be done to bring them out of the shadows.The Obama administration has taken some immigration matters into its own hands while disagreements in Congress over how to handle the issue brought work on reform to a virtual halt. One such move the president made was to suspend deportation for two years for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were minors. Those who qualified for the program have been able to get work permits and, in some states, driver’s licenses.“You’re not going to see the president talking critically or negatively about Republicans on an issue like this when he wants to see this happen,” said Jim Wallis, president of the Christian social-justice organization Sojourners. “They’re not looking for conflict here, they are looking for cooperation and collaboration.”House Republicans, meanwhile, are working on what they're calling "immigration principles" which would give potentially millions of undocumented immigrants a chance to permanently live and work in the United States.The plan, which is reportedly days away from being released to the public, will cover ideas on how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, the expansion of visas for certain foreign workers, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to published reports. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, is said to want the principles released before Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, assailed the principles."House Republican leaders must dismiss the whispers of the consultant class, the pleadings of the business lobby, and the pressure campaign from the activists who believe illegal immigration is a civil right," Sessions said in a written statement. "It would be tragic if the [Boehner's] immigration principles were simply a ‘piecemeal’ repackaging of the Senate plan."Some in the Republican camp say they are leery about the White House plans for a more conciliatory approach to immigration, Politico said.“Playing nice has not been a hallmark of this administration,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), according to Politico. “But if we’re going to solve our immigration challenges, the White House and its allies will have to understand that the House is going to take its time and get this done the right way.”On Tuesday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson visited the Texas-Mexico border.Johnson said that the surge of immigrants from countries other than Mexico crossing the border illegally presents challenges to the department.“What has been brought home to me today is that we need to continually monitor trends in border crossings,” Johnson said at the Anzalduas International Bridge. “We need to continually try to stay ahead of the game when it comes to trends, emerging trends.”While arrests of Mexican citizens remained nearly unchanged last year, arrests of immigrants from other countries, including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, increased 55 percent, according to data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday.Johnson, who won Senate confirmation to lead the Department of Homeland Security in December, did not elaborate on those challenges, but in the past year the growing flow of immigrants especially from Central America have at times overwhelmed Border Patrol stations in South Texas creating backups in processing and other logistical challenges.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Why 2014 will be the year of immigration reform The U.S. Capitol dome is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington.ReutersA curious case of generational timing can be observed in the fact that major changes to U.S. immigration policy occur once every two and half decades. It has been 27 years since the last generational shift, and other signs indicate that 2014 is likely to the “Year of Immigration Reform.” ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTBarack Obama in 2014, like Ronald Reagan in 1986, is in the sixth year of his presidency, likewise re-elected but wounded and looking for ways to cement his legacy.Outright racist protectionism led to the first border controls enacted in 1875 and 1907, including deportations and bans on Chinese, then Japanese, and ultimately all migrants from Asia. Back then, Mexican migrants were welcomed whereas Asians were not. The flow of guest workers was formalized in 1942 when the Bracero program began. Two decades and two years later, Congress fundamentally shifted immigration policy to favor family reunification in a 1965 reform, which curtailed the guest worker program. That was updated two decades and two years hence, in 1986, when President Reagan famously championed a one-time immigration amnesty.Looking back, all of the changes were fundamental, but that doesn’t mean they were big. That hints at the likely shape of 2014 reform.The previous once-a-generation laws were not intended to be earth-shaking reforms. They just turned out that way. Call it the butterfly effect if you must, or the law of unintended consequences, but the fact is that small but meaningful changes in design can have large effects.  The laws that most fundamentally shape nations and cultures usually aren’t five-thousand page tomes, but the one-line fundamentals:- Though shalt not kill.- Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.- [A]ll persons held as slaves within any … in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.That lesson explains the failed congressional efforts in 2005, 2006, and 2007 to pass “comprehensive” immigration reform. In the wake of ObamaCare, any kind of comprehensive legislation on any issue will be a non-starter for the next few years, and maybe much longer. The public is rightfully suspicious of laws that are too complex to be read, let alone executed. Policy reform will have to be incremental, focused, and transparent.For those working in the policy trenches, three big lessons were drawn from the experience of 2005-2007:First, comprehensive is a word that often was a mask insincerity, allowing opponents of reform to masquerade as proponents. Contrary to public perceptions, immigration does not divide neatly across political lines. The strongest pro-immigrant advocates tend to be libertarians in the Republican party and the most ardent opponents are unionists in the Democratic party.  Don’t forget that there are nine Democrats in the Senate now who voted against the 2007 McCain-Kennedy reform bill, people like Debbie Stabenow and Tom Harkin who share the anti-immigrant bias of their unionized base.The second lesson is that many politicians prefer inaction on issues like this because it allows them to grandstand politically. Supposedly conservative politicians can sound tough despite knowing that inaction allows the de facto amnesty to continue. Supposedly liberal politicians can pretend to be caring of Hispanics knowing that the status quo allows undocumented workers to be abused. Big Business and Big Labor are delighted while the voters are distracted.Thus the third lesson: comprehensive bills tend to include poison pills. That describes the Senate bill passed in June, seemingly humane, but designed not to become law.  If you think the bill is pro-immigrant, then you have been fooled just like most economists.Economists tend to favor more immigration at all skill levels, because they know that the effects are positive for the nation and also for native workers. A famous example is the influx of Russian immigrants to Israel in the early 1990s, increasing the national population by 7 percent in just two years. Research of the impact found a net increase in national output but also a net increase in native wages, even a proportional increase in the wages of occupations most affected.As expected, an overwhelming majority of economist I surveyed (91 percent) support increasing the number of legal immigrants (with 49 percent agreeing strongly). And when I asked these same people about a policy to penalize companies that displace native workers, 86 percent of panelists were opposed. Such a policy is hostile to immigrant workers and will cause a chilling effect on hiring of Hispanics. Yet that non-displacement rule is a little-known clause in the Senate’s comprehensive immigration reform bill, exactly the kind of poison pill that libertarians will oppose.True friends of immigration have learned to distrust the word comprehensive.The House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker John Boehner have been quietly working on a series of incremental immigration bills. Contrary to the provocative and vapid punditry claiming the Senate’s heroic efforts have “stalled” in the House, Boehner has actually shepherded these little reforms through committee, and has them poised for full passage whenever Democrats get serious about policy instead of politics. I’m betting 2014 is that time.The ground shifted a few days before Thanksgiving when the White House finally gave up on the canard of comprehensive reform. “They’re suspicious of comprehensive bills, but you know what? If they want to chop that thing up into five pieces, as long as all five pieces get done, I don’t care what it looks like,” said Mr. Obama. The very next day, congressional Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi agreed with the new approach.Maybe President Obama felt the need to change the subject from Obamacare, or maybe he was finally taking the advice of his former chief economist, Austan Goolsbee, to focus on reforms where all sides agree. Republicans are eager to present their party as more than mere obstructionists. Democrats are eager to do something, anything, besides health care. Unions who oppose migrants are weak. Entrepreneurs who favor foreign workers (many tech firms have migrant co-founders) are strong, and impatient.Here’s a little big idea supported by every think tank in D.C.: staple a green card to the diploma of every foreign-born science and engineering graduate of America’s universities. I suspect that will be the first reform of 2014, and it will open the door for more. About time.Tim Kane is a full time Research fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Why I Am Fasting For Immigration Reform In the biblical story, a young Jewish woman named Esther learns that her people are at risk as a result of an unjust law. Recognizing that God has entrusted her with a unique level of influence, Esther resolves to go before the king and plead for her people. Before she does, though, she decides to fast – to abstain from eating and focus on prayer, entrusting her situation and that of her people to God – and she urges all of the Jewish people to join in.Hispanic evangelicals in the United States are at a similar threshold. Our dysfunctional immigration system divides families, limits the ability of many to thrive economically and contribute fully to this great nation, and mocks the principles of the rule of law on which our country was founded. As a pastor, I see the impacts of this dysfunction on a regular basis.- Rev. Samuel RodriguezThat’s why I am joining others, of many faiths, in the “Fast for Families” on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. I began my fast Nov. 4. Since then I have subsisted on clear liquids. At times my body is weak, but my spirit is ever stronger.Like our white evangelical brethren, Hispanic evangelicals are strongly conservative on many traditional family issues, including life and marriage. But many Hispanic evangelicals have felt unwelcome in the Republican Party as a result of some Republicans’ rhetoric and positions on immigration policy.Because Hispanics are a quickly growing swing voting bloc, both parties seek our attention. As the president of the nation’s largest association of Hispanic evangelicals, the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, I frequently find myself in a position to bring the concerns of our community – 7.5 million strong and growing rapidly – to those in positions of authority. I’ve been entrusted with the responsibility to plea for my people before the governmental authorities who can reform an unjust, dysfunctional system.That’s why, inspired by the example of the biblical heroine Esther, I have felt compelled to fast as I continue to pray for our elected officials, and to encourage others to join me. Immigration reform is past due, and every day that goes by without reform means another 1,100 individuals are deported. Many of whom are upstanding members of our congregations who have never been convicted of any offense and who, too often, leave behind U.S. citizen spouses or children.We see the devastation of families divided week after week in our churches. Our fasting serves to emphasize the urgency of our prayers and of our pleas to Congress: This is not an issue to push off to another election cycle or for a politically convenient time. It is the right thing to do, now is the right time to do it, and you have our support.I’m grateful that tens of thousands of evangelical Christians – not just Hispanics, but our brothers and sisters of every ethnicity that make up this beautifully diverse nation – have joined us in praying for immigration reform and for our elected officials through the Pray for Reform campaign of the Evangelical Immigration Table. More than 180,000 individuals have gone online or have filled out commitment cards in church services, promising to pray, as Scripture instructs us, for those in authority over us. We will continue praying, and advocating, until Congress acts.I already see God answering our prayers in remarkable ways. For example, an unprecedented coalition of evangelical leaders have joined their voices in a call for reform that is consistent with biblical principles, including executives of nearly every major evangelical denomination, presidents of Christian colleges and seminaries, leaders of parachurch ministries, and pastors of some of the largest and most influential churches in our country.Polls now show that the majority of evangelical pastors and three quarters of evangelicals “in the pews” support reforms consistent with the principles we have laid out, including an earned process by which aspiring Americans in our communities could get right with the law and eventually earn the chance to become U.S. citizens. The church is unifying in ways I’ve never seen to stand for just, compassionate, common sense reforms to our laws.Congress has a strong role model in the evangelical church, which has bridged political, denominational, ethnic and geographic differences to find common ground on the question of immigration reform. Until Congress moves forward, I’m taking my cue from Esther and committing to fasting and prayer, pleading with God to give those in authority the wisdom and courage necessary to do what is right.The Rev. Samuel Rodriguez of Sacramento, Calif., is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
With Deadline Looming, Latino Sign-Up Rate For Obamacare Remains Dismally Low WASHINGTON (AP) –  The nation's largest minority group risks being left behind by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.Hispanics account for about one-third of the nation's uninsured, but they seem to be staying on the sidelines as the White House races to meet a goal of 6 million sign-ups by March 31.Latinos are "not at the table," says Jane Delgado, president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a nonpartisan advocacy network. "We are not going to be able to enroll at the levels we should be enrolling at."That's a loss both for Latinos who are trying to put down middle-class roots and for the Obama administration, experts said.Hispanics who remain uninsured could face fines, not to mention exposing their families to high medical bills from accidents or unforeseen illness. And the government won't get the full advantage of a group that's largely young and healthy, helping keep premiums low in the new insurance markets."The enrollment rate for Hispanic-Americans seems to be very low, and I would be really concerned about that," said Brookings Institution health policy expert Mark McClellan. "It is a large population that has a lot to gain ... but they don't seem to be taking advantage." McClellan oversaw the rollout of Medicare's prescription drug benefit for President George W. Bush.The Obama administration said it has no statistics on the race and ethnicity of those signing up in the insurance exchanges, markets that offer subsidized private coverage in every state. Consumers provide those details voluntarily, so federal officials say any tally would be incomplete and possibly misleading.But concern is showing through, and it's coming from the highest levels."You don't punish me by not signing up for health care," Obama told Hispanic audiences during a recent televised town hall. "You're punishing yourself or your family."Only last September, three of five Latinos supported the national overhaul, according to the Pew Research Center. Approval dropped sharply during October, as technical problems paralyzed the health care rollout and the Spanish-language version of the HealthCare.gov website (cuidadodesalud.gov). Hispanics are now evenly divided in their views.A Gallup survey recently showed tepid sign-up progress. While the share of African-Americans who are uninsured dropped by 2.6 percentage points this year, the decline among Hispanics was just 0.8 percentage point.In California, where Latinos account for 46 percent of those eligible for subsidized coverage through the exchange, they represented 22 percent of those who had enrolled by the end February and had also volunteered their race or ethnicity. The state is scrambling to improve its numbers in this week's home stretch.Experts cite overlapping factors behind disappointing Latino sign-ups:— A shortage of in-person helpers to guide consumers. "In our community, trust and confidence is so important — you want to make sure it's OK before you share all this personal information," Delgado said. There's been a lack of "culturally sensitive" outreach to Latinos, added Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas.— Fear that applying for health care will bring unwelcome scrutiny from immigration authorities. The health insurance exchanges are only for citizens and legal U.S. residents, but many Hispanic families have mixed immigration status. Some members may be native born, while others might be here illegally. Obama has tried to dispel concerns, saying information on applications will not be shared with immigration authorities.—The decision by many Republican-led states not to expand Medicaid, as they could under the law. With states like Texas and Florida refusing to expand Medicaid, many low-income Latinos will remain uninsured. However, Medicaid expansion is separate from coverage on the exchanges, which is available in every state. Latinosdon't seem motivated to sign up for that, either.— Technical difficulties that delayed the federal government's Spanish-language enrollment site. CuidadoDeSalud.gov has also had to cope with clunky translations.Delgado's group is asking the administration to extend the March 31 deadline for Latinos who got tangled up in website problems. Officials said that's not likely. However, they haven't ruled out a little extra time for anyone who started an application but wasn't able to finish by the deadline.A recent enrollment outreach event in Houston drew Mary Nunez, who works with her self-employed husband in the florist business. They have been uninsured since she lost her job last year. In that time, she's only been to a doctor once — to get a refill on blood-pressure medication."Praise the Lord, we haven't gotten sick," said Nunez, adding that she knows luck eventually will run out.She made an appointment for in-person assistance to review her options on the Texas exchange. But since the couple's income fluctuates from month to month, she was uncertain how much they could afford. A deadline is looming, she noted, and "Hispanics always leave it for the last minute."Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
With Immigration Reform Clock Having Run Out, Activists Contemplate What's Next With all chance of passing a sweeping immigration reform gone in the remaining five legislative days of 2013, advocates of an overhaul of the system are trying to figure out what to do next.The rallies and demonstrations have not let up.On Monday, young immigrants from Florida, North Carolina and Texas arrived in Washington, D.C., to push for immigration reform. They delivered letters to lawmakers’ offices describing the impact that the deportations of their parents and other family members had on them. They held a press conference to argue for reform and staged a skit that starred “Grinch Boehner,” after the House Speaker John Boehner, and blamed him for tearing families apart.Also on Monday, immigration reform activists in California were planning to begin a four-day fast outside the offices of Rep. John Campbell to call on Congress to work on a measure. They are the latest in a fasting movement that began in mid-November in Washington.On Tuesday, the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) plans to make the case for immigration reform with a press event at its D.C. offices to mark the release of a study that shows that “immigration reform would produce powerful benefits to the U.S. economy," according to a statement issued by the group.“Notably, the study showed that immigration reform would jump-start the housing market by increasing spending on residential construction by an average of $68 billion annually over a 20-year period.”The BPC event will include Ed Brady, CEO of Brady Homes, former Housing secretary Henry Cisneros and former U.S. Senator Mel Martinez.BPC president Jason Grumet said that the impasse in Congress on immigration reform is no reason to assume the issue is dead.Boehner a few weeks ago dashed remaining hopes of a vote on an immigration bill this year when he stated it would not happen during this session. But he recently hired a veteran immigration reform activist, BPC’s Becky Tallent, to focus on immigration-reform work.Frustration has been mounting among advocates of more flexible immigration policies over the stalled effort in the House of Representatives to bring a measure to a vote.Republicans in the House, where they have the majority, have resisted bills that would offer a path to legal status to undocumented immigrants.The Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform measure in June that provides such a path as well as, among other things, tightens security along the border, steps up interior enforcement and expands foreign worker visas.“The House is going to continue to chart its own course on immigration reform. Becky [Tallent] understands the issues – both those that should be on the table and those that have derailed past reform efforts,” said Grumet, BPC’s president. “Becky’s recent experience forging solutions among BPC’s diverse task force members will serve her and Speaker Boehner well in the months ahead. She will be a crucial resource in crafting legislation that can pass the House and be signed by the president.”Groups that oppose immigration reform measures that would let undocumented immigrants legalize their status also vow to continue to work to make sure it doesn’t happen. Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, which has played a critical role in the defeat of past reform efforts, said recently that his members would keep up the pressure on lawmakers not to pass an “amnesty” for people who have broken immigration laws or measures that would allow more foreign competition for U.S. jobs.Boehner refused to commit to bringing a bill or bills to a vote in 2014 when asked recently by reporters at a daily briefing. But Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, believes an election year may work in favor a measure being passed.“There is obviously not enough time to pass immigration reform in 2013,” Nowrasteh  said. “The Syrian crisis, Obamacare’s disastrous rollout, and the government shutdown, among other things, got in the way.”“The last three  immigration reforms that became law – including Reagan’s 1986 amnesty – happened during election years,” he said. “Immigration reform laws in 1986, 1990, and 1996 were all controversial but were passed by Congress and signed into law during those years, and it could happen again in 2014.”Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatinoLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatinoElizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
With A Little Help From Mark Zuckerberg, Joe Green Applies High Tech Strategies To Immigration Advocacy Joe Green, a 29-year-old, bespectacled Silicon Valley tech whiz, is not what you envision when you think of an immigration advocate. Even so, Green, Mark Zuckerberg’s roommate at Harvard and the sixth user on Facebook, is becoming a major player in the immigration reform fight, combining social media, high tech and political advocacy to build momentum for a comprehensive measure that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and expand visas for foreign workers. Green is co-founder and president of Fwd.us, a political advocacy group funded by Zuckerberg and other high-tech executives, and he recently spoke to Fox News Latino about navigating D.C. politics and how his interest in immigration issues developed.FNL: It is said about you that even in college, you were interested in political issues, political causes,  combining that with your interest in technology. How did interest in politics begin?JG: When I was a kid I got interested in politics.I went to Santa Monica High School, there were 3,500 kids, minority-majority.  It was a very diverse environment. I had a lot of friends who were undocumented.I ran for the Santa Monica School Board when I was 17, and I got elected.(Green’s campaign focused on a living wage for Santa Monica hotel and restaurant workers, many of whom were immigrants.)When I got to Harvard, I realized that [the diversity at Santa Monica H.S.] was a rare experience.At Harvard I got a chance to study with Marshall Ganz, who worked alongside Cesar Chavez. I was taught old school community organizing.What you learn is that community organizing is all about friendships. And the Internet is all about relationships.I ended up being someone who cares a lot about politics who also worked in tech.(Barely out of his teens, Green started several online projects that combined social media and political causes. Among them were Causes, which used social networking to raise money for nonprofits, and NationBuilder, which facilitates political organizing.)FNL: High tech increasingly is getting involved in the immigration reform movement. Many people say it’s driven by a desire to find workers. Explain the role of high tech on this divisive issue.JG: High tech is a very idealistic community, interested in making changes [for the better].But it is also a very politically disconnect community. The folks in tech are somewhere between uninterested and suspicious of Washington. Their single biggest challenge in growing their companies is finding the right people. In the start-ups I had, 75 percent of what I spent was on payroll. You’re constantly struggling and competing to find the right people.We’re in this transition from the industrial era to the knowledge era. We as a country have to adapt to that. What are the policies we can pursue to make the knowledge economy more inclusive?(Early this year, Green teamed up again with his old Harvard roommate, Zuckerberg, persuading him to get involved in the issue of immigration reform. The result was Fwd.us, a political advocacy group that has as one of its key targets changes in immigration. The group is funded by Zuckerberg and several other high-tech executives.)FNL: Tell us about Fwd.us and its involvement in immigration reform.JG: When I was working on NationBuilder, I got to know a lot of political operatives. I said “What could we do to be helpful [in the immigration reform push]? If we helped, what would it look like? We have people in tech who are willing to devote a lot of resources.”When you look at the immigration reform issue through an outsider’s eyes, it’s not really a policy challenge. It’s a political challenge.[Fwd.us’s involvement] would have to be [about] helping to create political support. So we came up with this structure, that is pretty unique, built on being political, but being on both sides. It was important that we had credibility. As a bunch of tech guys, they [politicians] were probably not going to trust us.(Green and others with Fwd.us have met several times this year with both GOP and Democrat leaders in Congress.)The Republicans said “We can’t be in the position of helping Democrats.” And we heard the same thing from Democrats.So we created “Americans For A Conservative Direction,” and we also created a liberal group. They’re separate groups, with separate boards and directors, but we fund all of them. The conservative group decides how to help Republicans (who advocate for immigration reform) in their own language.FNL: Many people with more conservative views object to parts of immigration reform, particularly parts that focus on expanding work visa programs and providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. What would you tell them?JG: I’ve had the chance to speak at tech conferences in other countries, and the thing you hear over and over again is that the biggest difference they see between their countries and America is embracing risk and acceptance of failure. It’s OK to fail in America. If you’re an entrepreneur, that’s really important. That comes from being a nation of immigrants.My grandfather’s parents came from a little village in Romania. They’d never been two or three miles from their village, but they decided they were going to get on a ship for several weeks to go half way around the world, to a country they never even seen a picture of. Everyone and everything they’d ever known they would never see again.That is riskier than starting an entrepreneurship; if you left everything behind, what do you have to lose?My ancestors did not have any formal education when they left their home countries. That’s true of most people who come to America. As entrepreneurs, we identify with that. We should encourage people who have that will. Why put artificial roadblocks?FNL: Fwd.us recently made the headlines for holding a hackathon in Silicon Valley for more than 20 young college-age undocumented immigrants who worked on programs – focused on immigration reform – with you, Mark Zuckerberg, other executives and coders. One of the most notable things was that you all stayed with the immigrants during nearly the whole time, working with them on the projects.JG: Mark and Drew’s [Houston, founder of Dropbox] reaction on stage showed that they were genuinely impressed. We were blown away.All the [immigrant] teams finished, and they finished with something impressive. In a typical hackathon, only 30 or 40 percent of teams actually finish.What’s amazing about those kids is that they have overcome big major obstacles – not getting financial aid, not being able to attend college at in-state tuition [rates]. That grit and determination that comes out of that experience is something that you can’t teach. Hackathons are really about how much grit and focus you have.FNL: You and Zuckerberg and other CEO’s at the hackathon picked three winners. What has happened since, and what happens from here with those kids and projects?JG: Many of the groups want to keep working and we want to keep helping them. We have a large online distribution ability.  FNL: There were high expectations about immigration reform passing this year, but that fizzled. Congress is very divided on the issue. Do you think it can still happen?JG: Immigration reform is one of the most important political things we can do. It’s the right thing to do morally. Even Republican primary voters support this issue. It’s time to do this. Every moment you wait there’s a real human impact.There’s a lot of stuff that America is not the best at, but when you travel around the world you see that America is pro-immigrant. That is not something that people in most countries share.You can’t become Japanese, or French. We are better than almost anybody else at welcoming people from around the world. But here’s the idea that here, you can become American.Elizabeth Llorente can be reached elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.comFollow Elizabeth Llorente on https://twitter.com/Liz_LlorenteLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino 
Woman, 73, accused of operating drug tunnel uncovered under Mexican border  Tucked inside one of a string of warehouses, hidden behind boxes of televisions and plastic three-wheel toys, under a concrete slab and down a 70-foot shaft, is a tunnel Mexican drug dealers hoped to use to move hundreds of pounds of marijuana and cocaine into the U.S. But on Friday, agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Tuesday’s discovery of the tunnel and arrested the woman accused of overseeing its construction, 73-year-old Glennys "Gladys" Rodriguez, of Chula Vista, Calif. Authorities had been watching the warehouse for months.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“Here we are again, foiling cartel plans to sneak millions of dollars of illegal drugs through secret passageways that cost millions of dollars to build,” said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. “Going underground is not a good business plan. We have promised to locate these super tunnels and keep powerful drug cartels from taking their business underground and out of sight, and once again, we have delivered on that promise.”- U.S. Attorney Laura DuffyThis was the sixth cross-border passageway discovered in the San Diego area in less than four years. A seventh was found Thursday nearby. If laid end-to-end, the seven tunnels would extend a distance of nearly two miles.Agents from the San Diego Tunnel Task Force uncovered the two sophisticated smuggling tunnels in an area known as Otay Mesa, an industrial park surrounded by rolling hills, desert and several major freeways connecting the U.S. to Tijuana and large manufacturing plants south of the border.The first tunnel, approximately 600 yards long, was discovered Tuesday evening based on evidence developed during a five-month probe by the task force. The passageway - equipped with lighting, a crude rail system and wooden trusses - exits inside a warehouse. The entrance to the tunnel was 2 1/2 square feet and led to a 15-foot walkway. At the end was a 70-foot vertical shaft equipped with a half-ton winch and pulley system to hoist contraband up into the warehouse.Rental records show the warehouse was rented by Ignacio Ituarte, but the money was provided by his girlfriend, Rodriguez, according to a complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's office Thursday. Rodriguez, who drives a white Cadillac, gave Ituarte $10,000 to lease the warehouse while the tunnel was constructed and $1,729 monthly thereafter.Arrested Tuesday, Rodriguez told agents she owns a business that provides immigration services and prepares taxes and attempted to hide her connection to the warehouse, despite surveillance evidence to contrary. She is charged in a criminal complaint with conspiring with others to maintain a drug involved premises. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California is prosecuting the case.The second tunnel was detected Thursday morning. It also originates in Tijuana and stretches  more than 700 yards. It is equipped with a multi-tiered electric rail system and an array of ventilation equipment.“The discovery of these tunnels reaffirms yet again the vigilance and tenacity of our multi-agency task force,” said Derek Benner, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. “While technology certainly plays a part in our ongoing efforts, ultimately these investigations often owe more to the powers of observation and old fashioned detective work - and that was exactly what happened here.”Agents cannot say how much drugs moved through the tunnels before they were discovered.“Once again, the Tunnel Task Force has eliminated a multi-million dollar drug smuggling venture and have reduced it to nothing more than a colossal waste of money on the part of the drug cartels,” said Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) San Diego Special Agent in Charge William Sherman. “Our goal is to not only shut these tunnels down before they become operational, but to ensure that the cartels backing these elaborate smuggling operations are investigated and prosecuted.”William La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based correspondent. 
Zeituni Onyango, Obama aunt who lived in US illegally, dies at 61 November 24, 2009: President Barack Obama's aunt Zeituni Onyango speaks to The Associated Press during an interview in her home in Boston. Onyango, whose status as an illegal immigrant was revealed days before Obama was elected in 2008, died Tuesday, according to Cleveland attorney Margaret Wong, who represented Onyango in her immigration case. She was 61. (AP Photo/Josh Reynolds, File)BOSTON –  President Barack Obama's aunt Zeituni Onyango, who was denied asylum in the United States but stayed illegally for years, died Tuesday at age 61.Onyango, whose immigration status was reported by The Associated Press days before Obama's election in 2008, had been treated in recent months for cancer and respiratory problems, Cleveland attorney Margaret Wong said. She died in a Boston rehabilitation center, said Wong, who represented her in her immigration case.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTOnyango, a half-sister of Obama's late father, moved from Kenya to the U.S. in 2000 and was denied asylum by an immigration judge in 2004. She remained in the country illegally, living in Boston public housing.She finally was granted asylum in 2010 by a judge who said she could be in danger if she returned to Kenya because of her relationship with Obama.Onyango was born in Kenya in May 1952 under a mango tree and was delivered by a midwife, Wong said. She raised a family in Kenya and worked in the computer department of Kenya Breweries, she said."She was an awesome, funny, shrewd, smart lady born at the wrong place at the wrong time," Wong said. "If she was only born in America or born in more Western open society instead of being bogged down by tribes, lineage and being a woman in Kenya, she could have been anything she wanted to be."Wong said Onyango had become ill in January and died early Tuesday morning in her sleep.The White House, which had no immediate reaction to Onyango's death on Tuesday, had said previously that Obama did not intervene in her immigration case.Obama, in his memoir "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance," affectionately referred to Onyango as Auntie Zeituni and described meeting her during his 1988 trip to Kenya. She helped care for his half-brothers and sister while living with his father, Barack Obama Sr., in Kenya.Daily must-read stories from the biggest name in politics
